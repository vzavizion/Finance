				high-level route

				START CARDADA, LOCARNO
				FINISH MERGOSCIA
				LENGTH 10KM; 3¾ TO FIVE HOURS

				From the upper cable-car station at Cardada, head right, climbing around the open slopes to reach the rustic stone hut of Capanna Lo Stallone in the grassy hollow of Alpe Cardada (1486m), after 30 to 40 minutes. The track cuts back left over the bracken-covered mountainsides, then swings right to skirt the forest and arrive at 1671m Capanna Cimetta.
				Below the upper chairlift station, the left-hand path descends quickly to a saddle (1610m) with a springwater fountain. Make a rising traverse of the southwestern slopes of Cima della Trosa. A short side trail brings you to the cross mounted on the windswept 1869m summit after a further 35 to 45 minutes.
				The path soon winds down Cima della Trosa’s northeastern flank to a minor col (1657m). From here a side trip to the often snow-dusted peak of Madone (2039m) takes 1½ to two hours; the straightforward route follows the ridge, with some harmless rock-scrambling and arresting views higher up.
				Descend in broad zigzags to Alpe di Bietri (1499m), stopping for creamy goat’s cheese made at the dairy, then continuing on an old mule trail tracing the northern slopes of Valle di Mergoscia. The route descends gently past dilapidated houses and rustic hamlets to reach Bresciadiga (1128m), 1¼ to 1¾ hours from Cima della Trosa.
				Bear right at a junction, leading past small shrines before coming into a car park. Stroll 600m downhill to intersect with the main road, then follow the sealed road left up steep, vine-clad hillsides to arrive at the square beside the large baroque church of postcard-pretty Mergoscia, sitting high above the Val Verzasca, after a final one-to-1¼-hour leg. From Mergoscia, bus 312 runs every two hours back to Locarno (Sfr6.20, 37 minutes).
