Switzerland’s Top 15

Matterhorn
No mountain has so much pulling power, natural magnetism or is so easy to become obsessed with as this charismatic peak – a beauty from birth who demands to be admired, ogled and repeatedly photographed at sunset, sunrise, in different seasons and from every last infuriating angle. And there is no finer place to pander to Matterhorn’s every last topographic need than Zermatt, one of Europe’s most highly desirable Alpine resorts, in fashion with the skiing, climbing, hiking and hip hobnobbing set since the 19th century.

Hiking in the Swiss National Park
No country in Europe is more synonymous with magnificent and mighty hiking beneath eagle-dotted skies than Switzerland, and its high-altitude national park created a century ago is the place to do it. Follow trails through flower-strewn meadows to piercing blue lakes, knife-edge ravines, rocky outcrops and Alpine huts where shepherds make summertime cheese with cows’ milk, taken fresh that morning from the herd. It's nature gone wild and on the rampage, and is a rare and privileged glimpse of Switzerland before the dawn of tourism.

Aletsch Glacier
One of the world’s natural marvels, this mesmerising glacier of gargantuan proportions in the Upper Valais is tantamount to a 23km-long, five-lane highway of ice powering between mountain peaks at altitude. Its ice is glacial-blue and 900m thick at its deepest point. The view of Aletsch from Jungfraujoch will make your heart sing, but for the hardcore adrenalin surge nothing beats getting up close: hike between crevasses with a mountain guide from Riederalp, or ski above it on snowy pistes in Bettmeralp.

Europe’s Largest Lake
The emerald vines marching uphill in perfect unison from the shores of Lake Geneva in Lavaux are staggering. But the urban viewpoint from which to admire and experience Europe’s largest lake is Geneva, French-speaking Switzerland’s most cosmopolitan city, where canary-yellow mouettes (seagulls) ferry locals across the water and Mont Blanc peeps in on the action. Strolling Old Town streets, savouring a vibrant cafe society, paddle-boarding on the lake and making the odd dash beneath its iconic pencil fountain is what life’s about for the 180 nationalities living here.

The Glacier Express
It’s among the world’s most mythical train rides, linking two of Switzerland’s glitziest Alpine resorts. Hop aboard the red train with floor-to-ceiling windows in St Moritz or Zermatt, and savour shot after cinematic shot of green peaks, glistening Alpine lakes, glacial ravines and other hallucinatory natural landscapes. Pulled by steam engine when it first puffed out of the station in 1930, the Glacier Express traverses 91 tunnels and 291 bridges on its famous journey. Lunch in the vintage restaurant car or bring your own Champagne picnic.

Romance in Montreux
As if being host to one of the world’s most mythical jazz festivals, with open-air concerts on the shore of Lake Geneva is not enough, Montreux has a castle to add to the French-style romance. From the well-known lakeside town with a climate so mild that palm trees grow, a flower-framed footpath follows the water south to Château de Chillon. Historic, sumptuous and among Switzerland’s oldest, this magnificent stone château built by the Savoys in the 13th century is everything a castle should be.

Capital Bern
Medieval cobbled streets, arcaded boutiques, a dancing clock and folk figures prettily frolicking in fountains since the 16th century: Switzerland’s capital city, Bern, just does not fit in with the quintessential ‘capital city’ image at all. Indeed, few even realise this small town situated in the flat, unassuming, middle bit of the country (hence the region’s name, Mittelland), where farms make Emmental cheese, is the capital. Yet its very unexpectedness, cemented by the cutting-edge hills of Renzo Piano’s Zentrum Paul Klee, is precisely its charm.

Lakeside Lucerne
Medieval bridge-strolling is the charm of this irresistible Romeo in Central Switzerland. Throw sparkling lake vistas, an alfresco cafe life, candy-coloured architecture and Victorian curiosities into the cooking pot and, yes, lakeside Lucerne could well be the start of a very beautiful love affair. With the town under your belt, step back to savour the ensemble from a wider perspective: views across the lake of green hillsides, meadows and hidden lake resorts from atop Mt Pilatus, Mt Rigi or Stanserhorn will not disappoint.

Epic Outdoors
No trio are more immortalised in mountaineering legend than Switzerland’s ‘big three’ – Eiger (Ogre), Mönch (Monk) and Jungfrau (Virgin) – peaks that soar to the sky above the traditional 19th-century resort of gorgeous old Grindelwald. And whether you choose to schuss around on skis, shoot down Europe’s longest toboggan run on the back of an old-fashioned sledge, bungee-jump in the Gletscherschlucht or ride the train up to Europe’s highest station at 3454m, your heart will thump. James Bond, eat your heart out.

Splash of the Rheinfall
So moved were Goethe and Lord Byron by the wispy waterfalls of Staubbach Falls, their fairy-tale threads of spray ensnaring the cliffside in Lauterbrunnen, that they composed poems exalting their ethereal beauty. Yet it is the theatrical, crash-bang-wallop splash of the thunderous Rheinfall, guarded by a twin set of medieval castles, in northeastern Switzerland that really takes your breath away. To appreciate the full drama of it all, ride the panoramic lift up to the Känzeli viewing platform in medieval Schloss Laufen.

Zürich Lifestyle
One of Europe’s most liveable cities, Zürich in German-speaking Switzerland is an ode to urban renovation. It’s also hip (yes, this is where Google employees shoot down a slide to lunch). With enough of a rough edge that it resembles Berlin at times, a visit to Zürich means drinking in waterfront bars, dancing until dawn in Züri-West, shopping for recycled fashion accessories in Kreis 5 and boogying with the best of them at Europe’s largest street party, the city’s wild and wacky, larger-than-life Street Parade in August.

Sion & Valaisian Wine
Swiss vintages are hardly plentiful outside Switzerland, making their tasting and discovery in situ a rare and joyous experience. Gentle walking trails tread quietly through steeply terraced vineyards in Valais, producer of the country’s most rated wines, and many vignerons (winegrowers) open their doors for tasting and buying. For the perfect marriage, pair a vineyard walk with the region’s autumnal brisolée, the traditional harvest feast built around local chestnuts, cheese, cold meats and vin nouveau. The town of Sion, with its cinematic twinset of castles and plethora of gourmet addresses, is the place to taste, appreciate and enjoy.

Art & Architecture in Basel
Contemporary architecture of world-class standing is Basel’s golden ticket – seven winners of the Pritzker Prize have a living design that can be ogled in or around this city on the Rhine. Kick off with a hop across the German border to the Vitra Design Museum, designed by architect Frank Gehry, and devote the rest of the day to Switzerland’s best private collection of modern art in a long, light-flooded building by Renzo Piano – the dream fusion of art and architecture at Fondation Beyeler.

Lago di Lugano
An intrinsic part of Switzerland’s unique charm is its mixed bag of languages and cultures. And no spot on Swiss earth exalts the country’s Italianate soul with such gusto as Lago di Lugano in Ticino, a shimmering Alpine lake fringed with palm-tree promenades and pretty villages of delicate pastel hues. Lugano, the biggest town on the lake and the country’s third-largest affluent banking centre to boot, is vivacious and busy with porticoed alleys, cafe-packed piazzas and boats yo-yoing around the lakeside destinations.

Rural Jura
Tiptoe off the tourist map and into clover-shaped Jura, a fascinating backwater on the French–Swiss border woven from thick dark forests, gentle rolling hills, medieval villages and a go-slow vibe. No piece of scenery is too large, too high or too racy here. Rather, travel in the rural Jura is an exquisite sensory experience laced with inspirational bike rides, cross-country skiing through silent glades, fragrant nights in hay barns, fabulous farm feasts and cheese cut in the shape of a flower.
