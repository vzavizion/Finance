	hiking
There are some 360km of marked hiking trails in and around Engelberg. For gentle ambles and gorgeous scenery, head for Brunni on the opposite side of the valley. The Brunni cable car ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.brunni.ch; cable car one-way/return Sfr18/30, incl chairlift one-way/return Sfr26/42) goes up to Ristis at 1600m, where a chairlift takes you to the Swiss Alpine Club's refurbished Brunni Hütte ( GOOGLE MAP ; %041 637 37 32; www.berghuette.ch; dm adult/child Sfr26/14, incl breakfast & dinner adult Sfr65, child Sfr18-41). From here you can watch a magnificent sunset before spending the night.
More strenuous hikes include the trek over the Surenenpass (2291m) to Attinghausen, where you can catch a bus to Altdorf and the southern end of Lake Uri, and the climb over Jochpass (2210m) to Meiringen via Engstlenalp. Pick up a map and check on snow conditions before attempting these more demanding treks.
Skiing & Snowboarding
Snowboarders catch big air on Titlis, Engstlenalp and the half-pipe at Jochpass, while novice and intermediate skiers slide over to family-friendly Brunni and Gerschnialp for baby blues and cruisy reds. The real thrills for powder hounds, however, lie off-piste. Backcountry legends include Laub, Steinberg and the biggest leg-burner of all, Galtiberg, running from Klein Titlis to the valley 2000m below. A one-day ski pass costs Sfr62.
There’s a Ski & Snowboard School ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %041 639 54 54; www.skischule-engelberg.ch; Klosterstrasse 3; h8am-5.30pm) inside the tourist office, and places to hire ski/snowboard gear (from about Sfr50 per day) throughout town. Ski Lodge Engelberg is another great source of information, or stop by Dani’s Okay Ski Shop ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %041 637 07 77; www.okay-shop.com; Hotel Bellevue, Bahnhofplatz), where hardcore riders hang out and exchange tips.
In December, Engelberg hosts the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup (www.weltcup-engelberg.ch).

A five-minute walk from the train station; can help with hotel reservations.
8Getting There & Around
Engelberg is the southern terminus of the Engelberg Express train, which runs hourly to/from Lucerne (Sfr17.40, 45 minutes). Day-trippers should check the Lucerne tourist office’s Mt Titlis excursion tickets. A small road off the A2 freeway near Stans leads to Engelberg.
From late April through October, a free shuttle bus leaves Engelberg's train station roughly every half-hour between 8am and 5pm for all the village’s major hotels and attractions. In winter, free ski buses follow multiple routes to and from the slopes.
MT TITLIS

With a name that makes English speakers titter, Titlis ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.titlis.ch) is Central Switzerland’s tallest mountain, has its only glacier and is reached by the world’s first revolving cable car ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.titlis.ch/en/tickets/cable-car-ride; adult/child return Sfr89/44.50; h8.30am-5pm), completed in 1992. However, that’s the last leg of a breathtaking three-stage journey. First, you glide up to Trübsee (1800m) via Gerschnialp (1300m; don't get off at Gerschnialp if you're continuing to the top). Next, a larger gondola at Trübsee whisks you up to Stand (2450m), where you board the revolving Rotair for the final head-spinning journey over the dazzling Titlis Glacier. As you twirl above the deeply crevassed ice, peaks rise like shark fins ahead, while tarn-speckled pastures, cliffs and waterfalls lie behind.
A glacial blast of air hits you at Titlis station (3020m). Inside is a kind of high-altitude theme park, with a marvellously kitsch ice cave where you can watch neon lights make the sculpted ice tunnels sparkle. There’s also an overpriced restaurant and a nostalgic photo studio on the 4th floor, which specialises in snaps of Bollywood stars in dirndls. Strike a pose with a giant Toblerone or an alpenhorn against a backdrop of fake snowy mountains from Sfr35.
The genuine oohs and ahs come when you step out onto the terrace, where the panorama of glacier-capped peaks stretches to Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau in the Bernese Oberland. For even more thrilling views, step onto the adjacent Cliff Walk (www.titlis.ch/en/glacier/cliff-walk; h9.15am-4.45pm), a 100m-long, 1m-wide, cable-supported swinging walkway that qualified as Europe's highest suspension bridge when opened in 2012. More ambitious hikers can tackle the 45-minute climb to Titlis' 3239m summit (wear sturdy shoes).
For winter sports thrills even in midsummer, take the Ice Flyer chairlift (adult/child Sfr12/6; h9.30am-4.30pm) down to the Glacier Park (www.titlis.ch/en/glacier/glacier-park; h9.30am-4.30pm), where there are free snow tubes, scooters and sledges to test out. The nearby freestyle park has a half-pipe and good summer snowboarding.
The return trip to Titlis (roughly 45 minutes each way) costs Sfr89 from Engelberg. However, in fine weather, you can walk some sections. Between Stand and Trübsee, the Geologischer Wanderweg is open from July to September; it takes about two hours up and 1½ hours down. From Trübsee up to Jochpass (2207m) takes about 1½ hours, and down to Engelberg takes around the same time.
If you’re hiking, destinations from Engelberg include Gerschnialp (one-way/return Sfr8/12), Trübsee (Sfr21/30), Jochpass (Sfr31/44) and Stand (Sfr36/51). Reductions on all fares, including to Titlis, are 50% for Swiss, Eurail and InterRail pass holders.
The last ascent by cable car is at 3.40pm, last descent at 4.50pm; it closes for maintenance for two weeks in early November.
Zug
Pop 27,537 / Elev 426m
On the face of it, Zug appears like many other Swiss towns: lapped by a lake and ringed by mountains. However, this is the richest city in one of the world’s richest countries. But you probably won’t care as you devour Kirschtorte, stroll the cobblestoned medieval streets or savour million-dollar sunsets, because Zug’s low-key like that.
1Sights & Activities
Zug's well-preserved medieval Old Town, 1km south of the train station, revolves around the Zytturm (Kolinplatz) – an attractive clock tower whose roof is distinctively tiled in blue-and-white cantonal colours. Walking through the arch, you can veer off into the pedestrian-only lanes of Fischmarkt, Ober Altstadt and Unter Altstadt, punctuated by frescoed 15th-century town houses and hole-in-the-wall boutiques. Watch for the fountain depicting Gret Schell, an old hag of a Fasnacht character, who lugs her drunken husband home in a basket. Beaches and other public spaces line the pretty lakefront, which is also fun to explore by boat or bicycle.
Kunsthaus ZugMUSEUM
(%041 725 33 44; www.kunsthauszug.ch; Dorfstrasse 27; adult/child Sfr10/free; hnoon-6pm Tue-Fri, 10am-5pm Sat & Sun)

Museum Burg ZugMUSEUM
(%041 728 29 70; www.burgzug.ch; Kirchenstrasse 11; adult/child Sfr10/free; h2-5pm Tue-Sat, from 10am Sun)
Zug's town museum, housed in an 11th-century castle, displays paintings, costumes and a 3D model of the town, plus special themed exhibitions. It’s an excellent introduction to Zug – and its past tendency to partially sink into the lake.
LandsgemeindeplatzSQUARE
This popular waterfront square houses an aviary of exotic birds, including kookaburras, snowy owls and a family of scarlet ibis.
Seebad SeelikenSWIMMING

Zugerberg BahnCABLE CAR
(www.zbb.ch)
This funicular rises to Zugerberg (925m), with impressive views and hiking trails. The Zug day pass (Sfr14.80) is the best deal, as it covers all bus rides and the funicular. From the train station, bus 11 (15 minutes) gets you to the lower funicular station at Schönegg.

With the cheerful (albeit self-serving) motto, 'Keep your curves – enjoy life!', this old-style cafe is a quaint marriage between an English tearoom and an ultra-Swiss bakery. Locals swear by its Zuger Kirschtorte (pastry, biscuit, almond paste and butter cream cake, infused with cherry liqueur); grab a slice (Sfr4.50) or the whole cake (seven sizes from Sfr12.50 to Sfr48.50).

8Getting There & Away
Zug is on the main north–south train route from Zürich (Sfr16.60, 25 to 45 minutes) to Lugano. Trains also run regularly to Lucerne (Sfr11.40, 20 to 45 minutes).
For drivers, the north–south N4 runs just west of town, offering good connections north to Zürich, and south towards Lucerne, St Gotthard Pass, Lugano and Italy.
In summer, Zugersee Schifffahrt (www.zugersee-schifffahrt.ch) operates boats from Zug’s Schiffsstation, north of Landsgemeindeplatz, to Arth and other destinations around the lake.
BOOMTOWN RATS

Once upon a time, Zug was home to struggling farmers. But 1946 marked the start of its rags-to-riches transformation, when the cantonal government decided to implement one of the world’s lowest tax rates. Suddenly tycoons and global multinationals bypassed Zürich to flock here. Today Zug’s 29,000-odd registered companies include Biogen, Transocean, Shell Brands International and the world’s richest commodities trader, Glencore.
Though Zug might seem unassuming, even a modest apartment can cost at least Sfr1.5 million, so you need to be rich to milk this cash cow.
Andermatt
Pop 1320 / Elev 1447m
Blessed with austere mountain appeal, Andermatt contrasts low-key village charm with big wilderness. Once an important staging-post on the north–south St Gotthard route, Andermatt is now bypassed by the tunnel, but remains a major crossroads, with the Furka Pass corkscrewing west to Valais and the Oberalp Pass looping east to Graubünden.
The Orascom leisure development group has recently invested Sfr1 billion towards construction of a year-round megaresort in Andermatt. In December 2013 the company opened its five-star hotel, followed in 2014 by an 18-hole high-altitude golf course. More hotels are planned, but for now the traditional charm of the town centre remains blissfully intact.
1Sights & Activities
As Andermatt is situated near four major Alpine passes – Susten, Oberalp, St Gotthard and Furka – it’s a terrific base for hiking, cycling and bus tours. The tourist office distributes free bilingual (German-English) booklets outlining hiking and cycling opportunities. Check www.postbus.ch for current bus tour offerings.
GemsstockMOUNTAIN
(www.skiarena.ch)
The 2963m mountain, reached by the Gemsstockbahn cable car from Andermatt (one-way/return Sfr36/50), attracts hikers in summer and intermediate skiers coming for the snow-sure slopes in winter. The region is also beloved by off-piste skiers seeking fresh powder. Ski passes cost Sfr58 per day for Gemsstock; passes for the nearby slopes of Nätschen/Gütsch and Realp cost Sfr48 and Sfr29, respectively. Toboggan runs, well-prepared walking trails and sleigh rides appeal to nonskiers in winter.
Steam TrainsRAILWAY
(Dampfbahn Furka-Bergstrecke; www.dfb.ch; one-way/return Sfr73/121; hFri-Sun late Jun–late Sep, daily early Jul–mid-Aug)
From Realp, along the flat valley, steam trains run via Furka to Oberwald. Realp is 9km southwest of Andermatt.
HikingHIKING
One popular hike leads from the nearby Oberalp Pass to sparkly Lai da Tuma, the source of the Rhine. Drive or take a train to the pass; the 11km round trip takes three to four hours, with 500m elevation gain.
For a vertigo-inducing climb, check out the Diavolo via ferrata, a three-hour round-trip scramble over granite faces and grassy ledges. It affords dizzying perspectives over the Devil’s Bridge, which crosses the precipitous Schöllenen Gorge of the Reuss River.
4Sleeping & Eating
The tourist office can help find private rooms; note that many places close between the peak winter and summer seasons. There are numerous restaurants along Gotthardstrasse; restaurants at Hotel Sonne and River House Boutique hotel are also open to non-guests.

8Information
The tourist office (%041 888 71 00; www.andermatt.ch; Gotthardstrasse 2; h8am-noon & 1.15-5pm Mon-Fri, to 4pm Sat & Sun), 200m east of the station, shares the same hut (and hours) as the postal bus ticket office.
8Getting There & Away
The train station is 400m north of the village centre. If arriving from Zürich (Sfr44, two hours), Locarno (Sfr40, 1¾ hours) or other points north and south, you'll need to change trains at Göschenen for the final 10-minute climb to Andermatt.
Andermatt is also directly linked by the east–west Glacier Express (www.glacierexpress.ch; reservation required) to Zermatt (Sfr70, three hours) and St Moritz (Sfr80, five hours).
AMatterhorn Gotthard Bahn (www.mgbahn.ch) can supply details about the car-carrying trains over the Oberalp Pass to Graubünden and through the Furka Tunnel to Valais. Postal buses stop by the train station.
The 15km St Gotthard Tunnel is one of the busiest north–south routes across the Alps, running from Göschenen to close to Airolo (Ticino), bypassing Andermatt. The new St Gotthard Base Tunnel, designed for high-speed and freight trains, will be the world’s longest rail tunnel and is scheduled to open in early 2017.

Why Go?
The summer air is rich and hot. Vespas scoot along palm-fringed promenades. A baroque campanile chimes. Kids play in piazzas flanked by pastel-coloured mansions. Italian weather. Italian style. And that’s not to mention the Italian gelato, Italian pasta, Italian architecture and Italian language.
The Alps are every bit as magnificent as elsewhere in Switzerland, but here you can admire them while sipping a full-bodied merlot at a pavement cafe, enjoying a hearty lunch at a chestnut-shaded grotto (rustic Ticino-style inn or restaurant), or floating in the mirrorlike lakes of Lugano and Locarno. Ticino tempers its classic Alpine looks with Italian good living.
To the north, the stunning medieval fortress town of Bellinzona keeps watch over valleys speckled with homely hamlets and Romanesque chapels. Rearing above them are wild, forested peaks with endless hiking options past lakes and roaring mountain streams.

History
Ticino, long a poor, rural buffer between the Swiss-German cantons north of the Alps and Italy to the south, was absorbed by the Swiss in the late 15th century after centuries of changing hands between the lords of Como and the dukes of Milan.
The founding cantons of the Swiss Confederation – Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden – defeated a superior Milanese force at Giornico in the Valle Levantina in 1478 and took Bellinzona in 1503, thus securing the confederation’s vulnerable underbelly. In 1803, Ticino entered the new Swiss Confederation, concocted by Napoleon, as a free and equal canton.
With such a small percentage of the Swiss population, the canton counts for little in big national decisions. Wages are lower (as much as 25%) than in most of the rest of Switzerland, and unemployment (at 4.8%) is above the national average (3.2%).
Closer to Milan than Bern, Ticino reveals a dual identity: the Ticinese share the same language, food, art and architecture as neighbouring Italy, yet they appreciate the political and institutional autonomy within the framework of the Federal Constitution that being part of Switzerland affords them.
In February 2014, Ticino made headline news when the Ticinese voted overwhelmingly (68.3%) against the mass immigration of EU workers to Switzerland. This appears to have been fuelled by the sentiment that the cross-border worker situation has spiralled out of control, with many jobs being filled by Italians, which in turn drives down wages and causes ongoing congestion on the roads.
The Gotthard Base Tunnel, the world’s longest at 57km, is set to open in 2017. When it does, the train time from Zurich to Milan will be cut by 1½ hours.
8Information
The website www.ticino.ch gives the low-down on regional events, activities, itineraries, transport, accommodation and food. Numerous brochures can be downloaded online.
Ask about the 29 mountain huts run by the Federazione Alpinistica Ticinese (www.fat-ti.ch) along hiking trails. These and other huts (often unstaffed) are listed at www.capanneti.ch (in Italian and German).
Wine is a big part of the Ticino experience. Log onto www.ticinowine.ch (in Italian and German), which details wineries around the canton.
8Getting There & Around
Ticino’s closest international airport is Milan Malpensa (www.milanomalpensa-airport.com), 89km south of Lugano. The airport is served by British Airways, Flybe, American Airlines, easyJet and other airlines. ​Frequent airport buses make the run to Lugano (Sfr25) and Bellinzona (Sfr40).
The A2 motorway links Como in the south of the canton to the St Gotthard Tunnel in the north; the latter is notorious for traffic jams, so check www.gotthard-strassentunnel.ch before heading out. Helter-skelter pass roads link Ticino to the rest of Switzerland, including the San Bernadino Pass to Graubünden, the St Gotthard Pass to Central Switzerland and the Nufenenpass to Valais.
The canton is crisscrossed with well-marked cycling trails. Bikes can be hired from major train stations. One-day bike hire costs Sfr54 for an e-bike and Sfr35 for a country/mountain bike. For details, see www.rentabike.ch (in German and French).
BELLINZONA
Pop 17,744 / Elev 230m
Placed at the convergence point of several Alpine valleys, Bellinzona is visually striking. Its three grey-stone medieval castles have attracted everyone from Swiss invaders to painter William Turner. Yet Bellinzona keeps a surprisingly low profile considering that its castle trio is one of only 11 Unesco World Heritage sites in Switzerland.
The main castle, Castelgrande, stands upon a rocky central hill, which was a Roman frontier post and Lombard defensive tower, and was later developed as a heavily fortified town controlled by Milan. The three castles and valley walls could not stop the Swiss-German confederate troops from overwhelming the city in 1503, thus deciding Ticino’s fate for the following three centuries.

8Getting There & Away
Bellinzona has frequent train connections to Locarno (Sfr8.20, 29 minutes) and Lugano (Sfr10.20, 30 minutes). It is also on the Zürich–Milan route. Bus 171 runs roughly hourly northeast to Chur (Sfr51, 2¼ hours), departing from beside the train station.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
TICINO’S NORTHERN VALLEYS

North of Bellinzona, the wild and remote Valle di Blenio and Valle Leventina spread out at the foot of piebald peaks forming a natural barrier with Central Switzerland and Graubünden. With their grey-stone villages nestling in chestnut woods and centuries-old grotti (rustic taverns housed in cool, rock-carved cellars), the valleys are an authentic taste of Ticino mountain life.
Trains run twice hourly from Bellinzona to Biasca (Sfr8.20, 14 minutes), the gateway to the Valle di Blenio, with its 13th-century church and grotti serving hearty Ticinese home cooking. From Biasca, the barren-looking valley cuts north to majestic, brooding peaks and the Lukmanier Pass. Footpaths thread through the entire valley and there is modest skiing near the pass. If you’re keen to hit the trail, a great base is Olivone at the base of dagger-shaped Sosto (2221m). Fine hikes also lead up to Lago di Luzzone and the pristine Greina plateau. The website www.blenioturismo.ch (in Italian and German) lists accommodation.
From Biasca, the freeway powers northwest to Airolo in the Valle Leventina and then on to the mighty St Gotthard Pass. High above it is strung a series of mountain hamlets offering superlative views, great walking and the occasional fine feed. Shadowing the railway line, a walking route (www.gottardo-wanderweg.ch) runs from the Reuss valley in Uri (starting at Erstfeld) down the Valle Leventina. At traditional Grotto Val d’Ambra (%091 864 18 29; www.grottovaldambra.ch; mains Sfr15-28; h11am-11pm Tue-Sun Easter-early Oct ) in Personico, try brasato (braised beef) with home-produced wine in the chestnut-shaded garden. Giornico is worth a stop for its two Romanesque bridges, the finest example of a Romanesque church in Ticino (Chiesa di San Nicolao) and the picturesque old centre. At Rodi-Fiesso, the broad valley floor narrows to a claustrophobic gorge and, slightly beyond, is the sleepy valley town of Piotta. Here Europe’s steepest funicular (return adult/child Sfr22/10; h8.30am-6.30pm Jun-late Oct) heads up above the Strada Alta to Lago Ritom, a high dam from where walkers can head into the mountains.
The 2114m St Gotthard Pass lies 7km north of Airolo. You can opt for the 17km tunnel or, when snow doesn’t close it, the mountain road, which climbs in sweeping curves through the bald Alpine terrain. Hikers and mountain bikers love Ospizio San Gottardo (%091 869 12 35; www.passosangottardo.ch; s/d Sfr130/200), a 13th-century guesthouse recently given a contemporary revamp. The hourly train to Airolo from Bellinzona (Sfr16.20, 51 minutes) continues as far as Zürich and passes through the valley towns.
LUGANO
Pop 61,837 / Elev 270m
Ticino’s lush, mountain-rimmed lake isn’t its only liquid asset. The largest city in the canton is also the country’s third-most-important banking centre. Suits aside, Lugano is a vivacious city, with chic boutiques, bars and pavement cafes huddling in the spaghetti maze of steep cobblestone streets that untangle at the edge of the lake and along the flowery promenade.

AIR
Lugano AirportAIRPORT
(%091 610 11 11; www.lugano-airport.ch)
Lugano airport is served by a handful of Swiss-Italian carriers including Swiss and Kissfly.
BUS
The easiest way to reach St Moritz is to take the train to Bellinzona and switch to a postal bus via Thusis (Sfr78, four hours, hourly).
CAR & MOTORCYCLE
You can hire cars at Hertz ( GOOGLE MAP ; %091 923 46 75; www.hertz.ch; Via San Gottardo 13) and Avis ( GOOGLE MAP ; %091 913 41 51; Via Clemente Maraini 14).
TRAIN
Lugano has very frequent train connections to Bellinzona (Sfr10.20, 30 minutes).
8Getting Around
A shuttle bus runs to the airport from Piazza Manzoni (one way/return Sfr10/18) and the train station (one way/return Sfr8/15). See timetables on www.shuttle-bus.com. A taxi to the airport costs around Sfr30.

MARIO BOTTA IN THE PINK

Mario Botta (born 1943 in nearby Mendrisio), one of Switzerland's foremost contemporary architects, has left his indelible mark on Lugano in the form of right angles and shades of pink. His town-centre landmarks include the BSí ( GOOGLE MAP ; Via San Franscini), a series of interconnected monoliths formerly known as the Banca del Gottardo; the pink brick office block known to locals as the Cherry Building ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Via Pretorio 9 ) because of the cherry tree planted on the roof; and the roof of the TPL local bus terminus on Corso Pestalozzi. At night it is illuminated in…light pink.
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
WHAT’S COOKING IN TICINO?

Switzerland meets Italy in Ticino’s kitchen and some of your most satisfying eating experiences in Ticino will happen in grotti – rustic, out-of-the-way restaurants, with granite tables set up under the cool chestnut trees in summer. The trilingual Guida a Grotti e Osterie gives a great overview.
Want to eat like a local? Get stuck into these classic Ticinese specialities.
Polenta Creamy, savoury maize cornmeal dish.
Brasato Beef braised in red wine.
Capretto in umido alla Mesolcinese Tangy kid-meat stew with a touch of cinnamon and cooked in red wine.
Cazzöla A hearty meat casserole served with cabbage and potatoes.
Mazza casalinga A mixed selection of delicatessen cuts.
Cicitt Long, thin sausages made from goat’s meat and often grilled.
Robiola Soft and creamy cow’s-milk cheese that comes in small discs.
WORTH A TRIP
LAKE ESCAPES

For a bird’s-eye view of Lugano and the lake, head for the hills. A funicular from Cassarate (walk or take bus 2 from central Lugano) hauls you up to the summit of Monte Brè (www.montebre.ch; funicular one-way/return Sfr16/25) (925m) from March to December. The peak is the trailhead for hiking and mountain-biking trails that grant expansive views of the lake and reach deep into the Alps.
From Paradiso, the funicular (www.montesansalvatore.ch; funicular one way/return Sfr24/28) to Monte San Salvatore operates from mid-March to early November. Aside from the views, the walk down to Paradiso or Melide is an hour well spent.
A lovely place to stay the night is the Locanda del Giglio (%091 930 09 33; www.locandadelgiglio.ch; Roveredo, Capriasca; dm Sfr35-45, s/d Sfr95/150) in Roveredo, 12km north of Lugano. Backing onto forest, the eco-focused, solar-powered lodge harbours rooms with balconies offering mountain views and even lake glimpses. Take a bus from Lugano train station to Tesserete (Sfr6.20, 30 minutes) and change for another to Roveredo (Sfr4.20, 12 minutes).
LAGO DI LUGANO
Much of the lake can be seen in one day if you don’t fancy a longer excursion. Boats are operated by the Società Navigazione del Lago di Lugano (%091 971 52 23; www.lakelugano.ch). Examples of return fares from Lugano are Melide (Sfr27.40), Morcote (Sfr38) and Ponte Tresa (Sfr45.60). If you want to visit several places, buy a pass: one, three or seven days costs Sfr49, Sfr59 or Sfr76 respectively. There are reduced fares for children.
The departure point from Lugano is by Piazza della Riforma. Boats sail year-round, but the service is more frequent from late March to late October.

Gandria
Gandria is an attractive, compact village almost dipping into the water. A popular trip is to take the boat from Lugano and walk back along the shore to Castagnola (around 40 minutes), where you can visit Villa Heleneum and Villa Favorita, or simply continue back to Lugano by foot.
Across the lake from Gandria is the Museo delle Dogane Svizzere (Swiss Customs Museum; www.zollmuseum.ch; h1.30-5.30pm Apr–mid-Oct), accessible by boat. It tells the history of customs (and, more interestingly, smuggling) in this border area. On display are confiscated smugglers’ boats that once operated on the lake.
Campione d’Italia
It’s hard to tell but this really is part of Italy surrounded by Switzerland. There are no border formalities (but take your passport anyway), many cars in the village have Swiss number plates, and the area uses Swiss telephones and Swiss francs.
The 12-storey casino ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.casinocampione.it; h11.30am-5am Mon-Thu, 11.30am-6am Fri, 10.30am-6pm Sat, 10.30am-5pm Sun) was converted by Ticinese star architect Mario Botta into one of Europe’s most architecturally striking casinos in 2005. Smart dress is required. From noon to midnight you can take bus 439 from Lugano’s Piazza Manzoni (Sfr6.20, 15 minutes) to Campione d’Italia.
Monte Generoso
From this 1701m summit you can survey lakes, Alps and the Apennines on a clear day. Monte Generoso can be reached by boat (except in winter). Alternatively, when the new hotel and restaurant open at the summit in 2016, the rack-and-pinion train will once again run from Capolago.
Ceresio Peninsula
South of Lugano, this peninsula is created by the looping shoreline of Lago di Lugano. Walking trails dissect the interior and small villages dot the lakeside. The postal bus from Lugano to Morcote goes via either Melide or Figino, and departs approximately hourly. Year-round boats also connect Morcote and Melide to Lugano.
Montagnola
German novelist Hermann Hesse (1877–1962) chose to live in this small town in 1919 after the horrors of WWI had separated him from his family. He wrote some of his greatest works here, at first in an apartment in Casa Camuzzi. Nearby, in Torre Camuzzi, is the Museo Hermann Hesse (www.hessemontagnola.ch; Torre Camuzzi, Montagnola; adult/reduced Sfr8.50/7; h10am-5.30pm Tue-Sun Mar-Oct, 10.30am-5.30pm Sat & Sun Nov-Feb), which showcases personal objects, including some of the thousands of watercolours he painted in Ticino, books, and other odds and ends that help re-create something of his life. From Lugano, get the Ferrovia Ponte Tresa train to Sorengo and change for a postal bus to Montagnola (Sfr4.20, 17 minutes).
Melide
Melide is a bulge of shore from which the A2 freeway slices across the lake. The main attraction is Swissminiatur (www.swissminiatur.ch; Via Cantonale; adult/child Sfr19/12; h9am-6pm mid-Mar–Oct), where you’ll find 1:25 scale models of more than 120 national attractions. It’s the quick way to see Switzerland in a day.
Trains run twice hourly to Lugano (Sfr4.20, eight minutes).
Morcote
With its narrow cobbled lanes, endless nooks and crannies and dazzling lake and mountain views, this former fishing village (population 729) huddling below Monte Abostora is a delight to explore on foot.
Set in subtropical parkland, Parco Scherrer (adult/child Sfr7/2; h10am-5pm Mar-Jun, Sep & Oct, 10am-6pm Jul-Aug), 400m west of the boat stop, offers a bustling range of architectural styles, including copies of famous buildings and generic types (eg Temple of Nefertiti, Siamese teahouse).
About 5km further is Carona, where footpaths thread through Parco Botanico San Grato , hilltop botanic gardens that afford sensational lake and mountain views. In May, the park is ablaze with the colour of azaleas and rhododendrons in bloom.
There are several lakeside sleeping options. Albergo della Posta (%091 996 11 27; www.hotelmorcote.com; Piazza Grande; s Sfr95-135, d Sfr120-190; W) has charming little rooms with wooden floors; most also have views across the lake. It has its own restaurant.
The walk along the shore to Melide takes around 50 minutes.
Mendrisio & Around
Pop 14,499 / Elev 354m
Sidling up to Italy, this southern corner of Ticino – easily explored by bicycle – is sprinkled with vineyards and quaint villages crowned by Italianate baroque churches. Mendrisio is the district capital and has a useful tourist office (%091 641 30 50; www.mendrisiotourism.ch; Via Luigi Lavizzari 2; h9am-noon Mon-Fri, 2-6pm Sat), near the central Piazza alla Valle. The town springs to life for the Maundy Thursday Procession and the Wine Harvest in September, where you can sample the region’s best merlot.
Housed in a restored 17th-century palazzo, Atenaeo del Vino (%091 630 06 36; www.atenaeodelvino.ch; Via Pontico Virunio 1; mains Sfr36-42; h10am-2.30pm & 5-11pm Mon-Sat) matches seasonal fare (think asparagus, mushrooms, seafood, game) with top regional wines drawn from its cavernous cellar. The ambience is relaxed and homely.
Trains run to Mendrisio from Lugano (Sfr8.20, 20 minutes).
Exiting southeast from Mendrisio, a side road leads about 15km uphill and north along the Valle di Muggio. The valley is famous for its Zincarlin, a pungent soft cheese made from raw cow or goat milk, which is rolled by hand and aged with salt and white wine. This pretty drive ends abruptly in the hamlet of Roncapiano, where a 2½-hour hike to Monte Generoso begins.
Meride
Pop 314 / Elev 583m
The Museo dei Fossili (Fossil Museum; www.montesangiorgio.ch; Via Bernardo Peyer 9, Meride; adult/child Sfr12/6; h9am-5pm Tue-Sun) in Meride displays vestiges of the first creatures to inhabit the region – reptiles and fish dating back more than 200 million years. It may sound dry but the finds are important enough to warrant Unesco recognition of the area around Monte San Giorgio (where they were uncovered) as a World Heritage site.
Near the town is a circular nature trail. Postal buses run frequently between Meride and Mendrisio (Sfr4.20, 25 minutes), with onward train connections to Lugano.
LAGO MAGGIORE
Only the northeast corner of Lago Maggiore is in Switzerland; the rest slices into Italy’s Lombardy region. Navigazione Lago Maggiore (www.navigazionelaghi.it) operates boats across the entire lake. Limited day passes cost Sfr20.70, but the Sfr36.60 version is valid for the entire Swiss basin. There are various options for visiting the Italian side.

Locarno
Pop 15,483 / Elev 205m
With its palm trees and much-vaunted 2300 hours of sunshine a year, Locarno has attracted pasty northerners to its warm, Mediterranean-style setting since the late 19th century. The lowest town in Switzerland, it seemed like a soothing spot to host the 1925 peace conference intended to bring stability to Europe after WWI. Long before, the Romans appreciated its strategic position on the lake and Maggia river.

oSantuario della Madonna del SassoCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h6.30am-6.30pm)F
Overlooking the town, this sanctuary was built after the Virgin Mary supposedly appeared in a vision to a monk, Bartolomeo d’Ivrea, in 1480. There’s a highly adorned church and several rather rough, near-life-size statue groups (including one of the Last Supper) in niches on the stairway. The best-known painting in the church is La Fuga in Egitto (Flight to Egypt), painted in 1522 by Bramantino.
A funicular ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult one way/return Sfr4.80/7.20, child Sfr2.20/3.60; h8am-10pm) runs every 15 minutes from the town centre past the sanctuary to Orselina, but a more scenic, pilgrim-style approach is the 20-minute walk up the chapel-lined Via Crucis (take Via al Sasso off Via Cappuccini).

WORTH A TRIP
VAL VERZASCA

About 4km northeast of Locarno, this rugged 26km valley snakes north past the impressive dam, which is fed by the gushing, startlingly emerald Verzasca river.
Just beyond the 220m-high Verzasca Dam (Europe’s highest), look to the left and you will see Switzerland’s smallest hamlet, Corippo (population 15), a cluster of granite-built, slate-roofed houses seemingly pasted on to the thickly wooded mountain flank. To reach it you cross the Gola Verzasca, a delightful little gorge.
About 5km upstream, Lavertezzo is known for its narrow, double-humped, Romanesque bridge and the natural pools in the icy stream. Be careful, as storms upstream can turn the river into a raging torrent. Stay at riverside Osteria Vittoria (%091 746 15 81; www.osteriavittoria.ch; Lavertezzo, Valle Verzasca; d Sfr120-140), a bustling family lodge with its own restaurant and garden. Most rooms have balconies with views over the Verzasca.
Another 12km takes you to Sonogno, a once-abandoned hamlet at the head of the valley, enveloped by chestnut and beech woods.
The two-day, 34km Sentiero Verzasca trail takes in all of the above highlights; visit http://wanderland.myswitzerland.com for route maps and details. Bouldering and climbing pros are in their element in this rocky valley.
For more of a thrill still, you could bungee jump from the top of the dam. The experience is five seconds of pure heart-stopping, mind-bending adrenalin. The big jump can be made on weekends between Easter and October for Sfr255. Local bungee experts include Trekking Outdoor Team (%091 780 78 00; www.trekking.ch) and Swissraft. Both companies arrange other active pursuits, including canyoning, climbing, rafting, canoeing, paragliding and skydiving.
Postal buses operate to Sonogno from Locarno as often as once hourly (Sfr10.20, 1¼ hours).

2Walking Tour
Cima della Trosa

START CARDADA, LOCARNO
FINISH MERGOSCIA
LENGTH 10KM; 3¾ TO FIVE HOURS
This high-level route traverses the rounded mountaintops, affording eagle’s-eye perspectives of Lago Maggiore and Alpine peaks, and passing centuries-old hamlets and villages only accessible on foot. The most detailed map is Orell Füssli’s 1:25,000 Locarno/Ascona (Sfr30).
From the upper cable-car station at 1Cardada, head right, climbing around the open slopes to reach the rustic stone hut of 2Capanna Lo Stallone in the grassy hollow of Alpe Cardada (1486m), after 30 to 40 minutes. The track cuts back left over the bracken-covered mountainsides, then swings right to skirt the forest and arrive at 1671m 3Capanna Cimetta.
Below the upper chairlift station, the left-hand path descends quickly to a saddle (1610m) with a springwater fountain. Make a rising traverse of the southwestern slopes of 4Cima della Trosa. A short side trail brings you to the cross mounted on the windswept 1869m summit after a further 35 to 45 minutes.
The path soon winds down Cima della Trosa’s northeastern flank to a minor col (1657m). From here a side trip to the often snow-dusted peak of 5Madone (2039m) takes 1½ to two hours; the straightforward route follows the ridge, with some harmless rock-scrambling and arresting views higher up.
Descend in broad zigzags to 6Alpe di Bietri (1499m), stopping for creamy goat’s cheese made at the dairy, then continuing on an old mule trail tracing the northern slopes of Valle di Mergoscia. The route descends gently past dilapidated houses and rustic hamlets to reach 7Bresciadiga (1128m), 1¼ to 1¾ hours from Cima della Trosa.
Bear right at a junction, leading past small shrines before coming into a car park. Stroll 600m downhill to intersect with the main road, then follow the sealed road left up steep, vine-clad hillsides to arrive at the square beside the large baroque church of postcard-pretty 8Mergoscia, sitting high above the Val Verzasca, after a final one-to-1¼-hour leg. From Mergoscia, bus 312 runs every two hours back to Locarno (Sfr6.20, 37 minutes).
TICINO DISCOVERY CARD

Save with the three-day Ticino Discovery Card (Sfr87/69 with/without public transport), which includes a return cable-car ride from Orselina to Cimetta, entry to the lido, a day ticket for boat trips on the Swiss side of Lago Maggiore and entry to the botanic gardens on Isole di Brissago. It’s available at tourist offices in Locarno and Ascona from mid-March to early November.
WESTERN VALLEYS
The valleys that reach north and west of Locarno paint an idyllic rustic picture with their little clusters of stone houses with heavy slate roofs, burbling mountain streams and inviting grotti.
Centovalli
The ‘hundred valleys’ is the westward valley route to Domodossola in Italy, known on the Italian side as Val Vigezzo. As you head west of Ponte Brolla, 4km west of Locarno, the road winds out in a string of tight curves, high on the north flank of the Melezzo stream, which is largely held in check by a dam.
Grey stone villages clinging to the hillsides, such as Verdasio, Rasa and Bordei, make serene bases for mountain hikes. Reached by a cable car from Verdasio or a lovely 8km hike through beech and chestnut woods, the ecofriendly B&B Alla Capanna (%091 798 18 04; www.montecomino.ch; Monte Comino, Intragna; r per person with/without half board Sfr75/50; W) in Intragna is a welcome respite. Its dorms and doubles are simple and pine furnished, the mountain views are sublime, and the restaurant uses local produce to rustle up regional favourites such as slow-cooked meats and polenta.
Re, on the Italian side, sees a procession of pilgrims on 30 April each year, a tradition that originated when a painting of the Madonna was reported to have started bleeding when struck by a ball in 1480. The bulbous basilica was built in the name of the Madonna del Sangue (Madonna of the Blood) between 1922 and 1950.
To see the valley in beautiful slow motion, hop aboard the panoramic Centovalli Railway (www.centovalli.ch; one-way adult/child Sfr35/17.50). Departing from Locarno for Domodossola (1¾ hours, 11 daily), the train trundles across 83 bridges and burrows through 34 tunnels, offering superlative views of waterfalls, vineyards, craggy mountains and chestnut forests.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
VALLE ONSERNONE

For total peace and big wilderness, make a detour to Valle Onsernone, just north of Centovalli. Once known for its granite mines, this silent, little-known valley is dotted with clusters of stone houses forming attractive hamlets.
Spruga is a popular starting point for high-Alpine hikes and walks. The main road curves further north to Vergeletto, quiet except for the roar of the mountain stream past its houses and church. The road peters out 6km west and the territory is great for hiking.
To fully appreciate the valley when it's blanketed in morning silence, Da Toldo (%091 780 60 56; www.datoldo.ch; Russo; s Sfr70-80, d Sfr120-140, half board per person Sfr30; pW) in Russo makes a fine base. Immersed in greenery, this restored Ticinese house shelters three colourful, wood-floored rooms, which are incredibly homely.
Make the excursion to nearby Gresso, a close-knit hamlet scenically perched at 999m, where you may find a lone osteria open for lunch.
Up to five daily buses run from Locarno to Spruga (Sfr10.20, 1¼ hours). Change at Russo for Vergeletto and Gresso.
Valle Maggia
Nature has certainly worked its maggia (magic) in this broad, sunny valley, where 3000m peaks tower above cascading waterfalls, and granite villages cling to steep hillsides. The Maggia river twists through the valley until it splits at the main town, Cevio, the first of several divisions into smaller valleys.
1Sights & Activities
Some 700km of hiking trails crisscross the valley, and there’s abundant craggy terrain for mountain and downhill bikers; see www.vallemaggia.ch for routes and maps. Imposing crags attract experienced climbers in Ponte Brolla, Val Bavona and Bosco Gurin.
Bosco GurinVILLAGE
A road of seemingly endless hairpin bends snakes up to this minor ski centre (with 30km of pistes) and high-pasture village of slate-roofed, white-washed houses. It is the only village in Ticino where the main language is German, a result of Valais immigrants. This heritage is spelled out in artefacts at the stone-and-wood Walserhaus (www.walserhaus.ch; adult/child Sfr5/1; h10-11.30am Tue-Sat & 1.30-5pm Tue-Sun Apr-Oct).
CevioVILLAGE
The centrepiece of Cevio is its vibrant 16th-century Pretorio (magistrate’s court), covered in the family coats-of-arms of many of the area’s rulers, mostly from the 17th century. About 1km away, the core of the Old Town is graced with 16th-century mansions. A short walk away (signposted) are grotti, cellars carved out of great blocks of granite that tumbled onto the town here in a landslide.
FusioVILLAGE
This pretty village sits surrounded by woods at the head of Val Lavizzara. From here the road leads to the dam holding back the emerald Lago Sambuco, from where you can hike to other lakes as well as north over the mountains into Valle Leventina.
Valle di CampoVALLEY
A winding forest road brings you to this broad, sunny, upland valley. The prettiest of its towns is Campo, with scattered houses and Romanesque belltower. The valley is closed off by Cimalmotto, which offers rugged mountain views.
Val BavonaVALLEY
A smooth road follows a mountain stream through this valley, where narrow meadows are cradled between steep rocky walls. Its series of tightly huddled stone and slate-roofed hamlets are irresistible. The impossibly pretty grey-stone hamlet of Foroglio is dominated by the wispy spray of its 100m waterfall (a 10-minute walk away).
At the end of the valley, just after San Carlo, a cable car rides up to Robiei dam (www.robiei.ch; cable car one-way/rtn Sfr19/24) and its startlingly turquoise reservoir, tailor-made for a day’s mountain hiking.
Chiesa di San Giovanni BattistaCHURCH
The centrepiece of Mogno is this extraordinary 1996 cylindrical church designed by Mario Botta. The grey (Maggia granite) and white (marble from Peccia) interior doorway has a strangely neo-Romanesque air to it.
Via AltaWALKING
This challenging 52km, six-day hike is one of the region’s showcase walks, leading from Locarno to Fusio (or vice versa) through the Valle Maggia and Val Verzasca. Following old mule and goat trails, the hike takes you to jewel-coloured lakes, mountain refuges and high Alpine peaks, including 3071m Campo Tencia.
AvegnoSWIMMING
If you’re tempted to take a dip in the glacially cold Maggia river, Avegno’s sandy beaches and natural rock pools are the place to do it.
