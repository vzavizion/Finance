Central Switzerland


To the Swiss, Central Switzerland – green, mountainous and soothingly beautiful – is the very essence of ‘Swissness’. It was here that the pact that kick-started a nation was signed in 1291; here that hero William Tell gave a rebel yell against Habsburg rule. Geographically, politically, spiritually, this is the heartland. Nowhere does the flag fly higher.
You can see why locals swell with pride at Lake Lucerne: enigmatic in the cold mist of morning, molten gold in the dusky half-light.
The dreamy city of Lucerne is small enough for old-world charm yet big enough to harbour designer hotels and a world-class gallery full of Picassos. From here, cruise to resorts like Weggis and Brunnen, or hike Mt Pilatus and Mt Rigi. Northeast of Lucerne, Zug has Kirschtorte (cherry cake) as rich as its residents and medieval heritage. Come snow-time, head to the Alps for Andermatt’s austere mountain-scapes or Engelberg for powdery off-piste perfection.
When to Go
Any time is a good time to visit Lucerne, although it does get packed in the summer months and during the Lucerne Festival. For places such as Andermatt and Engelberg, winter is the obvious time for taking advantage of skiing and snowboarding opportunities, although late spring, summer and early autumn are wonderful for walking and hiking. Zug and Lake Uri are at their best in summer, when swimming in the lakes is heavenly.

8Getting There & Around
The nearest major airport is Zürich, and road and rail connections are excellent in all directions. An interesting way to leave the region is aboard the Wilhelm Tell Express (www.swisstravelsystem.com/en/wilhelm-tell-express.html).
If you don’t have a Swiss or Eurail Pass (both of which are valid on lake journeys), consider purchasing the regional Tell-Pass (www.tell-pass.ch; adult per 2/3/4/5/10 days Sfr170/200/220/230/280, child up to 10 days Chf30), which is valid from April through October. Sold at the Lucerne tourist office and all boat stations, the Tell-Pass provides unlimited travel region-wide on trains, boats, buses, cable cars and mountain railways for two to 10 days.

Lucerne
Pop 79,478 / Elev 435m
Recipe for a gorgeous Swiss city: take a cobalt lake ringed by mountains of myth, add a well-preserved medieval Altstadt (Old Town) and a reputation for making beautiful music, then sprinkle with covered bridges, sunny plazas, candy-coloured houses and waterfront promenades. Lucerne is stunning, and deservedly popular since the likes of Goethe, Queen Victoria and Wagner savoured her views in the 19th century. Legend has it that an angel with a light showed the first settlers where to build a chapel in Lucerne, and today it still has amazing grace.
One minute it’s nostalgic (its emotive lion sculpture, its fondness for tradition), the next highbrow, with concerts at acoustic marvel KKL (Kultur und Kongresszentrum) and the Sammlung Rosengart’s peerless Picasso collection. Though the shops are still crammed with what Mark Twain so eloquently described as ‘gimcrackery of the souvenir sort’, Lucerne doesn’t only dwell on the past, with a roster of music gigs keeping the vibe upbeat. Carnival capers at Fasnacht, balmy summers, golden autumns – this ‘city of lights’ shines in every season.

The two-day Lucerne Museum Card (www.luzern.com/en/museum-card; 2-day card Sfr36) can save you money if you plan to visit multiple museums.
oKapellbrückeBRIDGE
(Chapel Bridge MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Chapel Bridge)
You haven’t really been to Lucerne until you have strolled the creaky 14th-century Kapellbrücke, spanning the Reuss River in the Old Town. The octagonal water tower is original, but its gabled roof is a modern reconstruction, rebuilt after a disastrous fire in 1993. As you cross the bridge, note Heinrich Wägmann’s 17th-century triangular roof panels, showing important events from Swiss history and mythology. The icon is at its most photogenic when bathed in soft golden light at dusk.
oLion MonumentMONUMENT
(Löwendenkmal; GOOGLE MAP ; Denkmalstrasse)
By far the most touching of the 19th-century sights that lured so many British to Lucerne is the Lion Monument. Lukas Ahorn carved this 10m-long sculpture of a dying lion into the rock face in 1820 to commemorate Swiss soldiers who died defending King Louis XVI during the French Revolution. Mark Twain once called it the ‘saddest and most moving piece of rock in the world’. For Narnia fans, it often evokes Aslan at the stone table.
SpreuerbrückeBRIDGE
(Spreuer Bridge; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; btwn Kasernenplatz & Mühlenplatz)
Downriver from Kapellbrücke, this 1408 structure is darker and smaller but entirely original. Lore has it that this was the only bridge where Lucerne's medieval villagers were allowed to throw Spreu (chaff) into the river. Here, the roof panels consist of artist Caspar Meglinger’s movie-storyboard-style sequence of paintings, The Dance of Death, showing how the plague affected all levels of society.
MuseggmauerFORTRESS
(City Wall; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h8am-7pm Apr-Oct)F
For a bird’s-eye view over Lucerne’s rooftops to the glittering lake and mountains beyond, wander the medieval ramparts. A walkway is open between the Schirmerturm ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) (tower), where you enter, and the Wachturm ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), from where you have to retrace your steps. You can also ascend and descend the Zytturm ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) or Männliturm ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) (the latter is not connected to the ramparts walkway).
VerkehrshausMUSEUM
(Swiss Museum of Transport; GOOGLE MAP ; %041 370 44 44; www.verkehrshaus.ch; Lidostrasse 5; adult/child Sfr30/15; h10am-6pm Apr-Oct, to 5pm Nov-Mar; c)
A great kid-pleaser, the fascinating interactive Verkehrshaus is deservedly Switzerland’s most popular museum. Alongside space rockets, steam locomotives, bicycles and dugout canoes are hands-on activities such as flight simulators and broadcasting studios.
The museum also shelters a planetarium ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child Sfr15/9), Switzerland's largest 3D cinema ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.filmtheater.ch; adult/child daytime Sfr18/14, evening Sfr22/19), and its newest attraction: the Swiss Chocolate Experience (adult/child Sfr15/9), a 20-minute ride that whirls visitors through multimedia exhibits on the origins, history, production and distribution of chocolate, from Ghana to Switzerland and beyond.
Take bus 6, 8 or 24 to the Verkehrshaus stop.
Kultur und KongresszentrumARTS CENTRE
(KKL; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %tour reservations 041 226 79 50; www.kkl-luzern.ch; Europaplatz; guided tour adult/child Sfr15/9)
French architect Jean Nouvel’s waterfront arts and convention centre is a postmodern jawdropper in an otherwise historic city. Inside, the tall, narrow concert hall, partly built below the lake’s surface, is surrounded by a reverberation chamber and has an adjustable suspended ceiling, all creating a bubble of silence that results in near perfect acoustics. Countless accolades showered upon the hall have raised the profile of the tripartite Lucerne Music Festival, increasingly one of the highlights on the global music calendar.
KunstmuseumMUSEUM
(Museum of Art; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %041 226 78 00; www.kunstmuseumluzern.ch; Level K, Europaplatz 1; adult/child Sfr15/6; h10am-5pm Tue & Thu-Sun, to 8pm Wed)
At this art museum inside the Kultur und Kongresszentrum, the permanent collection garners mixed reviews, but keep an eye out for great temporary exhibitions.
Bourbaki PanoramaLANDMARK
( GOOGLE MAP ; %041 412 30 30; www.bourbakipanorama.ch; Löwenplatz 11; adult/child Sfr12/7; h9am-6pm Apr-Oct, 10am-5pm Nov-Mar)
Edouard Castres’ painstakingly detailed 1100-sq-metre circular painting depicting the internment of French troops in Switzerland after the Franco–Prussian War of 1870–71 is accompanied by a moving narrative (with written translation in English).
GletschergartenLANDMARK
(Glacier Garden; GOOGLE MAP ; %041 410 43 40; www.gletschergarten.ch; Denkmalstrasse 4; adult/child Sfr15/8; h9am-6pm Apr-Oct, 10am-5pm Nov-Mar; c)
The Gletschergarten houses a strip of rock bearing the scars (including huge potholes) inflicted on it by the glacier that slid over it some 20 million years ago. Kids of all ages and devotees of kitsch will love getting lost in the Thousand and One Nights–style mirror maze inspired by Spain’s Alhambra Palace.
Historisches MuseumMUSEUM
(History Museum; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %041 228 54 24; www.historischesmuseum.lu.ch; Pfistergasse 24; adult/child Sfr10/5; h10am-5pm Tue-Sun)
Lucerne's history museum is cleverly organised into a series of attention-grabbing themed sections, each interpreted in German or English with the help of a barcode-reading audio guide.
Natur-MuseumMUSEUM
(Nature Museum; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %041 228 54 11; www.naturmuseum.ch; Kasernenplatz 6; adult/child Sfr8/3; h10am-5pm Tue-Sun)
At this hands-on museum full of stuffed critters and creepy crawlies, highlights include a woodland trail with real trees, plus the fabled Luzerner Drachenstein (Lucerne Dragon Stone), which legendarily fell from a dragon’s mouth as it was flying over Mt Pilatus. (Modern science suggests that the 15th-century stone was probably a meteorite.)
Richard Wagner MuseumMUSEUM
( GOOGLE MAP ; %041 360 23 70; www.richard-wagner-museum.ch; Richard-Wagner-Weg 27; adult/child Sfr8/free; h10am-noon & 2-5pm Tue-Sun mid-Mar–Nov)
Housed in the composer’s former residence in Tribschen, on the lake’s southern shore, this museum harbours historic musical instruments including rarities such as a regal (portable organ). Take bus 6, 7 or 8 from the train station to Wartegg.
SAMMLUNG ROSENGART

Lucerne’s blockbuster cultural attraction is the Sammlung Rosengart. Occupying a graceful neoclassical building, it showcases the outstanding collection of Angela Rosengart, a Swiss art dealer and close friend of Picasso who, in an act of great civic generosity, made some 200-odd works available to the public. Alongside works by the great Spanish master are paintings and sketches by Klee, Cézanne, Kandinsky, Miró, Matisse and Monet, including the first item ever bought by Rosengart, Swiss artist Paul Klee’s childlike X-chen (1938).
Complementing this collection are some 200 photographs by David Douglas Duncan of the last 17 years of Picasso’s life with his family in their home near Cannes, France. It’s a uniquely revealing series that portrays the artist in his roles as an impish craftsman, lover, friend and father.
2Activities

zFestivals & Events
Lucerne FestivalMUSIC
(%info 041 226 44 00, tickets 041 226 44 80; www.lucernefestival.ch)
This world-class music festival is divided into three separate seasons: Easter, summer and ‘at the Piano’ (in November). Concerts take place in the KKL and around town.
FASNACHT FEVER

Next time someone grumbles about the Swiss being so irritatingly orderly and well behaved, send them to Lucerne for Fasnacht – they’ll never use those tired clichés again. More boisterous than Basel or Bern, this six-day pre-Lenten bash is stark raving bonkers. The fun kicks off on ‘Dirty Thursday’ with the character Fritschi greeting the crowds from the town hall and a cannon signalling that hedonistic misrule can begin. Warty witches, leering ogres, jangling jesters, it doesn’t matter which costume or mask you choose – dress up, drink and dance, it’s tradition! Guggenmusik bands (literally) rock the bridges, acrobats and actors perform, and parades fill the streets with colour, chaos and ear-splitting music in the build up to Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday).

8Getting There & Away
Frequent trains connect Lucerne to Interlaken Ost (Sfr31, 1¾ hours), Bern (Sfr37, one hour), Lugano (Sfr58, 2½ hours) and Zürich (Sfr24, 45 to 55 minutes).
The A2 freeway connecting Basel and Lugano passes by Lucerne, while the A14/A4 provides the road link to Zürich.
Lake Lucerne boat trips depart from the quays around Bahnhofplatz and Europaplatz.
8Getting Around
Walking is a delight in the largely pedestrianised Old Town. For points further afield, catch city buses outside the Hauptbahnhof at Bahnhofplatz. Tickets cost Sfr2.40 for a short journey (up to six stops), Sfr3.20 for one zone and Sfr4.50 for two. Ticket dispensers indicate the correct fare for each destination. A zone 101 day ticket (Sfr6.40) covers the city centre and beyond; Swiss Pass holders travel free. There’s an underground car park at the train station.
ENTLEBUCH

Located southwest of Lucerne, the 39,000-plus-sq-km Entlebuch area (www.biosphaere.ch; a mixed mountain and highland ecosystem) was declared a Unesco Biosphere Reserve in 2001. Far from being a lonely wilderness outpost, the reserve is home to some 17,000 people keen to preserve their traditional dairy farming lifestyle. The landscape of karst formations, sprawling moors (some 25% of the area), Alpine pastures and mountain streams, which rises from 600m to some 2350m above sea level, makes for some wonderful hiking opportunities. For details pop into the park office (%041 485 88 50; zentrum@biosphaere.ch; Chlosterbüel 28; h8am-noon & 1.30-5pm Mon-Fri) in Schüpfheim, 30 to 45 minutes by train from Lucerne.
Lake Lucerne
Majestic peaks hunch conspiratorially around Vierwaldstättersee – which twists and turns as much as the tongue does when pronouncing it. Little wonder English speakers use the shorthand Lake Lucerne!
To appreciate the views, ride up to Mt Pilatus, Mt Rigi or Stanserhorn. When the clouds peel away or you break through them, precipitous lookout points reveal a crumpled tapestry of green hillsides and shimmering cobalt waters below, with glaciated peaks beyond.
Apart from its mountain viewpoints, the lake offers tucked-away resorts, all accessible by boat. The far eastern reach of Lake Lucerne – Lake Uri or Urnersee – is home to the Rütli Meadow, where the country was legendarily born.

8Getting Around
Boats operated by SGV (www.lakelucerne.ch), including some paddle-steamers, criss-cross Lake Lucerne daily throughout the year. Longer trips are relatively cheaper than short ones, and you can alight as often as you want.
From Lucerne, destinations include Alpnachstad (one-way/return Sfr27/45, 1¾ hours), Weggis (one-way/return Sfr19.60/38, 50 minutes), Vitznau (one-way/return Sfr27/45, 1¼ hours), Brunnen (one-way/return Sfr39/63, 1¾ hours) and Flüelen (one-way/return Sfr46/72, 3¼ hours).
An SGV day ticket costs Sfr72 for adults and Sfr36 for children. Swiss and Eurail passes are valid on scheduled boat trips, while InterRail entitles you to half-price tickets. Passes will also get you discounts on selected mountain railways and cable cars.
Roads closely follow Lake Lucerne's shoreline most of the way around – excluding the stretch from Flüelen to Stansstad. Here, the A2 freeway ploughs a fairly straight line, sometimes underground and usually away from the water.
Mt Pilatus
Rearing above Lucerne from the southwest, Mt Pilatus (www.pilatus.ch) rose to fame in the 19th century when Wagner waxed lyrical about its Alpine vistas and Queen Victoria trotted up here on horseback. Legend has it that this 2132m peak was named after Pontius Pilate, whose corpse was thrown into a lake on its summit and whose restless ghost has haunted its heights ever since. Poltergeists aside, it’s more likely that the moniker derives from the Latin word pileatus, meaning cloud covered – as the mountain frequently is.
From May to October, you can reach Mt Pilatus on a classic ‘golden round-trip’. Board a boat from Lucerne to Alpnachstad, then rise with the world’s steepest cog railway to Mt Pilatus. From the summit, cable cars bring you down to Kriens via Fräkmüntegg and Krienseregg, where bus 1 takes you back to Lucerne. The reverse route (Kriens–Pilatus–Alpnachstad–Lucerne) is also possible. The return trip costs Sfr97 (less with valid Swiss, Eurail or InterRail passes).
For an above-the-treetops adventure in summer, head for Pilatus Seilpark (Rope Park; www.pilatus-seilpark.ch; adult/child Sfr27/20; h10am-5pm mid-Apr-mid-Oct) in Fräkmüntegg, where 11 head-spinning trails from high-wire bridges to tree climbs are graded according to difficulty. Fräkmüntegg is also the starting point for Switzerland’s longest summer toboggan run (adult/child Sfr8/6; h10am-5pm May-mid-Oct), a speedy 1.35km downhill ride.
Mt Pilatus is fantastic for walking. Hikes include a steep, partially roped 2.8km scramble (June to September) from Fräkmüntegg to the summit, an easy 3.5km walk through forest and moor from Krienseregg to Fräkmüntegg, and the 1.5km trudge from Pilatus-Kulm to Tomlishorn, affording views that stretch as far as the Black Forest on a clear day. Climbers can tackle the dizzying Galtigentürme rock pillars or Holzwangflue’s gullies where ibex often roam.
In winter, try sledging 6km through snowy woodlands from Fräkmüntegg to Kriens. A return ticket between Kriens and Fräkmüntegg by cable car costs Sfr40 for adults and Sfr20 for children. Free sledge hire is available at Fräkmüntegg station.
If you fancy staying overnight, the recently renovated 19th-century Pilatus-Kulm (%041 329 12 12; www.pilatus.ch/en/hotel-pilatus-kulm; Mt Pilatus; s Sfr245-285, d Sfr340-390, ste Sfr410-480, all incl breakfast & dinner ) offers a swanky mountain-top sleeping experience, with four-course dinner and buffet breakfast included in the price. Discounts are offered in low season.
Stanserhorn
Looming above the lake, 1898m Stanserhorn (www.stanserhorn.ch) boasts 360-degree vistas of Lake Lucerne, Mts Titlis and Pilatus and other surrounding mountains. Getting to the summit is half the fun. The journey starts with a ride on a vintage 19th-century funicular from Stans to Kälti; from here, the nearly transparent CabriO, launched in 2012 as the world's first cable car with an open upper deck, takes you the rest of the way, offering amazing on-the-go views.
The funicular’s base station is a five-minute walk from Stans train station. At the summit, CabriO employees distribute time-specific boarding passes for the return trip. Request your desired return time upon arrival; otherwise, you may spend more time up top than you bargained for!
At the summit you'll find the star-shaped Rondorama, the region’s only revolving restaurant, which rotates 360° every 43 minutes. Kids love the nearby marmot park, where the whistling critters can be observed in a near natural habitat.
Stans is on the Lucerne–Engelberg railway (one-way from Lucerne Sfr9, 20 minutes). Dorfplatz, Stans' central square, is located behind the station, overlooked by an early baroque church and the well-regarded Hotel Engel (%041 619 10 10; www.engelstans.ch; Dorfplatz 1; s/d from Sfr100/150; piW), which hides streamlined rooms behind its historic facade.
Klewenalp
Up the slopes from Lake Lucerne's southern shore, Klewenalp is an underrated skiing destination with 40km of well-prepared red and blue runs, which become hiking, climbing and mountain biking trails in summer.
To get here, head first for Beckenried, accessible by bus from Stans (Sfr6.70, 25 minutes) or boat from Lucerne (Sfr30, 1¼ hours). Upon disembarking at Beckenried's bus stop/boat dock, walk 200m to the cable car that whisks you up the mountain to Klewenalp (one-way/return Sfr24/38, 10 minutes). A trail map at the top outlines your options.
Mt Rigi
Blue... no, red!... no, dark!… Turner couldn’t quite make up his mind about how he preferred 1797m Mt Rigi (www.rigi.ch) so in 1842 the genius painted the mountain in three different lights to reflect its changing moods. On a clear day, there are impressive views to a jagged spine of peaks including Mt Titlis and the Jungfrau giants. To the north and west, you overlook Arth-Goldau and Zugersee, which curves around until it almost joins Küssnacht and an arm of Lake Lucerne. Sunrises and sunsets viewed from Rigi's summit are the stuff of bucket lists.
Two rival railways carry passengers to the top (one-way/return Sfr42/68). One runs from Arth-Goldau (45 minutes), the other from Vitznau (30 minutes). The Vitznau route offers the option of diverting at Rigi Kaltbad on the return trip and taking the cable car down to Weggis. Holders of Eurail and InterRail passes receive a 50% discount on fares, while Swiss Pass holders travel free.
The 33-room Rigi Kulm Hotel (%041 880 18 88; www.rigikulm.ch; Mt Rigi; s Sfr148-203, d Sfr228-318; W) is the only major establishment at the summit and commands stirring views. For those not staying the night, there’s a good restaurant and self-service cafeteria with panoramic terrace. Other hotels and eateries dot the slopes of the mountain further down.
Rigi is a magnet for hikers; for recommended routes, check the Rigi website. Several easy walks (one to two hours) lead down from Rigi Kulm to Rigi Kaltbad, with wonderful views. Tourist offices in Lucerne and Weggis can provide information on the Rigi Lehnenweg, a scenic 17.5km trek around the mountain.
Hiking up the mountain is another story. It’s at least a 4½-hour climb from Weggis; alternatively, take the cable car (www.luftseilbahnseebodenalp.ch; one-way/return Sfr13/22) from Küssnacht to Seebodenalp, where a steepish path leads to the summit in just over two hours. While hiking on Rigi, watch out for the Chlyni Lüüt, tiny ‘wild folk’ with supernatural powers who in mythology once inhabited Rigi!
On the way down, soothe your muscles at the recently opened Mineralbad & Spa Rigi Kaltbad (www.mineralbad-rigikaltbad.ch; adult/child Sfr35/15), designed by renowned Swiss architect Mario Botta. Basic admission includes unlimited daylight use of the mineral baths; more decadent options include candlelit evening soaks (Sfr50) and massage-and-prosecco packages (Sfr95 to Sfr145).
Weggis
Pop 4181 / Elev 440m
Sheltered from cold northerlies by Mt Rigi, Weggis enjoys a mild climate, sprouting a few palm and fig trees by the lakefront. It’s hard to believe this genteel resort with small-town friendliness was the birthplace of the rebellious ‘Moderner Bund’ art movement, the forerunner of Dada. A cable car runs from here up to Rigi Kaltbad (10 minutes, one-way/return Sfr30/48).

You couldn't ask for a sweeter location, smack on the shores of Lake Lucerne, with its own kayaks and swimming platform. The nicest, lodge-style rooms with dreamy lake views are in the centuries-old main building (though be forewarned: ceilings are low and walls are thin); cheaper rooms are just up the hill. The fab breakfast includes local cheese and homemade granola, and dinner (Sfr17.50) is available nightly upon request.
The hostel is only a 15-minute bus ride from either Weggis or Brunnen (bus 2, Gersau-Rotschuo stop).

Lake Uri
Scything through rugged mountains, the fjord-like Lake Uri (Urnersee) finger of Lake Lucerne mirrors the country’s medieval past in its glassy turquoise waters. For memorable perspectives on the lake and the legendary events that unfolded here, take SGV's regular ferry service from Brunnen towards Flüelen.
West across the lake from Brunnen, you’ll glimpse a near 30m-high natural obelisk, the Schillerstein, protruding from the water. Its gold inscription pays homage to Friedrich Schiller, the author of the play Wilhelm Tell, so instrumental in creating the Tell legend.
The boat's first stop is the Rütli Meadow (Seelisberg), cradle of Swiss democracy. This is where the Oath of Eternal Alliance was allegedly signed by the three cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden in 1291 and later where General Guisan gathered the Swiss army during WWII in a show of force against potential invaders. As such, this is hallowed ground to Swiss patriots and the focus of national day celebrations on 1 August.
The next important port of call is the serene Tellskapelle (William Tell Chapel), covered in murals depicting four episodes in the Tell legend, including the one that’s supposed to have occurred on this spot, his escape from Gessler’s boat. There’s a huge carillon that chimes behind the chapel. Approaching from land instead of water you pass – would you Adam and Eve it – apple orchards, which might make your crossbow twitch if you had one.
After crossing into Uri canton, the boat chugs into Flüelen at the lake's southeastern corner, which was historically a staging post for the mule trains crossing the St Gotthard Pass. Today it’s a stop on the main road and rail route. Near Flüelen is Altdorf, where William Tell is reputed to have performed his apple-shooting stunt. A statue of the man himself stands in the main square, and Schiller’s play is sometimes performed in Altdorf’s Tellspielhaus. In nearby Bürglen (believed to be William Tell’s birthplace), you can visit the Tell Museum (www.tellmuseum.ch; Postplatz, Bürglen; adult/child Sfr5.50/1.50; h10am-5pm Jul & Aug, 10am-11.30am & 1.30-5pm May, Jun, Sep & Oct), a collection of Tell-related objects, documents and artistic works. Both Altdorf and Bürglen are easily accessible by bus from Flüelen.

SWISS PATH

Equipped with a decent pair of walking boots, you can circumnavigate Lake Uri on foot via the Swiss Path (Weg der Schweiz; www.weg-der-schweiz.ch) from Brunnen to Rütli, inaugurated to commemorate the 700th anniversary of Switzerland's 1291 founding pact. As the spectacular views unfold, so too does the symbolism – the trail is divided into 26 sections, each representing a different canton, from the founding trio to Johnny-come-lately Jura (1979). As you stride, bear in mind that 5mm of track represents one Swiss resident, so populous Zürich spans 6.1km and rural Appenzell Innerrhoden a mere 71m.
The 35km, two-day walk over hill and dale takes in some of Central Switzerland’s finest scenery, cutting through meadows flecked with orchids and ox-eye daisies, revealing classic Alpine panoramas, shimmying close to the lakeshore and then dipping back into ferny forest. You’ll pass historically significant landmarks such as the Tellskapelle and the obelisk commemorating Schiller . To get a true sense of the area, it’s worth completing the entire trail, but it can be broken down into shorter chunks. See the website for maps and distances.
Brunnen
Pop 8597 / Elev
435m
Tucked into the folds of mountains, where Lake Lucerne and Lake Uri meet at right angles, Brunnen enjoys mesmerising views south and west. A regular guest, Turner was so impressed by the vista that he whipped out his watercolours to paint The Bay of Uri from Brunnen (1841). As the local föhn wind rushes down from the mountains, it creates perfect conditions for sailing and paragliding. And don’t forget the folkloric hot air of the weekly alpenhorn concerts in summer.

8Getting There & Away
The most pleasant way to reach Brunnen is by boat from Lucerne (Sfr39, two hours). The train (Sfr16.60, 45 to 50 minutes) is cheaper and quicker, although a change in Arth-Goldau is sometimes necessary. There are also road connections from Lucerne, Zug and Flüelen. Bus 2 (two to four hourly) connects Brunnen with Schwyz and points west along the lakeshore towards Küssnacht, including Weggis and Vitznau.
Schwyz
Pop 14,663 / Elev 516m
The arrow-shaped Mythen mountains (1898m and 1811m) give Schwyz its edge. And not only the peaks here are jagged. Surrounded by cow-grazed pastures, this unassuming little town is the birthplace of that pocket-sized, multifunctional camping lifesaver – the Swiss army knife. As if that wasn’t enough, it’s also home to the most important document in Swiss history, the 1291 charter of federation.

HauptplatzSQUARE
Most action in Schwyz spirals around the gurgling fountain on cobbled Hauptplatz (main square), dominated by the Rathaus (town hall), complete with elaborate 19th-century murals depicting the Battle of Morgarten, and the baroque St Martin’s Church.
Hölloch CavesCAVE

8Getting There & Away
Regular trains connect Schwyz with Zug (Sfr9.40, 30 minutes) and Lucerne (Sfr14.60, 40 minutes). To reach the centre from Schwyz's train station (2km northwest in Seewen), take any bus marked Schwyz Post and alight at Postplatz (five minutes).
Schwyz is 2km off the A4 freeway, which passes through Brunnen. AAGS buses run frequently from the central Schwyz Post stop to Brunnen's Bahnhof (bus 2, 10 minutes, two to four hourly).
Einsiedeln
Pop 14,632 / Elev 900m
Pilgrims flock to Einsiedeln, Switzerland’s answer to Lourdes. The story goes that in AD 964 the Bishop of Constance tried to consecrate the original monastery but was halted by a heavenly voice, declaring: ‘Desist. God Himself has consecrated this building.’ A papal order later recognised this as a genuine miracle. Even if you don’t believe in miracles, the fabulously over-the-top interior of the abbey church is still a must-see.
Einsiedeln's train station and post office are in the town centre opposite Dorfplatz; head through this square and turn left into Hauptstrasse. The church is at the end of this street, overlooking Klosterplatz (a 10-minute walk).
1Sights & Activities
KlosterkircheCHURCH
(Abbey Church; %055 418 61 11; www.kloster-einsiedeln.ch; Benzigerstrasse; h6am- 8.30pm)
Follow the crowds flowing towards this baroque edifice, the 18th-century handiwork of Caspar Moosbrugger. The interior dances with colourful frescos, stucco and gold swirls. Yet most pilgrims are oblivious to the marbled opulence, directing their prayers to the holiest of holies, the Black Madonna, a tiny statue in a chapel by the entrance.
Bethlehem DioramaRELIGIOUS

Near the church; can help you find a bed in one of the town’s numerous hotels.
8Getting There & Away
Einsiedeln is in a rail cul-de-sac, so getting there usually involves changing trains. Trains to Lucerne (Sfr22.80, 1¼ hours) require a connection at Biberbrugg and/or Arth-Goldau. The most convenient connections to Zürich (Sfr20.80, 50 minutes) are via S-Bahn, with a change at Wädenswil.
Engelberg
Pop 3989 / Elev 1050m
Engelberg (literally ‘Angel Mountain’) attracts two kinds of pilgrims: those seeking spiritual enlightenment in its Benedictine monastery and those worshipping the virgin powder on its divine slopes. Framed by the glacial bulk of Mt Titlis and frosted peaks, it’s little wonder the scenery here features in many a Bollywood production. It’s a miracle that despite its deep snow, impeccable off-piste credentials and proximity to Lucerne, Engelberg remains lesser known than other resorts of its size. A blessing, some say.

The Engelberg valley was once ecclesiastically governed and the Benedictine abbey was the seat of power. Now the resident monks teach instead of rule, but their 12th-century home has kept its grandeur. Rebuilt after a devastating fire in 1729, it contains rooms decorated with incredibly detailed wood inlays, and a baroque monastery church.
A 4pm tour is always available from mid-June to early October regardless of group size; at other times, a four-person minimum may apply.

2Activities
Hiking
There are some 360km of marked hiking trails in and around Engelberg. For gentle ambles and gorgeous scenery, head for Brunni on the opposite side of the valley. The Brunni cable car ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.brunni.ch; cable car one-way/return Sfr18/30, incl chairlift one-way/return Sfr26/42) goes up to Ristis at 1600m, where a chairlift takes you to the Swiss Alpine Club's refurbished Brunni Hütte ( GOOGLE MAP ; %041 637 37 32; www.berghuette.ch; dm adult/child Sfr26/14, incl breakfast & dinner adult Sfr65, child Sfr18-41). From here you can watch a magnificent sunset before spending the night.
More strenuous hikes include the trek over the Surenenpass (2291m) to Attinghausen, where you can catch a bus to Altdorf and the southern end of Lake Uri, and the climb over Jochpass (2210m) to Meiringen via Engstlenalp. Pick up a map and check on snow conditions before attempting these more demanding treks.
Skiing & Snowboarding
Snowboarders catch big air on Titlis, Engstlenalp and the half-pipe at Jochpass, while novice and intermediate skiers slide over to family-friendly Brunni and Gerschnialp for baby blues and cruisy reds. The real thrills for powder hounds, however, lie off-piste. Backcountry legends include Laub, Steinberg and the biggest leg-burner of all, Galtiberg, running from Klein Titlis to the valley 2000m below. A one-day ski pass costs Sfr62.
There’s a Ski & Snowboard School ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %041 639 54 54; www.skischule-engelberg.ch; Klosterstrasse 3; h8am-5.30pm) inside the tourist office, and places to hire ski/snowboard gear (from about Sfr50 per day) throughout town. Ski Lodge Engelberg is another great source of information, or stop by Dani’s Okay Ski Shop ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %041 637 07 77; www.okay-shop.com; Hotel Bellevue, Bahnhofplatz), where hardcore riders hang out and exchange tips.

8Getting There & Around
Engelberg is the southern terminus of the Engelberg Express train, which runs hourly to/from Lucerne (Sfr17.40, 45 minutes). Day-trippers should check the Lucerne tourist office’s Mt Titlis excursion tickets. A small road off the A2 freeway near Stans leads to Engelberg.
From late April through October, a free shuttle bus leaves Engelberg's train station roughly every half-hour between 8am and 5pm for all the village’s major hotels and attractions. In winter, free ski buses follow multiple routes to and from the slopes.
MT TITLIS

With a name that makes English speakers titter, Titlis ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.titlis.ch) is Central Switzerland’s tallest mountain, has its only glacier and is reached by the world’s first revolving cable car ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.titlis.ch/en/tickets/cable-car-ride; adult/child return Sfr89/44.50; h8.30am-5pm), completed in 1992. However, that’s the last leg of a breathtaking three-stage journey. First, you glide up to Trübsee (1800m) via Gerschnialp (1300m; don't get off at Gerschnialp if you're continuing to the top). Next, a larger gondola at Trübsee whisks you up to Stand (2450m), where you board the revolving Rotair for the final head-spinning journey over the dazzling Titlis Glacier. As you twirl above the deeply crevassed ice, peaks rise like shark fins ahead, while tarn-speckled pastures, cliffs and waterfalls lie behind.
A glacial blast of air hits you at Titlis station (3020m). Inside is a kind of high-altitude theme park, with a marvellously kitsch ice cave where you can watch neon lights make the sculpted ice tunnels sparkle. There’s also an overpriced restaurant and a nostalgic photo studio on the 4th floor, which specialises in snaps of Bollywood stars in dirndls. Strike a pose with a giant Toblerone or an alpenhorn against a backdrop of fake snowy mountains from Sfr35.
The genuine oohs and ahs come when you step out onto the terrace, where the panorama of glacier-capped peaks stretches to Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau in the Bernese Oberland. For even more thrilling views, step onto the adjacent Cliff Walk (www.titlis.ch/en/glacier/cliff-walk; h9.15am-4.45pm), a 100m-long, 1m-wide, cable-supported swinging walkway that qualified as Europe's highest suspension bridge when opened in 2012. More ambitious hikers can tackle the 45-minute climb to Titlis' 3239m summit (wear sturdy shoes).
For winter sports thrills even in midsummer, take the Ice Flyer chairlift (adult/child Sfr12/6; h9.30am-4.30pm) down to the Glacier Park (www.titlis.ch/en/glacier/glacier-park; h9.30am-4.30pm), where there are free snow tubes, scooters and sledges to test out. The nearby freestyle park has a half-pipe and good summer snowboarding.
The return trip to Titlis (roughly 45 minutes each way) costs Sfr89 from Engelberg. However, in fine weather, you can walk some sections. Between Stand and Trübsee, the Geologischer Wanderweg is open from July to September; it takes about two hours up and 1½ hours down. From Trübsee up to Jochpass (2207m) takes about 1½ hours, and down to Engelberg takes around the same time.
If you’re hiking, destinations from Engelberg include Gerschnialp (one-way/return Sfr8/12), Trübsee (Sfr21/30), Jochpass (Sfr31/44) and Stand (Sfr36/51). Reductions on all fares, including to Titlis, are 50% for Swiss, Eurail and InterRail pass holders.
The last ascent by cable car is at 3.40pm, last descent at 4.50pm; it closes for maintenance for two weeks in early November.
Zug
Pop 27,537 / Elev 426m
On the face of it, Zug appears like many other Swiss towns: lapped by a lake and ringed by mountains. However, this is the richest city in one of the world’s richest countries. But you probably won’t care as you devour Kirschtorte, stroll the cobblestoned medieval streets or savour million-dollar sunsets, because Zug’s low-key like that.
1Sights & Activities
Zug's well-preserved medieval Old Town, 1km south of the train station, revolves around the Zytturm (Kolinplatz) – an attractive clock tower whose roof is distinctively tiled in blue-and-white cantonal colours. Walking through the arch, you can veer off into the pedestrian-only lanes of Fischmarkt, Ober Altstadt and Unter Altstadt, punctuated by frescoed 15th-century town houses and hole-in-the-wall boutiques. Watch for the fountain depicting Gret Schell, an old hag of a Fasnacht character, who lugs her drunken husband home in a basket. Beaches and other public spaces line the pretty lakefront, which is also fun to explore by boat or bicycle.
Kunsthaus ZugMUSEUM

With the cheerful (albeit self-serving) motto, 'Keep your curves – enjoy life!', this old-style cafe is a quaint marriage between an English tearoom and an ultra-Swiss bakery. Locals swear by its Zuger Kirschtorte (pastry, biscuit, almond paste and butter cream cake, infused with cherry liqueur); grab a slice (Sfr4.50) or the whole cake (seven sizes from Sfr12.50 to Sfr48.50).

Zug is on the main north–south train route from Zürich (Sfr16.60, 25 to 45 minutes) to Lugano. Trains also run regularly to Lucerne (Sfr11.40, 20 to 45 minutes).
For drivers, the north–south N4 runs just west of town, offering good connections north to Zürich, and south towards Lucerne, St Gotthard Pass, Lugano and Italy.
In summer, Zugersee Schifffahrt (www.zugersee-schifffahrt.ch) operates boats from Zug’s Schiffsstation, north of Landsgemeindeplatz, to Arth and other destinations around the lake.
BOOMTOWN RATS

Once upon a time, Zug was home to struggling farmers. But 1946 marked the start of its rags-to-riches transformation, when the cantonal government decided to implement one of the world’s lowest tax rates. Suddenly tycoons and global multinationals bypassed Zürich to flock here. Today Zug’s 29,000-odd registered companies include Biogen, Transocean, Shell Brands International and the world’s richest commodities trader, Glencore.
Though Zug might seem unassuming, even a modest apartment can cost at least Sfr1.5 million, so you need to be rich to milk this cash cow.
Andermatt
Pop 1320 / Elev 1447m
Blessed with austere mountain appeal, Andermatt contrasts low-key village charm with big wilderness. Once an important staging-post on the north–south St Gotthard route, Andermatt is now bypassed by the tunnel, but remains a major crossroads, with the Furka Pass corkscrewing west to Valais and the Oberalp Pass looping east to Graubünden.
The Orascom leisure development group has recently invested Sfr1 billion towards construction of a year-round megaresort in Andermatt. In December 2013 the company opened its five-star hotel, followed in 2014 by an 18-hole high-altitude golf course. More hotels are planned, but for now the traditional charm of the town centre remains blissfully intact.
1Sights & Activities
As Andermatt is situated near four major Alpine passes – Susten, Oberalp, St Gotthard and Furka – it’s a terrific base for hiking, cycling and bus tours. The tourist office distributes free bilingual (German-English) booklets outlining hiking and cycling opportunities. Check www.postbus.ch for current bus tour offerings.
GemsstockMOUNTAIN
(www.skiarena.ch)
The 2963m mountain, reached by the Gemsstockbahn cable car from Andermatt (one-way/return Sfr36/50), attracts hikers in summer and intermediate skiers coming for the snow-sure slopes in winter. The region is also beloved by off-piste skiers seeking fresh powder. Ski passes cost Sfr58 per day for Gemsstock; passes for the nearby slopes of Nätschen/Gütsch and Realp cost Sfr48 and Sfr29, respectively. Toboggan runs, well-prepared walking trails and sleigh rides appeal to nonskiers in winter.
Steam TrainsRAILWAY
(Dampfbahn Furka-Bergstrecke; www.dfb.ch; one-way/return Sfr73/121; hFri-Sun late Jun–late Sep, daily early Jul–mid-Aug)
From Realp, along the flat valley, steam trains run via Furka to Oberwald. Realp is 9km southwest of Andermatt.
HikingHIKING
One popular hike leads from the nearby Oberalp Pass to sparkly Lai da Tuma, the source of the Rhine. Drive or take a train to the pass; the 11km round trip takes three to four hours, with 500m elevation gain.
For a vertigo-inducing climb, check out the Diavolo via ferrata, a three-hour round-trip scramble over granite faces and grassy ledges. It affords dizzying perspectives over the Devil’s Bridge, which crosses the precipitous Schöllenen Gorge of the Reuss River.
4Sleeping & Eating
The tourist office can help find private rooms; note that many places close between the peak winter and summer seasons. There are numerous restaurants along Gotthardstrasse; restaurants at Hotel Sonne and River House Boutique hotel are also open to non-guests.

The train station is 400m north of the village centre. If arriving from Zürich (Sfr44, two hours), Locarno (Sfr40, 1¾ hours) or other points north and south, you'll need to change trains at Göschenen for the final 10-minute climb to Andermatt.
Andermatt is also directly linked by the east–west Glacier Express (www.glacierexpress.ch; reservation required) to Zermatt (Sfr70, three hours) and St Moritz (Sfr80, five hours).
AMatterhorn Gotthard Bahn (www.mgbahn.ch) can supply details about the car-carrying trains over the Oberalp Pass to Graubünden and through the Furka Tunnel to Valais. Postal buses stop by the train station.
The 15km St Gotthard Tunnel is one of the busiest north–south routes across the Alps, running from Göschenen to close to Airolo (Ticino), bypassing Andermatt. The new St Gotthard Base Tunnel, designed for high-speed and freight trains, will be the world’s longest rail tunnel and is scheduled to open in early 2017.
