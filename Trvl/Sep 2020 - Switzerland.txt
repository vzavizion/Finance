			Riffelsee lake: the most beautiful of photographic subjects, with reflection of the Matterhorn. Wealth of alpine flora

			
			travel from Zermatt to Rotenboden station with the Gornergrat Bahn. From there, take the "Riffelsee hiking path", it is just under a 10 minute walk to reach the Riffelsee
			
			Tip: visit the Riffelsee early in the morning or late in the evening. That's when weather conditions will usually be calm and give you the perfect conditions in which to admire and photograph the reflection of the Matterhorn
			
			Tip: sunrise is an unforgettable moment when the clear surface of the Riffelsee lake reflects the orange-tinted peak of the Matterhorn
			
			Tip: Consider first riding all the way up to the Gornergrat on the 111-year-old Gornergrat Bahn cog railway. The view from the observation platform: a breathtaking panorama of glaciers and mountains, including 29 peaks above 4,000 m. Then ride back to Rotenboden.
			
			Riffelsee insider tip: Not many people know that not far from the famous Riffelsee lake in the direction of the Riffelberg there is small, nameless lake which is seldom discovered by tourists and is the ideal spot to take peaceful photos of a reflected Matterhorn.
				45.983218, 7.757979
			
			Tip: continue along the Riffelsee lake path and up to Riffelberg station. Apart from the pleasure of seeing the lake the remainder of the hike gives great views across an amazing mountain panorama including the Matterhorn. You will pass the little Riffelberg chapel where Brother Klaus once lived and which is also a good place to stop and take some photos
			
			Tip: from Riffelberg station you can then choose to take the historic Mark Twain path up to Riffelalp

	Viewpoints
		Viewpoint Kirchbrücke bridge
			one of the best known and loved viewpoints in the village
			get up early - make sure you don't miss the first rays of sun on the Matterhorn
				Ideal time: before sunrise. The spectacle begins as the sun’s first rays light up the pinnacle of the Matterhorn. Duration: just a few minutes			
			https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Attractions/Viewpoint-Kirchbruecke-bridge
		
		Kirchplatz viewpoint
			You can either climb a few of the church steps or stand on the Community Centre's terrace (open to the public). The traditional wooden houses in the foreground add a special charm to a beautiful picture. You can include another typical Swiss emblem in your picture too - there’s a huge bronze alphorn on the steps of the building – a traditional Swiss instrument		
			https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Attractions/Photopoint-Kirchplatz-and-the-Community-Centre-terrace
			 
		Viewpoint at the bench on Höhbalmen hiking trail
			these views have to be earned: there’s no cable car up here. Once you reach the top, you are almost at eye level with the Matterhorn - around three hours hiking time
			https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Attractions/Point-Photo-Small-bench-at-Hoehbalmen
			
		Hidden Valley viewpoint
			secluded location far away from everything. There are no signposts so it’s not easy to find. For those who make it, however, a quiet and idyllic valley awaits: green meadows, a small river and a view of the Matterhorn at the end of the valley

		Riffelsee lake viewpoint
			draws people from around the world: a viewpoint that is high on the bucket lists of Zermatt visitors. Especially beautiful in in autumn with its orange-yellow hues. To enjoy the silence and fully appreciate the natural beauty, it's worth getting up early to catch the first train
			best time to visit is when there is no wind and the surface of the lake is completely still – usually early in the morning or in the evening
			https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Attractions/Riffelsee
			
		Stellisee lake viewpoint
			subject of numerous advertising posters - at sunrise and sunset, especially
			combine this viewpoint easily with the Five Lakes Walk

		Walking Tour
			Cima della Trosa
				high-level route
				eagle’s-eye perspectives of Lago Maggiore and Alpine peaks

				START CARDADA, LOCARNO
				FINISH MERGOSCIA
				LENGTH 10KM; 3¾ TO FIVE HOURS

				From the upper cable-car station at Cardada, head right, climbing around the open slopes to reach the rustic stone hut of Capanna Lo Stallone in the grassy hollow of Alpe Cardada (1486m), after 30 to 40 minutes. The track cuts back left over the bracken-covered mountainsides, then swings right to skirt the forest and arrive at 1671m Capanna Cimetta.
				Below the upper chairlift station, the left-hand path descends quickly to a saddle (1610m) with a springwater fountain. Make a rising traverse of the southwestern slopes of Cima della Trosa. A short side trail brings you to the cross mounted on the windswept 1869m summit after a further 35 to 45 minutes.
				The path soon winds down Cima della Trosa’s northeastern flank to a minor col (1657m). From here a side trip to the often snow-dusted peak of Madone (2039m) takes 1½ to two hours; the straightforward route follows the ridge, with some harmless rock-scrambling and arresting views higher up.
				Descend in broad zigzags to Alpe di Bietri (1499m), stopping for creamy goat’s cheese made at the dairy, then continuing on an old mule trail tracing the northern slopes of Valle di Mergoscia. The route descends gently past dilapidated houses and rustic hamlets to reach Bresciadiga (1128m), 1¼ to 1¾ hours from Cima della Trosa.
				Bear right at a junction, leading past small shrines before coming into a car park. Stroll 600m downhill to intersect with the main road, then follow the sealed road left up steep, vine-clad hillsides to arrive at the square beside the large baroque church of postcard-pretty Mergoscia, sitting high above the Val Verzasca, after a final one-to-1¼-hour leg. From Mergoscia, bus 312 runs every two hours back to Locarno (Sfr6.20, 37 minutes).
