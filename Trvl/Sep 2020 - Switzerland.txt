				Riffelsee lake: the most beautiful of photographic subjects, with reflection of the Matterhorn. Wealth of alpine flora

				
				travel from Zermatt to Rotenboden station with the Gornergrat Bahn. From there, take the "Riffelsee hiking path", it is just under a 10 minute walk to reach the Riffelsee
				
				Tip: visit the Riffelsee early in the morning or late in the evening. That's when weather conditions will usually be calm and give you the perfect conditions in which to admire and photograph the reflection of the Matterhorn
				
				Tip: sunrise is an unforgettable moment when the clear surface of the Riffelsee lake reflects the orange-tinted peak of the Matterhorn
				
				Tip: Consider first riding all the way up to the Gornergrat on the 111-year-old Gornergrat Bahn cog railway. The view from the observation platform: a breathtaking panorama of glaciers and mountains, including 29 peaks above 4,000 m. Then ride back to Rotenboden.
				
				Riffelsee insider tip: Not many people know that not far from the famous Riffelsee lake in the direction of the Riffelberg there is small, nameless lake which is seldom discovered by tourists and is the ideal spot to take peaceful photos of a reflected Matterhorn.
					45.983218, 7.757979
				
				Tip: continue along the Riffelsee lake path and up to Riffelberg station. Apart from the pleasure of seeing the lake the remainder of the hike gives great views across an amazing mountain panorama including the Matterhorn. You will pass the little Riffelberg chapel where Brother Klaus once lived and which is also a good place to stop and take some photos
				
				Tip: from Riffelberg station you can then choose to take the historic Mark Twain path up to Riffelalp
					Google Maps
						Mark Twain Weg
						
				!!!
				Riffelsee lake viewpoint
					draws people from around the world: a viewpoint that is high on the bucket lists of Zermatt visitors. Especially beautiful in in autumn with its orange-yellow hues. To enjoy the silence and fully appreciate the natural beauty, it's worth getting up early to catch the first train
					best time to visit is when there is no wind and the surface of the lake is completely still – usually early in the morning or in the evening

	Legend has it that an angel with a light showed the first settlers where to build a chapel in Lucerne, and today it still has amazing grace


	Kapellbrücke

		octagonal water tower is original, but its gabled roof is a modern reconstruction, rebuilt after a disastrous fire in 1993

		Heinrich Wägmann’s 17th-century triangular roof panels, showing important events from Swiss history and mythology. The icon is at its most photogenic when bathed in soft golden light at dusk
			roof panels with scenes from the history of Lucerne and episodes in the lives of the martyrs St Leodegar and St Mauritius, who became the town’s patron saints

	Lion Monument
		10m-long sculpture of a dying lion - to commemorate Swiss soldiers who died defending King Louis XVI during the French Revolution
			on 10 August 1792, the guards defended the Palais des Tuileries, in Paris, when it was stormed by revolutionaries. Those who survived the attack were arrested and guillotined on the night of 2–3 September
		Mark Twain once called it the ‘saddest and most moving piece of rock in the world’

	Spreuerbrücke
		darker and smaller but entirely original

		this was the only bridge where Lucerne's medieval villagers were allowed to throw Spreu (chaff) into the river

		roof panels consist of artist Caspar Meglinger’s movie-storyboard-style sequence of paintings, The Dance of Death, showing how the plague affected all levels of society
		
		bridge’s roof is lined with panels painted by Kaspar Meglinger in 1626–35. Depicting the Dance of Death, they run in sequence from the north bank and culminate with Christ’s triumph over Death at the south bank
		
		Nadelwerk, a device that controls floods, stands downstream of the bridge

	Museggmauer

		buzzes with life, particularly on market days
		
		Fritschi Fountain, adorned with allegorical figures depicting Brother Fritschi, a figure of Swiss legend who features in Lucerne’s Carnival tradition

		18th-century chapel, St Peterskapelle, which stands on the site of a 12th-century church, the earliest to be built in Luzern. The chapel contains a 14th-century Gothic crucifix
		
	Weinmarkt
		one of the most attractive features of the Old Town
		
		Weinmarktbrunnen, a Gothic fountain
		
		houses around both this square and the adjacent Hirschenplatz have painted façades, ornate doorways and oriel windows. Many of these buildings were once guildhouses

				START CARDADA, LOCARNO
				FINISH MERGOSCIA
				LENGTH 10KM; 3¾ TO FIVE HOURS

				From the upper cable-car station at Cardada, head right, climbing around the open slopes to reach the rustic stone hut of Capanna Lo Stallone in the grassy hollow of Alpe Cardada (1486m), after 30 to 40 minutes. The track cuts back left over the bracken-covered mountainsides, then swings right to skirt the forest and arrive at 1671m Capanna Cimetta.
				Below the upper chairlift station, the left-hand path descends quickly to a saddle (1610m) with a springwater fountain. Make a rising traverse of the southwestern slopes of Cima della Trosa. A short side trail brings you to the cross mounted on the windswept 1869m summit after a further 35 to 45 minutes.
				The path soon winds down Cima della Trosa’s northeastern flank to a minor col (1657m). From here a side trip to the often snow-dusted peak of Madone (2039m) takes 1½ to two hours; the straightforward route follows the ridge, with some harmless rock-scrambling and arresting views higher up.
				Descend in broad zigzags to Alpe di Bietri (1499m), stopping for creamy goat’s cheese made at the dairy, then continuing on an old mule trail tracing the northern slopes of Valle di Mergoscia. The route descends gently past dilapidated houses and rustic hamlets to reach Bresciadiga (1128m), 1¼ to 1¾ hours from Cima della Trosa.
				Bear right at a junction, leading past small shrines before coming into a car park. Stroll 600m downhill to intersect with the main road, then follow the sealed road left up steep, vine-clad hillsides to arrive at the square beside the large baroque church of postcard-pretty Mergoscia, sitting high above the Val Verzasca, after a final one-to-1¼-hour leg. From Mergoscia, bus 312 runs every two hours back to Locarno (Sfr6.20, 37 minutes).

LOW-COST LAKESIDE LIVING

Dreaming of a lakeside getaway that won't max out your budget? Look no further than the SYHA Hostel Rotschuo (%041 828 12 77; www.hostelrotschuo.ch; Seestrasse 163, Gersau; dm Sfr30-32, s Sfr 40-72, d Sfr64-108; W), midway between Weggis and Brunnen. You couldn't ask for a sweeter location, smack on the shores of Lake Lucerne, with its own kayaks and swimming platform. The nicest, lodge-style rooms with dreamy lake views are in the centuries-old main building (though be forewarned: ceilings are low and walls are thin); cheaper rooms are just up the hill. The fab breakfast includes local cheese and homemade granola, and dinner (Sfr17.50) is available nightly upon request.
The hostel is only a 15-minute bus ride from either Weggis or Brunnen (bus 2, Gersau-Rotschuo stop).

Lake Uri
Scything through rugged mountains, the fjord-like Lake Uri (Urnersee) finger of Lake Lucerne mirrors the country’s medieval past in its glassy turquoise waters. For memorable perspectives on the lake and the legendary events that unfolded here, take SGV's regular ferry service from Brunnen towards Flüelen.
West across the lake from Brunnen, you’ll glimpse a near 30m-high natural obelisk, the Schillerstein, protruding from the water. Its gold inscription pays homage to Friedrich Schiller, the author of the play Wilhelm Tell, so instrumental in creating the Tell legend.
The boat's first stop is the Rütli Meadow (Seelisberg), cradle of Swiss democracy. This is where the Oath of Eternal Alliance was allegedly signed by the three cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden in 1291 and later where General Guisan gathered the Swiss army during WWII in a show of force against potential invaders. As such, this is hallowed ground to Swiss patriots and the focus of national day celebrations on 1 August.
The next important port of call is the serene Tellskapelle (William Tell Chapel), covered in murals depicting four episodes in the Tell legend, including the one that’s supposed to have occurred on this spot, his escape from Gessler’s boat. There’s a huge carillon that chimes behind the chapel. Approaching from land instead of water you pass – would you Adam and Eve it – apple orchards, which might make your crossbow twitch if you had one.
After crossing into Uri canton, the boat chugs into Flüelen at the lake's southeastern corner, which was historically a staging post for the mule trains crossing the St Gotthard Pass. Today it’s a stop on the main road and rail route. Near Flüelen is Altdorf, where William Tell is reputed to have performed his apple-shooting stunt. A statue of the man himself stands in the main square, and Schiller’s play is sometimes performed in Altdorf’s Tellspielhaus. In nearby Bürglen (believed to be William Tell’s birthplace), you can visit the Tell Museum (www.tellmuseum.ch; Postplatz, Bürglen; adult/child Sfr5.50/1.50; h10am-5pm Jul & Aug, 10am-11.30am & 1.30-5pm May, Jun, Sep & Oct), a collection of Tell-related objects, documents and artistic works. Both Altdorf and Bürglen are easily accessible by bus from Flüelen.
