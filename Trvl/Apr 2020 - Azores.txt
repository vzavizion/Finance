	Lajes beach – ideal for beach-goers who are looking for a more “Azorean style” place to go for a swim (black sand, rugged basalt rocks, and a little rougher waves)
	Fajã Grande beach – resort-like beach (although, technically, this is not a beach) where you can choose to swim or just drop by to have a couple of cold drinks in the sun, at the nearby bar and café
		Cycling and mountain biking
		Canoeing and kayaking
	!!!
	Poço do Bacalhau – the only lagoon and waterfall where you can actually swim (keep in mind that the water is a bit colder than the Ocean, even in summers)
		Located in Fajã Grande, this is a small pool at the bottom of a 90-metre high waterfall, where it is possible to swim
	Fajã do Conde – for the adventurous, hike all the way down for a semi-secluded swim
	
Aguas Quentes - small hot sulfur springs

Gruta dos Enxaréus - visible only by boat, the grotto is the largest of the myriad caves that open at the base of the promontory "La Caveira", about 3 km south of the capital

Fajãzinha
	A small fajã from where one can see about twenty waterfalls, the biggest of which drops for 300 metres.
	
hiking	
	PONTA DELGADA – FAJÃ GRANDE
		A trail that runs along the coastline affording a view over the Maria Vaz Islet and the island of Corvo.	
	FAJÃ DE LOPO VAZ
		A circular trail where you’ll often come across wild goats whilst walking.
	LAJEDO – FAJÃ GRANDE
		A trail that passes through the Seca and Branca Lakes, both sites of community interest.
	
???
Aldeia da Cuada – abandoned houses now transformed into cozy accommodation units
Forest Reserve of Fazenda de Santa Cruz
Fajã de Lopo Vaz
	Named after one of the first settlers, this was probably the first place to be inhabited on this island. There are some wild goats in this fajã.

Corvo Island
	Caldeirão lagoon
		best hiking trail – goes from the village all the way up to Caldeirão	
	Praia da Areia – in English it means “sand beach” because it’s the only sand beach on the Island 


Tips
	We had a half day tour upon arrival in Flores, visited 7 lakes, waterfalls and several view points on the way to Fajã grande.
	
	After seeing people on the island in the Summer of 2018 who arrived without having booked accommodation, I cannot stress this enough: always book accommodation in advance. In fact, book accommodation before you book the flight.

Apartment Apartamento Mar e Sol, 67m    360 R   ?
The foam mattress was a bit uncomfortable to sleep on
The apt is on the second floor
In the bathroom there was no ventilation or a window, so it is very stuffy and humid.
The neighbors are very loud (drilling, for example, at 11pm).

Mitós Vila 3, 45m  350 R   !
-
Unfortunately we had a bad time, it was a bit cool in the house despite the heating.
If I had to put a but, the living room is a bit dim and the bathroom gets a bit wet after the shower and does not just dry well. A few little cupboards would also be good as well as the shelves. I missed a cutting board in the kitchen. But these are all very small details compared to how well the apartment is.
Could be cold in bathroom
+
Very quiet area, always with a place to park and with good access.
Check in was super easy, he welcomed us from the airport with a fruit basket and local bread which went down a treat after the long morning of travel. 	
High humidity. I think a bathroom heater would be handy in winter.
2018
A/C !!!!! in living room
Great location
If you would like go on the boat trip or go to fishing - the Vila has also a boat for boat tours you just need to contact Daniel and schedule (great price). 

4.
Apartment Cosy Island Apartment, 89m  445 R   ?
-
Since 2015
Some humidity in the room coming from the wardrobe and the lack of air conditioning that would help to dehumidify the house.
Bathroom very dark and poorly ventilated.
The sofa in the living room has a modern design but is not very comfortable.
The television in the room should be bigger as it looks more like a computer monitor adapted to the TV.
Noise from road
I was worried I would be charged for towel and linen use based on the instructions sent from the host, which made my stay less enjoyable as I was hesitant to use towels and sheets. No A/C and very humid (but that is typical in this area). 
Hosts answer: we have several bathing areas with hot yellow-colored ferrous water witch is very difficult to remove from tissues. Often guests go to these bathing areas sometimes they take the white towels with them or when they take a bad shower at home and do not remove the iron from the hair and skin, damaging the towels and sheets.

I was surprised that the bathroom (even if private) was external. It wasn´t indicated in description of the accomodation (I checked it many times..)

Кучи полотенец, терраса с невероятным видом на океан, близость к набережной. Невероятно вкусная собственная выпечка на завтрак и в знак приветствия при заезде, приготовленные хозяевами джемы и варенья (которые впоследствии можно приобрести у хозяев).
The breakfast is good and consists primarily of homemade and local products.
You can park right outside the building
 the hosts make an excellent cinnamon liqueur.
homemade jams (pineapple and banana were our favourite). Rossana prepared breakfast boxes when we had to leave early in the morning which was very nice from her.
o start the day, there was nothing missing on the table: homemade mermelades, cheeses, ananas da terra, eggs, (the three chickens are near in the garden) ham, etc...without forgetting a sweet that looks just a little like cream pastries and that is Eduardo's work.
We appreciated the black towels available for the beach
he property is located just 200 meters from the city center, near the main church, about 400 meters from the ocean, about 500 meters to the bus terminal

Small room
Faulty air conditioner
The ac had problems, it turned off after 3 mins
I did not like the room, it did not match the photos on Booking, it was small with no view, and the TV was very loud.
Room very small, no space to hang towels, especially bathing from the beach.
Breakfast is simple but very characteristic nan Azores with fruit, loaves of cake, coffee, tea,...( based on bought products in super market)
the fact that there are some cockroaches in the room and in the place of meals.
Probably because it is already an old facility, there is a lot of humidity in the room. When we get to the room there is that characteristic smell and the bathroom always looks wet.
There was a musty smell in the room

Lack of parking. Sometimes it was necessary to park a bit far from the accommodation.

Noise in the building.
Bad smell in the building and inside the apartment. In need of an air freshener.
A faulty sink in the bathroom sink (it must have been a long time) and the sink faucet flowed into the cabinet under the sink. We killed four cockroaches !!!0

The place is quite oldfashion and common area is not very attractive. It has not pleasent smell over there. However the most important issue why we left it was impossible sleeping conditions. The pillow are very old and has inopropriate conditions, the room does not have any mousquite's net but located in countrysided thus there are many mosquites. 
Small room with bathroom
There were a lot of flies in our room and in the common area which bothered us a lot. The decor is quite old but functional.

No kitchen
2014 but renovated?
+
Quiet
The beds are huge and so comfy. The bathroom and shower in our room was gigantic. As much food as you can eat for breakfast. Location we found ideal for reaching all corners of the island and only 17 mins from Ponta Delgada. 
We also liked the breakfast, there was a freshly baked cake every day, which was really delicious every time. There was also cheese, sausage, egg, jam etc.
The rooms are big enough and are cleaned daily.  
Everything is very stylish and comfortable! the room is so beautiful and we had the best sleeping (no noise, fresh air, super big comfortable bed and pillows)!
Rui bakes fresh cakes everyday (if you are a chocolate lover, ask for the nesquik cake!).
He is always in for a chat and gives you the best recommendations for your trips and foods and beaches around the island. He also helped us with making reservations and booking tours or taxis.
You can also store your drinks or food in the kitchen if you want.
The location is very good to visit the Island and the breakfast is very complete with coffee, tea, different milks, all kinds of breads, ham and cheese and the cakes and biscuits that Rui makes.
Very high rating
we stayed 5 nights and they even changed our sheets and towels.
We also could use the kitchen anytime we wanted to.

very small kitchen
2015
The lighting of the apartment was a bit dim; there were some crawlers (insect) found inside the house, although that's kind of expected for such a countryside location.
Seems to be very little sound proofing between apartments. So we were woken up quite early by other guests.
Noise from the lower apartment, poor soundproofing, 
Glass entrance door (cold?)

Balcony 
sweet reception basket with treats and cakes 
We used the bbq twice and enjoyed eating all our meals outside watching the sunset.

Antillia Hotel
	Buffet breakfast from 7am. But not is served even at 7:30
	11 min by car to airport
	pool, sauna and steam room - take towel from reception. Open at 9am
	The gym opening hours are weird depending on weekday vs weekend.
	Free cabled internet in the room ( don´t forget to take RJ 45 cable with you). Free Wi-Fi in all common areas. You can also borrow one from the front desk for a 10.00 Euro deposit fee.
	From the moment we arrived at 7:30 am and given our rooms immediately
	Our breakfast was included in our package deal and was enough to get anyone's day going, offering pancakes, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, bacon, toast, buns, banana bread, cheeses, cold cuts, fruit, yogurt and cereals. And of course juices, teas and coffee. 
	Парковка в гостинице бесплатная.
	we can hardly park being a holiday in the city. 
	unpleasant smell
	cocoroach
	Do you know that feeling of running out of cold water in the middle of the bath? Imagine this feeling early in the morning. In addition the central heating does not exist. There are really air conditioners, but they are locked so guests can't regulate. So we were in winter, without hot water and without heating, with total apathy from the receptionists who did nothing.
	Despite asking the hotel, half a yearag o, from which date to book when arriving at night, I endeed up without no room 1st night when arriving. The hotel "offered" me an apartment at 262€ vs the 10 nights at 100€ a night when booking in Feb18. So I had to book a room at another hotel, at a higher price, had extra costs for a taxi and basically a waste of time. This at night and I just needed a bed for 6 hours before taking the taxi back and receiving correct room for the already 10 booked nights. Horrible and uprofessionel service!
	Do not stay at this hotel!! Cruel treatment of a family with 3 kids. Would not give us a room we already paid for!! Leaving my wife and I (along with kids ages 4, 5, 7) scared and outside at 3:30 am on Thursday, August 9....in a foreign country. I think the man's name at reception was Pedro. Regardless, whatever his name is, he was rude, disrespectful, scared kids with his yelling, and ultimately is responsible for a young family spending the night outside in front of a car rental agency.
	Our trip to the Azores Islands had to be cut short due to a family emergency and we cancelled our reservation at this property. We cancelled more than a week in advance but they charged us 100% for our stay 1) even during high season and 2) even when they offer more more flexible policies on other third party sites (50% cancellation fee the day before reservation).
	bathroom (drainage poorly jointed). We will have a puddle during the whole stay. As it was not hot, I wanted to start air conditioning but it does not seem reversible although the system allows it. Stayed in May
	
13.
	New Hostel in capital
	Quite new, open only for 5 months. Staff are nice, 24h food & beverage is a bonus!! Especially for someone needs to catch the flight at 7am😂 Right in the center of the town,
	the breakfast was good (specially the quiche
	The breakfast was really good and selfmade.
	The breakfast food was always available during the day, not hidden somewhere. The staff cooks fresh pie every single day, which you can freely take any time.
	Breakfast is quite complete with bread, cheese, ham, various jams, fruit, fresh homemade cake, coffee and tea. 
	Good coffee, but no juice and yoghurts at breakfast. Homecooked pies and cakes - lovely.
	A bit noisy during the nights I had in July high season, probably from rooms above. Sounds hears to well in the building so next to reception and The dining from people hears loud and clear. Vegetables,, at breakfast gets empty, so maybe have some more (!?) of them?
	Terrible smell when we open the windows due to restaurant chimneys outside. Almost impossible to have a good sleep due to the noise coming from the hostel (thin doors and walls) and from the restaurant playing music till late; moreover a window on top of the door shows the corridor light each time some one passes outside. When we asked to clean the shower they didn’t solve our problem (see photo).

Parking right outside the door.

Breakfast could be earlier!	
I just wish the shared bathroom was on the same floor as the room
After more than three days of staying the same breakfast every morning becomes to be boring. 
The bed was too short, and the furnitures old, creaky.
The room itself needs some serious refurbishment 
It was a bit noisy because of the road nearby. I guess the rooms on the street side are quieter. Nevertheless, it did not prevent us from sleeping so not so bad.
Здесь уже писали: очень скрипят ручки на дверях и все проживающие ими постоянно хлопают, очень громко (но я сплю чутко). 
В доме 5 номеров: 1-й на первом этаже, 2-й и 3-й на втором этаже. Эти номера имеют свои санузлы. Также на втором этаже находятся еще 2 номера- "Дупло" и "Трипло". При заселении указали, что санузлом на первом этаже могут пользоваться только гости этих двух без номерных комнат. Но ходили еще и другие постояльцы. Немного не комфортно

2017
There were no towels in the spa.
no kitchen
Pillows are too low and no volume. As an option, there should be thicker,
Access to the Spa is outside the hotel,
Selection at breakfast
We booked this apartment mainly because of the indoor swimming pool, but the temperature was too cold for our kids to really enjoy
We were at the end of the season, without neighbors, but I'm not sure if the soundproofing is the best.
Always the recurring problem of the quality of some products at breakfast
Dark way to the Spa - outside walk
wifi problem 
The balcony door automatically locks behind you 
We used the spa which is included in the price of the stay. When we got there we walked about 15min a little bit idle because there was no one at the reception to give towels or show the facilities. When we left it was the same.
Another negative point is that unfortunately there is no connection between the hotel and the spa, so when we left the SPA we had to get rain and cold to return to the hotel.
There was an unpleasant smell in the room.
Room 216 overlooking the parking, without terrace, no mini bar, no hair dryer (the everything provided in the description) -A horrible smell comes from the pipes, smell noticed by the maids.
поблизости нет крупного супермаркета.
sauna and indoor pool were in maintenance works and there was nothing mentioned on the site.  - Oct 2019

2 single beds
Small room
The mattresses were not perfect.
Very dark rooms, old furniture, insufficient air conditioning, humidity.
There was one room that had a flood due to a problem on the roof.
Everything was a bit damp but I don't fault the place or the staff... I think its just par for the course of staying on a rainy island near the ocean.
The website shows the beautiful apartments and we had therefore booked. On the other hand, we were in a basement that was cold and unhealthy without a kitchen....

There are missing essentials in the kitchen, such as oil, tea and the like, which are not a huge expense. In the bathroom have better gel and soap. 
Bed was a little hard
Except salt, no basic food was available. It would have been nice if a bottle of water, oil and vinegar as well as spices had been available on arrival.
There was no where to put the shampoo/conditioner and soap in the shower. They do not provide soap or shampoo
We booked a stay for four nights but due to bad weather the flight was cancelled for the next day and we only enjoyed three. It cost us that the owner proved to be insensitive to our no show,

The bungalows allow you to be isolated from the rest of the complex and almost the world. Nice furniture.

There should be rolls by all the doors, and larger, to prevent wind entering the house.  - Cold?
Not having television or internet access outside of the welcoming center can be a bit rough, especially on days like my stay where it was raining really hard and not much could be done outside.
The house was full of bugs but expected given the location. The door made noise in the wind. Breakfast was full of bees in the food and space which was very uncomfortable.
A slow-flowing shower with slow-flowing water takes time for the crew to warm up,
Ants everywhere in the kitchen.
