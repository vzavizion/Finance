Pula
oRoman AmphitheatreHISTORIC BUILDING
(Arena; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Flavijevska bb; adult/concession 40/20KN; h8am-midnight Jul & Aug, to 9pm May-Jun & Sep, to 7pm Oct-Apr)
Pula’s most famous and imposing sight is this 1st-century amphitheatre, overlooking the harbour northeast of the old town. Built entirely from local limestone, the amphitheatre, known locally as the Arena, was designed to host gladiatorial contests, with seating for up to 20,000 spectators.
On the top of the walls is a gutter that collected rainwater. You can still see the slabs used to secure the fabric canopy, which protected spectators from the sun. In the chambers downstairs is a small museum with a display of ancient olive-oil equipment. Pula Film Festival is held here every summer, as are pop and classical concerts.
Check out the weekly Spectacvla Antiqva, an evening summer event that recreates gladiator fights, workshops featuring ancient Roman clothing and hairstyles and tasting of Roman food and drinks. It costs 70KN for adults, 30KN for children.
Temple of AugustusHISTORIC BUILDING
(Forum; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; adult/concession 10/5KN; h9am-10pm Mon-Fri, to 3pm Sat & Sun)
This is the only visible remnant from the Roman era on the Forum, Pula’s central meeting place from antiquity through the Middle Ages. It used to contain temples and public buildings, but today this temple, erected from 2 BC to AD 14, is the showcase. When the Romans left, it became a church and then a grain warehouse. Reconstructed after a bomb hit it in 1944, it now houses a small historical museum with captions in English.
ZerostrasseHISTORIC SITE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; adult/concession 15/5KN; h10am-10pm Jun–mid-Sep)
This underground system of tunnels was built before and during WWI to shelter the city's population and serve as storage for ammunition. Now you can walk through several of its sections, which all lead to the middle, where a photo exhibit shows early aviation in Pula. There are three entrances – one by the Forum (in a tiny unmarked street off Kandlerova), another by the Archaeological Museum and the third by the taxi stand on Giardini.
Lighting GiantsPUBLIC ART
(Pula harbour)
Don't miss Pula's latest attraction, a stunning lighting display at the city's c 1856 Uljanik shipyard, one of the world's oldest working shipyards. Renowned lighting designer Dean Skira has lit up the shipyard's iconic cranes in 16,000 different colour schemes, which come alive four times every evening on the hour, starting at 9pm for 15 minutes.
Triumphal Arch of SergiusRUIN
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Along Carrarina are Roman walls, which mark the eastern boundary of old Pula. Follow these walls south and continue down Giardini to this majestic arch erected in 27 BC to commemorate three members of the Sergius family who achieved distinction in Pula.
Museum of Contemporary Art of IstriaMUSEUM
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Ivana 1; admission 10KN; h11am-2pm & 5-9pm Tue-Sun)
Pop in to Pula's contemporary-art museum, inside the old printing house off the harbour, for a look at Istria's art from the second half of the 20th century up until today. Rotating exhibits change frequently.
CathedralCATHEDRAL
(Katedrala; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Trg Svetog Tome 2; h10am-6pm)
The main altar of Pula's 5th-century cathedral is a Roman sarcophagus holding relics of saints from the 3rd century. The floor reveals fragments of 5th- and 6th-century mosaics. Stones from the amphitheatre were used to build the bell tower in the 17th century.
Historical & Maritime Museum of IstriaMUSEUM
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Gradinski Uspon 6; adult/concession 20/10KN; h8am-9pm)
Housed in a 17th-century Venetian hilltop fortress in the old town’s centre, the meagre exhibits here deal mostly with the maritime history of Pula, but the views from the citadel walls are worth a stop.
Roman Floor MosaicHISTORIC SITE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Located just off Sergijevaca, this mosaic dates from the 3rd century. In the midst of remarkably well-preserved geometric motifs is the central panel, which depicts bad girl Dirce from Greek mythology being punished for the attempted murder of her cousin.
BEACHES

Pula is surrounded by a half-circle of rocky beaches, each one with its own fan club. Like bars or nightclubs, beaches go in and out of style. The most tourist-packed are undoubtedly those surrounding the hotel complex on the Verudela Peninsula, although some locals will dare to be seen at the small turquoise-coloured Hawaii Beach near the Hotel Park.
For seclusion, head out to the wild Rt Kamenjak (www.kamenjak.hr; pedestrians & cyclists free, per car/scooter 35/20KN; h7am-10pm) on the Premantura Peninsula, 10km south of Pula. Istria’s southernmost point, this gorgeous, entirely uninhabited cape has lovely rolling hills, wild flowers (including 30 species of orchid), low Mediterranean shrubs, fruit trees and medicinal herbs, and around 30km of virgin beaches and coves. It’s criss-crossed with a maze of gravel roads and paths, making it nice and easy to get around. The views to the island of Cres and the peaks of Velebit are extraordinary. Leave no trace – be sure to use the plastic bag and the eco-ashtray you get at the entrance for all your rubbish. Watch out for strong currents if swimming off the southern cape.
Stop by the visitor centre in the old school building in the centre of Premantura, which has an informative bilingual display about the park’s ecosystems. Nearby Windsurf Bar rents out bikes and windsurfing equipment. It also offers trial windsurfing courses.
Kolombarica Beach, on the southern end of the peninsula, is popular with daring young men who dive from the high cliffs and swim through the shallow caves at the water’s edge. Just above it is a delightful beach bar, Safari, half-hidden in the bushes near the beach, about 3.5km from the entrance to the park. A shady place with lush alcoves, lots of driftwood, found objects and a bar that serves tasty snacks, it’s a great place to while away an afternoon. For the wildest and least-discovered stretch of the cape, head to Gornji Kamenjak, which lies between the village of Volme and Premantura.
Getting to Rt Kamenjak by car is the easiest option, but drive slowly in order not to generate too much dust, which is detrimental to the environment. A more ecofriendly option is taking city bus 28 from Pula to Premantura (20KN), then renting a bike to get inside the park. On full-moon nights in summer, an organized 10km bike ride, adapted to all ages, leaves from Premantura.
2Activities
An easy 41km cycling trail from Pula to Medulin follows the path of Roman gladiators. The tourist centre can provide information on the trail, including a map.

Windsurf Bar WATER SPORTS, CYCLING
(%091 512 3646; www.windsurfing.hr; windsurfing equipment/courses per hour from 70/200KN)
In addition to windsurfing, this Premantura outfit offers cycling (250KN) and kayaking (300KN) excursions, and rents bikes (30KN per hour/100KN per day).
TTours
Every Monday evening during the high season, a guided walking tour (narrated in several languages) departs from the Arena at 8.30pm; it costs 76KN for adults and 54KN for children and lasts 1½ hours. On Wednesdays at the same time, you can do a guided two-hour gourmet tour that features traditional food and wine tastings; it costs 145KN for adults, 100KN for children. Admission for both of the above tours includes entrance to the Arena. Tickets can be bought on the spot or from travel agencies in town.
Most travel agencies offer trips to Brijuni, Limska Draga, Rovinj and inner Istria, but it’s often cheaper to book with one of the boats at the harbour. These run regularly and offer fishing picnics (220KN), two-hour ‘panorama’ excursions to Brijuni (150KN) and a jaunt to Rovinj, Limska Draga and Crveni Otok (300KN).
Only two ships go to Brijuni and actually stop and tour: Martinabela and Arena.

Rovinj (Rovigno in Italian) is coastal Istria’s star attraction. While it can get overrun with tourists in summer, and residents have developed a sharp eye for maximising profits by upgrading hotels and restaurants to four-star status, it remains one of the last true Mediterranean fishing ports. Fishers haul their catch into the harbour in the early morning, followed by a horde of squawking gulls, and mend their nets before lunch. Prayers for a good catch are sent forth at the massive Church of St Euphemia, the 60m-high tower of which punctuates the peninsula. Wooded hills and low-rise hotels surround the old town, which is webbed with steep cobbled streets and piazzas. The 14 green islands of the Rovinj archipelago make for a pleasant afternoon away; the most popular islands are Sveta Katarina and Crveni Otok (Red Island), also known as Sveti Andrija.
The old town is contained within an egg-shaped peninsula. About 1.5km south is the Punta Corrente Forest Park and the wooded cape of Zlatni Rt (Golden Cape), with its age-old oak and pine trees and several large hotels. There are two harbours: the northern open harbour and the small, protected harbour to the south.
History
Originally an island, Rovinj was settled by Slavs in the 7th century and began to develop a strong fishing and maritime industry. In 1199 Rovinj signed an important pact with Dubrovnik to protect its maritime trade, but in the 13th century the threat of piracy forced it to turn to Venice for protection.
From the 16th to 18th centuries, its population expanded dramatically with an influx of immigrants fleeing Turkish invasions of Bosnia and continental Croatia. The town began to develop outside the walls put up by the Venetians, and in 1763 the islet was connected to the mainland and Rovinj became a peninsula.
Although the town’s maritime industry thrived in the 17th century, Austria’s 1719 decision to make Trieste and Rijeka free ports dealt Rovinj a blow. The decline of sailing ships further damaged its shipbuilding industry, and in the middle of the 19th century it was supplanted by the shipyard in Pula. Like the rest of Istria, Rovinj bounced from Austrian to French to Austrian to Italian rule before finally becoming part of postwar Yugoslavia. There’s still a considerable Italian community here, who speak a particular dialect.

oChurch of St EuphemiaCHURCH
(Sveta Eufemija; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Petra Stankovića; h10am-6pm Jun-Sep, to 4pm May, to 2pm Apr)
The town’s showcase, this imposing church dominates the old town from its hilltop location in the middle of the peninsula. Built in 1736, it’s the largest baroque building in Istria, reflecting the period during the 18th century when Rovinj was its most populous town. Inside, look for the marble tomb of St Euphemia behind the right-hand altar.
Rovinj’s patron saint was tortured for her Christian faith by Emperor Diocletian before being thrown to the lions in AD 304. According to legend, the body disappeared one dark, stormy night only to appear off the coast of Rovinj in a spectral boat. The townspeople were unable to budge the heavy sarcophagus until a small boy appeared with two calves and moved it to the top of the hill, where it still stands in the present-day church. On the anniversary of her martyrdom (16 September), devotees congregate here.
Modelled on the belfry of St Mark’s in Venice, the 60m bell tower is topped by a copper statue of St Euphemia, which shows the direction of the wind by turning on a spindle. You can climb the tower (to the left of the altar) for 15KN.
Batana HouseMUSEUM
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Pina Budicina 2; adult/concession 10/5KN, with guide 15KN; h10am-2pm & 7-11pm)
On the harbour, Batana House is a museum dedicated to the batana, a flat-bottomed fishing boat that stands as a symbol of Rovinj’s seafaring and fishing traditions. The multimedia exhibits inside the 17th-century town house have interactive displays, excellent captions and audio with bitinada, which are typical fishers’ songs. Check out the spacio, the ground-floor cellar where wine was kept, tasted and sold amid much socialising (open on Tuesday and Thursday).
GrisiaSTREET
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Lined with galleries where local artists sell their work, this cobbled street leads uphill from behind the Balbi Arch to St Euphemia. The winding narrow backstreets that spread around Grisia are an attraction in themselves. Windows, balconies, portals and squares are a pleasant confusion of styles – Gothic, Renaissance, baroque and neoclassical. Notice the unique fumaioli (exterior chimneys), built during the population boom when entire families lived in a single room with a fireplace.
Punta Corrente Forest ParkPARK
(Zlatni Rt)
Follow the waterfront on foot or by bike past Hotel Park to this verdant area, locally known as Zlatni Rt, about 1.5km south. Covered in oak and pine groves and boasting 10 species of cypress, the park was established in 1890 by Baron Hütterott, an Austrian admiral who kept a villa on Crveni Otok. You can swim off the rocks or just sit and admire the offshore islands.

The elaborate Balbi Arch was built in 1679 on the location of the former town gate. The top of the arch is ornamented with a Turkish head on the outside and a Venetian head on the inside.
2Activities
Most people hop aboard a boat for swimming, snorkelling and sunbathing; boat trips across to Crveni Otok or Sveta Katarina are easily arranged through operators along the waterfront. Nadi Scuba Diving Centar (%052-813 290; www.scuba.hr) and Petra (%052-812 880; www.divingpetra.hr) offer daily boat dives. The main attraction is the Baron Gautsch wreck, an Austrian passenger steamer sunk in 1914 by a sea mine in 40m of water.
There are 80 rock-climbing routes in a former Venetian stone quarry at Punta Corrente Forest Park (Zlatni Rt), many suitable for beginners. Cycling around Rovinj and the Punta Corrente Forest Park is a superb way to spend an afternoon.
Birdwatchers can bike to the ornithological reserve at Palud Marsh, 8km southwest of Rovinj.
TTours
Most travel agencies in Rovinj sell day trips to Venice (390KN to 520KN), Plitvice (500KN to 600KN) and Brijuni (380KN to 470KN). There are also fish picnics (250KN), panoramic cruises (100KN) and boat outings to Limska Draga Fjord (150KN). These can be slightly cheaper if booked through one of the independent operators that line the waterfront.

Around Rovinj
Crveni Otok & Sveta Katarina
A popular day trip from Rovinj is a boat ride to lovely Crveni Otok (Red Island). Only 1.9km long, the island includes two islets, Sveti Andrija and Maškin, connected by a causeway. In the 19th century, Sveti Andrija became the property of Baron Hütterott, who transformed it into a luxuriantly wooded park. The Hotel Istra complex now dominates Sveti Andrija, where a playground and small gravel beaches make it popular with families. Maškin is quieter, more wooded and has plenty of secluded coves. Bring a mask for snorkelling around the rocks.
Right across the peninsula is Sveta Katarina, a small island forested by a Polish count in 1905 and now home to Hotel Katarina (%052-804 100; www.maistra.com; Otok Sveta Katarina; s/d 700/1000KN; pWs).
In summer, there are hourly boats from 5.30am till midnight to Sveta Katarina (return 30KN, 10 minutes) and to Crveni Otok (return 40KN, 15 minutes). They leave from just opposite Hotel Adriatic and also from the Delfin ferry dock near Hotel Park.
Limska Draga Fjord
About 10km long, 600m wide and with steep valley walls that rise to a height of 100m, the Limska Draga Fjord (Limski Kanal) is the most dramatic sight in Istria. The inlet was formed when the Istrian coastline sank during the last Ice Age, allowing the sea to rush in and fill the Draga Valley. The deep-green bay has a hillside cave on the southern side where the 11th-century hermit priest Romualdo lived and held ceremonies. Fishing, oyster and mussel farming and excursion boating are the only activities found here.
At the fjord you’ll find souvenir stands and two waterside restaurants that serve up superbly fresh shellfish, right from the source. Of the two, Viking (Limski Kanal 1; mains from 55KN; h11am-11pm) is the better option. Enjoy oysters (11KN per piece), great scallops (22KN per piece) and mussels, or fish (priced by the kilogram) on a terrace overlooking the fjord. There’s also a picnic area, a waterside cafe with wooden tables and chairs and a swimming cove behind the other restaurant (named Fjord).
Small excursion boats will take you on a one-hour boat ride for 75KN per person (negotiable); these run frequently in July and August, and sporadically in June and September. To get to the fjord, you can take an excursion from Rovinj, Pula or Poreč, or follow the signs to Limski Kanal past the village of Sveti Lovreč.

Buzet
Pop 6115
It may not be Istria's most fascinating town, but sleepy Buzet, 39km northeast of Poreč over the Mirna River, offers a whiff of the timeless grace of old Istria. First settled by the Romans, Buzet achieved real prominence under the Venetians, who endowed it with walls, gates and several churches. With its grey-stone buildings in various stages of decay and restoration, and the cobblestone streets nearly deserted (most of Buzet’s residents resettled at the foot of the hill in the unbecoming new part of town long ago), the old town is a quiet but charming place.
Enjoy a wander around the maze of Buzet’s narrow streets and squares, its sights all well marked with English plaques. The other reason to come here is the glorious truffle. Self-dubbed the city of truffles, Buzet takes its title seriously. Lying at the epicentre of the truffle-growing region, it offers a variety of ways to celebrate the smelly fungus, from sampling it at the old town’s restaurant to various truffle-related activities, including the Festival of Subotina.
1Sights
Most commerce is in the new Fontana section of town at the foot of the hilltop old town. If you have wheels, you must park your car by the cemetery on the hill and make the five-minute walk up to the old town.

THE TRUFFLE TRADE IN ISTRIA

The truffle trade is less like a business than a highly profitable cult. It revolves around an expensive subterranean fungus allegedly endowed with semimagical powers, which is picked in dark woods and then sent across borders to be sold for a small fortune. Devotees claim that once you’ve tasted this small, nut-shaped delicacy, all other flavours seem insipid.
There are 70 sorts of truffle in the world, of which 34 come from Europe. The traditional truffle-producing countries are Italy, France and Spain, but Istrian forests boast three sorts of black truffles as well as the big white truffle – one of the most prized in the world, at 34,000KN per kilogram. Croatia’s largest exporter of Istrian truffles is Zigante Tartufi, with its share of the overall Croatian export market being about 90%. In 1999 the company’s owner, Giancarlo Zigante, along with his dog Diana, found the world’s largest truffle in Istria, weighing 1.31kg and making it into Guinness World Records.
The Istrian truffle business is relatively young. In 1932, when Istria was occupied by Italy, an Italian soldier from the truffle capital of Alba allegedly noticed similarities in vegetation between his region and Istria. He returned after his military service with specially trained dogs, which, after enough sniffing and digging, eventually uncovered the precious commodity.
Because no sign of the truffle appears above ground, no human can spot it, so dogs (or, traditionally, pigs) are the key to a successful truffle hunt. Istrian breks (dogs) may be mongrels, but they are highly trained. Puppies begin their training at two months, but only about 20% of them go on to have fully fledged careers as truffle trackers.
The truffle-hunting season starts in early October and continues for three months, during which time at least 3000 people and 9000 to 12,000 dogs wander around the damp Motovun forests. The epicentre of the truffle-growing region is the town of Buzet.
Some people believe truffles are an aphrodisiac, though scientific research has failed to prove this. Conduct your own experiment!

Poreč
Pop 16,700
The ancient Roman town of Poreč (Parenzo in Italian; Parentium in Roman times) and the surrounding region are entirely devoted to summer tourism. Poreč is the centrepiece of a vast system of tourist resorts that stretches north and south along the west coast of Istria. The largest is Zelena Laguna, with a full range of facilities and accommodation.
These holiday villages and tourist camps offer a rather industrialised package-type experience, with too much concrete and plastic and too many tour buses for some tastes. The hotels, restaurants, tourist offices and travel agencies, however, are almost universally staffed with multilingual people who make an effort to welcome visitors.
While this is not the place for a quiet getaway (unless you come out of season), there’s a World Heritage–listed basilica, a medley of Gothic, Romanesque and baroque buildings, and well-developed tourist infrastructure, and the pristine Istrian interior is within easy reach. It's also become the party hub of Istria in the last couple of years, drawing in young partygoers from all corners of Europe and beyond.
History
The coast of Poreč measures 37km, islands included, but the ancient town is confined to a peninsula 400m long and 200m wide. The Romans conquered the region in the 2nd century BC and made Poreč an important administrative centre, from which they were able to control a sweep of land from the Limska Draga Fjord to the Mirna River. Poreč’s street plan was laid out by the Romans, who divided the town into rectangular parcels marked by the longitudinal Decumanus and the latitudinal Cardo.
With the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, Poreč came under Byzantine rule between the 6th and 8th centuries. It was during this time that the Euphrasian Basilica, with its magnificent frescoes, was erected. In 1267 Poreč was forced to submit to Venetian rule.
With the decline of Venice, the town oscillated between Austrian and French dominance before the Italian occupation that lasted from 1918 to 1943. Upon the capitulation of Italy, Poreč was occupied by the Germans and damaged by Allied bombing in 1944 before becoming part of postwar Yugoslavia and, more recently, Croatia.

The compact old town is squeezed onto the peninsula and packed with hundreds of shops and agencies. The ancient Roman Decumanus, with its polished stones, is still the main street running through the peninsula’s middle. Hotels, travel agencies and excursion boats are on the quayside Maršala Tita, which runs from the small-boat harbour to the tip of the peninsula.
oEuphrasian BasilicaBASILICA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Eufrazijeva bb; adult/concession 40/20KN; h9am-6pm Mon-Sat, 2-6pm Sun Apr-Sep)
The main reason to visit Poreč is to see the 6th-century Euphrasian Basilica, a World Heritage Site and one of Europe’s finest intact examples of Byzantine art. Built on the site of a 4th-century oratory, the sacral complex includes a church, an atrium and a baptistery. What packs in the crowds are the glittering wall mosaics in the apse. These 6th-century masterpieces feature biblical scenes, archangels and Istrian martyrs.
Notice the group to the left, which shows Bishop Euphrasius, who commissioned the basilica, with a model of the church in his hand. The belfry, accessed through the octagonal baptistery, affords an invigorating view of the old town. Make sure to pop into the adjacent Bishop's Palace, which contains a display of ancient stone sculptures, religious paintings and 4th-century mosaics from the original oratory.
Trg MaraforSQUARE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
The Roman Forum, where public gatherings took place, once stood on the site of the present-day Trg Marafor. The original pavement has been preserved along the northern row of houses on the square. West of this rectangular square, inside a small park, are the ruins of the 2nd-century Temple of Neptune ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), dedicated to the god of the sea.
Venetian TowersRUIN
The town has three 15th-century towers that date from the Venetian rule and once formed the city walls: the gothic Pentagonal Tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) at the beginning of Decumanus; the Round Tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) on Narodni trg; and the Northern Tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) on Peškera Bay.
Sveti NikolaISLAND
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
On this small island that lies opposite Poreč harbour, there are pebble and concrete beaches to choose from, as well as rocky breakwaters, shady pine forests and great views of the town across the way. From May to October there are passenger boats (adult/concession 20/10KN) travelling to Sveti Nikola. They depart every 30 minutes (from 6.45am to 1am) from the wharf on Maršala Tita.
2Activities
Nearly every activity you might want to enjoy is on offer outside the town in either Plava Laguna or Zelena Laguna. Most of the sports and recreational centres (there are 20) are affiliated with hotels and have tennis, basketball and volleyball courts, windsurfing, rowing, bungee jumping, paintball, golf, waterskiing, parasailing, boat rentals, go-karting and canoeing. If the weather turns bad, you can always work out in a fitness centre or get a massage at one of the spas. For details, pick up the annual Poreč Info & Events booklet, which lists all the recreational facilities in the area, from the tourist office.
The gentle rolling hills of the interior and the well-marked paths make cycling and hiking prime ways to explore the region. The tourist office issues a free map of roads and trails stemming from Poreč, along with suggested routes. You can rent a bike at many agencies around town.
There is good diving in and around shoals and sandbanks in the area, as well as at the nearby Coriolanus, a British Royal Navy warship that sank in 1945. At Diving Centre Poreč (%052-433 606; www.divingcenter-porec.com), boat dives start at 135KN (more for caves or wrecks) or 355KN with full equipment rental.

Motovun
Pop 480
Motovun is a captivating little town perched on a 277m hill in the Mirna River Valley, about 25km northeast of Poreč. It was the Venetians who decided to fortify the town in the 14th century, building two sets of thick walls.
There are a number of galleries and shops before you enter the old town and between the town gates, including a wine-tasting shop and a Zigante food store. Within the walls, an atmospheric cluster of Romanesque and Gothic buildings houses a smattering of artist studios. Newer houses have sprung up on the slopes leading to the old town, where the popular film festival takes place every summer – the very film fest that has, in recent years, made Motovun the most touristy of Istria's hilltop towns.
A Venetian lion scowls down from the outer gate, beyond which sprawls a terrace with a baroque loggia and a cafe’s outside tables, perfect for watching the sun go down below the valley. A cheerier lion adorns the inner gate, which holds a long-running restaurant. Inside is a tree-shaded square with the town’s hotel, an old well and the Church of St Stephen.
1Sights & Activities
Church of St StephenCHURCH
(Svetog Stjepana; Trg Andrea Antico)
The town highlight is the Renaissance Church of St Stephen. Designed by Venetian artist Andrea Palladio, the interior is currently under renovation and opening hours are sporadic. Along the inner wall that encloses the old town rises a 16th-century bell tower.

Be sure to walk on the outer walls of the ramparts for memorable vistas over vineyards, fields and oak woods below. Take a break in the hidden cafe on the city walls, by the post office.

The recently revived route takes visitors along the old Parenzana train line from Motovun to the scenic hill town of Vižinada above the Mirna River valley. The ride stops in the village of Ratokule, where you taste homemade Istrian treats from a local farm. There are five daily departures; the trip lasts one hour and 40 minutes; you can return for free. The trip can also be done from Vižinada to Motovun.


Istarske Toplice
Istarske TopliceSPA
(www.istarske-toplice.hr)
Dating from the Roman era, Istarske Toplice is one of Croatia’s oldest, most scenic thermal spas. Beneath an 85m-high cliff and surrounded by greenery, the complex features a concrete-box-style hotel, a wellness centre and, like most spas in Croatia, a slightly geriatric touch. The rotten-egg smell is from the high sulphur content of the large pool, where temperatures reach 34°C.
It's not worth spending the night (unless you love spas), but come for a few hours to indulge. The treatments menu is wide and varied, and includes anything from from hot stone (350KN for 1¼ hours) to signature body treatments with wine, honey and lavender (330KN each). Or simply spend time paddling around in the thermal pool (40KN for three hours) or sweating it all away in the sauna (170KN for three hours). The thermal waters are said to help rheumatism, skin diseases and respiratory tract disorders.
There’s no public transport, but the spa is easily accessible by road, 10km north of Motovun and 11km south of Buzet on the main road that connects the two towns.



Grožnjan
Pop 160
Until the mid-1960s, Grožnjan, 27km northeast of Poreč, was slipping towards oblivion. First mentioned in 1102, this hilltop town was a strategically important fortress for the 14th-century Venetians. They created a system of ramparts and gates, and built a loggia, a granary and several fine churches. With the collapse of the Venetian empire in the 18th century, Grožnjan suffered a decline in its importance and population.
In 1965 sculptor Aleksandar Rukavina and a small group of other artists ‘discovered’ the crumbling medieval appeal of Grožnjan and began setting up studios in the abandoned buildings. As the town crawled back to life, it attracted the attention of Jeunesses Musicales International, an international training program for young musicians. In 1969 a summer school for musicians was established in Grožnjan and it has been going strong ever since. Each year there are music, orchestra and ballet courses and recitals, with musical events almost daily throughout summer. You can hear the musicians practising while you browse the many craft shops and galleries of this tiny town, comprised of a jumble of crooked lanes and leafy squares.
1Sights & Activities
All the town's sights are marked with plaques that have English explanations. The Renaissance loggia is immediately to the right of the town gate by the tourist office. Keep going and on your right you’ll see the baroque Spinotti Morteani Palace, its patio overtaken by the outdoor tables of the Zigante Tartufi (www.zigantetartufi.com; Umberta Gorjana 5; h9am-10pm) shop. Next on the right comes the Kaštel (castle), where many concerts are held.
The town is dominated by the yellow sandstone bell tower of the Church of St Vitus, St Modest & St Crescentia, which was built in the 14th century and renovated in baroque style in 1770.
There are more than 30 galleries and studios scattered around town; most are open daily from May to September. Fonticus Gallery (Gradska Galerija Fonticus; Trg Lođe 3; h10am-1pm & 5-8pm Tue-Sun) promotes recent work of mainly Croatian artists. It doesn’t have a permanent collection but does host a small display of heraldic paraphernalia that includes helmets, insignia and

ISTRIA’S DIVERSE HIDEAWAYS

Istria has many more highlights for those willing to explore. Here’s a rundown.
Novigrad is an attractive old town crammed onto a peninsula, only 20 minutes (18km) north of Poreč. It has one of Istria’s best restaurants, Damir & Ornella (%052-758 134; www.damirornella.com; Zidine 5; mains from 70KN; h12.30-3.30pm & 7.30-11.30pm), a 28-seat tavern famous for its raw-fish specialities. The Mediterranean-style sashimi is to die for; reserve ahead. On par is Marina (Antona 38; mains from 80KN; hnoon-3pm & 6-11pm), a restaurant headed up by one of Croatia's best chefs, Marina Gaši, who whips up playful versions of Croatia's mainstays in this contemporary space right by the marina. The six-course tasting menu (370KN) is worth the splurge.
The fishing village of Savudrija is Croatia’s westernmost point and home to Istria’s oldest lighthouse (www.lighthouses-croatia.com), built in 1818. The lighthouse is now available for weekly rental (5312KN per week for two people).
Vrsar, located roughly between Rovinj and Poreč, is a delightful fishing town rising on a hilltop in a jumble of medieval buildings. It’s quieter than its neighbours and has an outdoor sculpture park featuring the work of renowned Croatian sculptor Dušan Džamonja. The story goes that Casanova frequented Vrsar back in the day, which the town today celebrates each June during Casanovafest (www.casanovafest.com; hJun), the Love and Erotica Festival.
Also within easy reach of Poreč is the Baredine Cave (www.baredine.com; adult/concession/children 6-12 60/45/35KN; h9.30am-6pm Jul & Aug, 10am-5pm May, Jun & Sep, 10am-4pm Oct & Apr), the subterranean chambers of which are replete with stalagmites and stalactites; various agencies offer excursions.
In the interior, art aficionados should head to Beram, near Pazin, to take in the amazing 15th-century frescoes in the Church of St Mary of Škriljine; the Pazin tourist office has details. Vela Vrata (mains from 40KN; h1-11pm), the village konoba (tavern), serves great homemade pastas, good meat and mean crêpes with skuta (ricotta) and honey, paired with leafy views.
Near Labin is Istria’s youngest town, Raša, a showcase of modernist functionalist architecture that sprang up under Mussolini’s rule in the 1930s. Nearby, in the fishing village of Trget, wrapped around a small bay, is one of Istria's best seafood restaurants, Martin Pescador (Trget 11a; mains from 45KN; hnoon-11pm). This Istrian konoba, right on the water, with a boat-shaped bar inside and a lovely terrace right on the sea, serves a mean fish soup and excellent seafood.
On a hilltop north of Motovun is Oprtalj, less developed than its neighbour, with cypress trees and fantastic views of the surrounding scenery. Four kilometres to the southeast, amid scenic hills, is the gorgeous Ipša Estate (%052-664 010; www.ipsa-maslinovaulja.hr), worth a visit for the taste of its award-winning olive oils; call ahead.
Foodies shouldn't miss the scenic village of Zrenj northeast of Oprtalj, which has a couple of top eating choices where Istrian farm food is concerned. For a light meal of truffle-infused antipastos served with homemade bread, like cheese drowned in olive oil, truffles and butter, Istrian prosciutto and truffle fritaja (omelette), look no further than Agroturizam Nežić (%052-644 285; Zrenj 11; mains from 50KN; hSundays only). The farm owners Paolo and Nadia serve up these lovingly prepared snacks on Sundays in their traditional stone tavern; be sure to call ahead. For a more solid meal featuring the best lamb and potatoes under peka (a domed baking lid), head to the renowned Agroturizam Tončić (%052-644 146; www.agroturizam-toncic.com; Čabarnica 42, Zrenj; mains from 50KN; hweekends only) at the end of the village, where tasty food is dished out in the rustic interior or on the terrace with stunning views of Čićarija mountains. Try the cumin rakija (grappa) and ask to see their farm animals. Reserve ahead, as it's hugely popular and sometimes receives big groups.
