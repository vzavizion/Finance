		Novoslobodskaya is enveloped in the art-nouveau artistry of 32 stained-glass panels. Six windows depict the so-called intellectual professions: architect, geographer, agronomist, engineer, artist and musician. At one end of the central hall is the mosaic Peace in the Whole World. The pair of white doves was a later addition to the mosaic, replacing a portrait of Stalin
		Mayakovskaya is the pièce de résistance of the Moscow metro. The grand-prize winner at the 1938 World’s Fair in New York has an art-deco central hall that’s all pink rhodonite, with slender, steel columns. The inspiring, upward-looking mosaics on the ceiling depict 24 Hours in the Land of the Soviets. This is also one of the deepest stations (33m), which allowed it to serve as an air-raid shelter during WWII

Four Seasons Moscow (from outside)
	unusual Four Seasons Moscow exhibits two contrasting architectural styles, thanks to a funny fluke of history. The story goes that Stalin was shown two possible designs for the Hotel Moskva on Manezhnaya pl. Not realising they were alternatives, he approved both. The builders did not dare point out his error, and so built half the hotel in constructivist style and half in Stalinist style. The current building is a recreation of the 1935 original

Red Square

		come back at night, when the crowds are gone and the lights cast a magical glow on the historic buildings
		
		
	Resurrection Gate aka Воскресенские ворота
		great vantage point for the first glimpse of the Red Square
		
		twin red towers topped by green tent spires, the original 1680 gateway was destroyed because Stalin thought it an impediment to the parades and demonstrations held in Red Square. This exact replica was built in 1995
		
		just outside the gateway is the bright Chapel of the Iverian Virgin, originally built in the late 18th century to house the icon of the same name		
		
	towers
		Saviour Gate Tower aka Спасская башня
			clock tower soaring above Red Square
			
			this gate – considered sacred – has been used for processions since tsarist times. The two white-stone plaques above the gate commemorate the tower’s construction in 1491. The current clock was installed in the gate tower in the 1850s. Hauling 3m-long hands and weighing 25 tonnes, the clock takes up three of the tower’s 10 levels. Its melodic chime sounds every 15 minutes across Red Square			
			
		Tsar Tower
			legend has it that Ivan the Terrible watched executions and other Red Square activities from the old wooden tower that previously stood on this site
			
		Alarm Tower aka Набатная башня
			used to house the Spassky Alarm Bell, used to warn of enemy attacks and to spur popular uprisings. After quashing one such uprising, Catherine the Great was so outraged that she had the clapper removed from the bell, so it could sound no more		

	Place of Skulls aka Лобное место
		13m circular stone platform in front of St Basil's Cathedral is known as the Place of Skulls. Legend has it that it was the site of executions; in reality, it was a stage for tsarist decrees and religious ceremonies
			
				

	
!!!
Alexander Garden aka Александровский сад
	first public park in Moscow		
		back in the 17th century, the Neglinnaya River ran through the present gardens, with dams and mills along its banks. When the river was diverted underground, the garden was founded by architect Osip Bove, in 1821
		
	impressive Kremlin views
	
	every hour on the hour, the guards of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier perform a perfectly synchronised ceremony to change the guards on duty

	obelisk in Alexander Garden has been restored to its original purpose, as a monument to the House of Romanovs, originally erected to commemorate the tercentenary of the royal family's rule. In 1918 it had a dramatic change in mission when it was recast as a monument to honour 'outstanding thinkers in the struggle for the liberation of workers'. Nearly 100 years later – revolutionary thinking no longer deserving of memorialising – a replica of the original Romanovsky obelisk was restored, this time to celebrate the Romanovs' 400th anniversary

			main visitors’ entrance

			stands apart from the Kremlin’s west wall, at the end of a ramp over the Alexander Garden. The ramp was once a bridge over the Neglinnaya River and used to be part of the Kremlin’s defences; this river has been diverted underground, beneath the Alexander Garden, since the early 19th century. The Kutafya Tower is the last of a number of outer bridge towers that once stood on this side of the Kremlin

		Troitskaya Tower aka Trinity Gate Tower
			pass through the Kremlin walls

			from the Kutafya Tower, walk up the ramp and pass through the Kremlin walls beneath the 1495 Trinity Gate Tower. At 80m it's the tallest of the Kremlin’s towers. Right below your feet were the cells for prisoners in the 16th century
	
	!!!	
	Armoury aka Оружейная палата
		highlight of any visit to the Kremlin
		
		housed in Great Kremlin Palace
		dates back to 1511, when it was founded under Vasily III to manufacture and store weapons, imperial arms and regalia for the royal court, also produced jewellery, icon frames and embroidery		
		during the reign of Peter the Great all craftspeople, goldsmiths and silversmiths were sent to St Petersburg, and the Armoury became a mere museum storing the royal treasures

		tour - 1hr
			tour starts upstairs, where the first two rooms house gold and silver from the 12th to 20th centuries, many of which were crafted in the Kremlin workshops. There's jewellery, dishes and sacred items crafted from precious metals and jewels
			
			in Room 2, you'll find the renowned Easter eggs made by St Petersburg jeweller Fabergé. The tsar and tsarina traditionally exchanged these gifts each year at Easter. Most famous is the Grand Siberian Railway egg, with gold train, platinum locomotive and ruby headlamp, created to commemorate the Moscow–Vladivostok line
			
			following rooms display armour, weapons and more armour and more weapons. Don’t miss the helmet of Prince Yaroslav, the chainmail of Boris Godunov, and the sabres of Minin and Pozharsky
			
			downstairs in Room 6, you can see the coronation dresses of 18th-century empresses (Empress Elizabeth, we’re told, had 15,000 other dresses). Look for Catherine the Great's wedding gown, which is covered with silver brocade (note the 43cm waist size!). Other 'secular' clothing is also on display, including an impressive pair of boots that belonged to Peter the Great
			
			following room contains some impressive furniture, including the 800-diamond throne of Tsar Alexey. The most unusual item, perhaps, is the joint coronation throne of boy tsars Peter the Great and his half-brother Ivan V (with a secret compartment from which Regent Sofia prompted them). In the same room, you'll see the glittering and fur-lined crowns of the emperors through the ages. The gold Cap of Monomakh, jewel-studded and sable-trimmed, was used for two centuries at coronations

			end your tour in Room 9, which houses centuries’ worth of royal carriages and sledges. One of the oldest is the luxurious carriage that was a gift from King James of England to Boris Godunov in 1604. Look also for the sleigh in which Elizabeth rode from St Petersburg to Moscow for her coronation, pulled by 23 horses at a time – about 800 in all for the trip
	
	Diamond Fund aka Алмазный фонд		
		can be skipped as Armoury also has diamond exposition		
			managed by the Ministry of Finance, which retains a monopoly on the mining and sale of precious stones. As such, the collection includes many magnificent raw diamonds, some in excess of 300 carats
		security is super tight and you are not allowed to bring cameras, phones or bags of any sort
		dates back to 1719, when Peter the Great established the Russian Crown treasury
			bulk of the exhibit is gemstones and jewellery garnered by tsars and empresses
				190-carat diamond given to Catherine the Great by her lover Grigory Orlov
				Great Imperial Crown, encrusted with 4936 diamonds, was the coronation crown of Catherine the Great and successive rulers
		
	???
	Patriach's Palace and Church of the Twelve Apostles
		mostly built in the mid-17th century for Patriarch Nikon, whose reforms sparked the break with the Old Believers
		highlight is the ceremonial Cross Hall (Крестовая палата), where the tsar’s and ambassadorial feasts were held. From the 18th century the room was used to produce miro (a holy oil used during church services, which contains over 30 herbal components); the oven and huge pans from the production process are on display
		palace now contains an exhibit of 17th-century household items, including jewellery, hunting equipment and furniture
		from here you can access the five-domed Church of the Twelve Apostles, which has a gilded, wooden iconostasis and a collection of icons by leading 17th-century icon painters
		
	Assumption Cathedral aka Успенский собор
		focal church of prerevolutionary Russia
			striking 1660s fresco of the Virgin Mary faces Sobornaya pl, above the door once used for royal processions
		if you have limited time, come straight here
		visitors entrance is at the western end
		
		history
			In 1470 Russian architects Krivtsov and Myshkin were commissioned by Ivan the Great to replace the old dilapidated cathedral, which dated from 1326. As soon as the ceiling was put up, one of the walls collapsed. Krivtsov and Myshkin lost their jobs, and Italian architect Aristotle Fioravanti was given a crack at it. After the foundation was completed, Fioravanti toured Novgorod, Suzdal and Vladimir to acquaint himself with Russian architecture. His design is a more spacious version of the Assumption Cathedral at Vladimir, with a Renaissance twist
			
			in 1812 French troops used the Assumption Cathedral as a stable; they also looted 295kg of gold and over 5 tonnes of silver from here, but much of it was recovered

			church closed in 1918. According to some accounts, in 1941, when the Nazis were on the outskirts of Moscow, Stalin secretly ordered a service in the cathedral to protect the city from the enemy. The cathedral was officially returned to the Church in 1989, but it now operates as a museum

		frescoes & murals
			The interior of the Assumption Cathedral is unusually bright and spacious, full of frescoes painted in warm golds, reds and blues. The west wall features a scene of the Apocalypse, a favourite theme of the Russian Church in the Middle Ages. The pillars have pictures of martyrs, considered to be the pillars of faith. Above the southern gates there are frescoes of Yelena and Constantine, who brought Christianity to Greece and the south of Russia. The space above the northern gate depicts Olga and Vladimir, who brought Christianity to the north.
			
			Most of the existing images on the cathedral walls were painted on a gilt base in the 1640s, with the exception of three grouped together on the south wall: The Apocalypse (Апокалипсис), The Life of Metropolitan Pyotr (Житие Митрополита Петра) and All Creatures Rejoice in Thee (О тебе радуется). These are attributed to Dionysius and his followers, the cathedral’s original 15th-century mural painters.

		Throne of Monomakh
			Near the south wall, the tent-roofed wooden throne is known as the Throne of Monomakh. It was made in 1551 for Ivan the Terrible. Its carved scenes highlight the career of 12th-century Grand Prince Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev – considered to be Ivan's direct predecessor.

		Iconostasis
			iconostasis dates from 1652, but its lowest level contains some older icons. The 1340s Saviour with the Angry Eye (Спас Ярое око) is second from the right. On the left of the central door is the Virgin of Vladimir (Владимирская Богоматерь), an early-15th-century Rublyov-school copy of Russia’s most revered image, the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God (Владимирская икона Богоматери). The 12th-century original, now in Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery, stood in the Assumption Cathedral from the 1480s to 1930. One of the oldest Russian icons, the 12th-century red-clothed St George (Святой Георгий) from Novgorod, is by the north wall.

			The original icons of the lower, local tier are symbols of victory brought from Vladimir, Smolensk, Veliky Ustyug and other places. The south door was brought from the Nativity of the Virgin Cathedral in Suzdal.		

	Archangel Cathedral
		coronation, wedding and burial church of tsars
		built by Ivan Kalita in 1333 to commemorate the end of the great famine, and dedicated to Archangel Michael, guardian of the Moscow princes		
		
		tombs of almost all Muscovy’s rulers from the 1320s to the 1690s are here. The only absentee is Boris Godunov, whose body was taken out of the grave on the order of a ‘False Dmitry’ and buried at Sergiev Posad in 1606. The bodies are buried underground, beneath the 17th-century sarcophagi and 19th-century copper covers. Tsarevitch Dmitry (a son of Ivan the Terrible), who died mysteriously in 1591, lies beneath a painted stone canopy. It was Dmitry’s death that sparked the appearance of a string of impersonators, known as False Dmitrys, during the Time of Troubles. Ivan’s own tomb is out of sight behind the iconostasis, along with those of his other sons, Ivan (whom he killed) and Fyodor I (who succeeded him). From Peter the Great onwards, emperors and empresses were buried in St Petersburg, the exception being Peter II, who died in Moscow and is here.

		some 17th-century murals were uncovered during restorations of the Archangel Cathedral in the 1950s. The south wall depicts many of the rulers buried here; on the pillars are some of their predecessors, including Andrei Bogolyubsky, Prince Daniil and Alexander Nevsky		
		
	Annunciation Cathedral aka Благовещенский собор
		royal family’s private chapel
			under Orthodox law, the fourth marriage of Ivan the Terrible disqualified him from entering the church proper, so he had the southern gallery of the Annunciation Cathedral converted into the Archangel Gabriel Chapel, from where he could watch services through a grille
		impressive murals in the gallery			
			many murals in the gallery date from the 1560s. Among them are Capture of Jericho in the northern porch, Jonah and the Whale in the northern arm of the gallery and the Tree of Jesus on its ceiling. Other frescoes feature ancient philosophers such as Aristotle, Plutarch, Plato and Socrates holding scrolls inscribed with their own wise words. Socrates’ scroll reads: ‘No harm will ever come to a good man. Our soul is immortal. After death the good shall be rewarded and the evil punished.' Plato’s says: ‘We must hope God shall send us a heavenly Teacher and a Guide’.
		central chapel features the celebrated icons of master painters Theophanes the Greek and Andrei Rublyov
		small central part of the cathedral has a lovely jasper floor
		iconostasis
			real treasure - in the 1920s restorers uncovered early-15th-century icons by three of the greatest medieval Russian artists. It was most likely Theophanes who painted the six icons at the right-hand end of the biggest row of the six tiers of the iconostasis. From left to right, these are the Virgin Mary, Christ Enthroned, St John the Baptist, the Archangel Gabriel, the Apostle Paul and St John Chrysostom. Theophanes was a master of portraying pathos in the facial expressions of his subjects, setting these icons apart from most others.
			third icon from the left, Archangel Michael, is ascribed to Andrei Rublyov, who may also have painted the adjacent St Peter. Rublyov is also reckoned to be the artist of the first, second, sixth and seventh (and probably the third and fifth) icons from the left end of the festival row, above the deesis (biggest) row. The seven icons at the right-hand end are attributed to Prokhor of Gorodets
		archaeology exhibit in the basement
			remnant of the 14th-century church that previously occupied this site. On display are hundreds of artefacts – glassware, ceramics, tools and woodwork – that were excavated from Borovitsky Hill in the 1960s and 1970s
			
	Sobornaya pl
		every Saturday at noon from April to October, the Presidential Regiment shows up on Sobornaya pl for a ceremonial procession, featuring some very official-looking prancing and dancing, both on foot and on horseback			
	
	Ivan the Great Bell Tower
		before the 20th century it was forbidden to build any higher in Moscow
		climb the 137 steps to the top for sweeping views
			45-minute audio tour ends with a 137-step climb to the top of the tall tower, yielding an amazing (and unique!) view of Sobornaya pl, with the Church of Christ the Saviour and the Moskva-City skyscrapers in the distance
		
		in 1505, Italian Marco Bono designed a new belfry, originally with only two octagonal tiers beneath a drum and a dome. In 1600 Boris Godunov raised it to 81m (local legend says that this was a public works project designed to employ the thousands of people who had come to Moscow during a famine)
		building’s central section, with a gilded single dome holds 65-tonne bell
		
		exhibition
			houses a multimedia presentation of the architectural history of the Kremlin complex - illustrates how the Kremlin has changed since the 12th century
		
	Tsar Bell

		earlier version, weighing 130 tonnes, fell from belfry during a fire in 1701 and shattered. Using these remains, the current Tsar Bell was cast in the 1730s for Empress Anna Ivanovna. The bell was cooling off in the foundry casting pit in 1737 when it came into contact with water, causing an 11-tonne chunk to break off. One hundred years later, the architect Montferrand took the damaged bell out of the pit and put it on a pedestal. Bas-reliefs of Empress Anna and Tsar Alexey, as well as some icons, were etched on its sides

	History
		A 'kremlin' – or fortified stronghold – has existed on this site since Moscow’s earliest years. In 1147 Yury Dolgoruky summoned his allies to this spot, which would have been occupied by a wooden fort. When the city became the capital of medieval Rus in the 1320s, the Kremlin served as the headquarters of the Russian Orthodox Church and the seat of the prince
		
		The ambition of Ivan III (the Great) was to build a capital that would equal the fallen Constantinople in grandeur, power, achievements and architecture. In an effort to build the ‘Third Rome’, Ivan brought from Italy stonemasons and architects, who built new walls, three great cathedrals and other structures. Most of the present-day buildings date from this period
			
		Although Peter I (the Great) shifted the capital to St Petersburg, the tsars still showed up here for coronations and other celebrations. The fortress was captured by Napoleon, who inflicted serious damage before making his retreat in 1812. But still the ancient symbol endured. The citadel wouldn’t be breached again until the Bolsheviks stormed the place in November 1917

St Basil’s Cathedral

	R400
	audio guide R200
	
	11am-6pm


	in 1552 Ivan the Terrible captured the Tatar stronghold of Kazan on the Feast of Intercession. He commissioned this landmark church, officially the Intercession Cathedral, to commemorate the victory
	
	official name of St Basil’s Cathedral is the Intercession Cathedral. The misnomer ‘St Basil’s’ refers to the extra northeastern chapel, which was built over the grave of Vasily (Basil) the Blessed
	
	legend has it that Ivan had the architects blinded so that they could never build anything comparable. This is a myth, however, as records show that they were employed a quarter of a century later (and four years after Ivan’s death) to add an additional chapel to the structure
	
	out front of St Basil’s is a statue of Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky, one a butcher and the other a prince, who raised and led the army that ejected occupying Poles from the Kremlin in 1612

	
	Don't miss
		Church of St Vasily the Blessed
		Portals from the vestry to the central church
		Icon of the Old Testament Trinity
		Icon of the Life of St Alexander Nevsky

		
	Exterior
		cathedral’s apparent anarchy of shapes hides a comprehensible plan of nine main chapels
		
		tall, tent-roofed tower in the centre houses the namesake Church of the Intercession of the Mother of God

		four biggest domes top four octagonal-towered chapels
			Church of Sts Cyprian & Justina
			Church of the Holy Trinity
			Church of the Icon of St Nicholas the Miracle Worker
			Church of the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem
			
			there are four smaller chapels in between, each consecrated in honour of an event or battle in the struggle against Kazan
		
		onion domes were originally green, most likely acquiring their characteristic colours and patterns during an 18th-century restoration
	
	
	Church of St Vasily the Blessed
		The Church of St Vasily the Blessed, the northeastern chapel on the ground floor, contains the canopy-covered crypt of its namesake saint, one of the most revered in Moscow. Vasily (Basil) the Blessed was known as a 'holy fool', sometimes going naked and purposefully humiliating himself for the greater glory of God. He was believed to be a seer and miracle maker, and even Ivan the Terrible revered and feared him. This 10th chapel – the only one at ground level – was added in 1588, after the saint's death. Look for the icon depicting St Vasily himself, with Red Square and the Kremlin in the background

	Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God
		The tall, tent-roofed tower in the centre of the cathedral houses the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God. The ceiling soars to nearly 47m. Some of the walls have been restored to their original appearance (a painted red-brick pattern), while others show off fragments of oil murals that were painted later. From the vestry, the doorways into this central chapel are among the most elaborate architectural elements in the cathedral, gorgeously embellished with tile and brickwork

	Church of the Holy Trinity
		With whitewashed walls and a spiralling symbol of eternity painted in the vault, the light-filled Church of the Holy Trinity is a favourite. A gorgeous 16th-century chandelier is suspended from the 20m ceiling. But the gem of the room is the unusual iconostasis. The 16th-century Icon of the Old Testament Trinity in the third tier is among the oldest and most esteemed pieces of artwork in the cathedral

	Church of St Cyprian & St Justina
		The colourful Church of Sts Cyprian & Justina is adorned with oil paintings depicting the lives of the 4th-century saints, as well as Biblical stories. At 20m, the vault in the dome depicts the Mother of God of the Burning Bush. The paintings and the iconostasis date to the end of the 18th century

	Church of the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem
		This chapel is dedicated to the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem, also known in Orthodoxy as Willow Sunday. At 23m, this is one of the tallest towers in the cathedral. Whitewashed walls (as originally painted) show off the architectural elements. Above the northern entrance, you can see the scar left by a shell that hit the wall in October 1917. The iconostasis was moved from the Cathedral of St Alexander Nevsky in the Kremlin in 1770. One of the most sacred and revered pieces in the cathedral is the 17th-century icon of the Life of St Alexander Nevsky, which depicts 33 scenes from the saint's life

He falls ill during the voyage and is near death when he finds his love. The princess embraces him, but he dies in her arms. Naturally, the princess reacts to his death by renouncing her worldly life. The ceramic panels were made at the pottery workshop at Savva Mamontov’s estate in Abramtsevo
			
		ceramic work on the side of the hotel facing Teatralnaya pl is by the artist Alexander Golovin. The script was originally a quote from Nietzsche: ‘Again the same story: when you build a house you notice that you have learned something’. During the Soviet era, these wise words were replaced with something more appropriate for the time: ‘Only the dictatorship of the proletariat can liberate mankind from the oppression of capitalism’. Lenin, of course

History
It was Peter the Great’s desire to make Russia a major European power that led to the founding of St Petersburg. At the start of the Great Northern War (1700–21), he captured the Swedish outposts on the Neva, and in 1703 he began the construction of his city with the Peter & Paul Fortress.
After Peter trounced the Swedes at Poltava in 1709, the city he named Sankt Pieter Burch (in Dutch style, after his namesake) really began to grow. In 1712 Peter moved the capital from Moscow to this still embryonic site, drafting in armies of peasants and Swedish prisoners of war to work as forced labour. Many died of disease and exhaustion, and St Petersburg is still known as ‘a city built upon bones’ to many Russians. Architects and artisans came to St Petersburg from all over Europe though, and by Peter’s death in 1725 the city had a population of 40,000 and some 90% of Russia’s foreign trade passed through it.
Between 1741 and 1825, during the reigns of Empress Elizabeth, Catherine the Great and Alexander I, St Petersburg became a cosmopolitan city with an imperial court of famed splendour. These monarchs commissioned glittering palaces, government buildings and grand churches.
Revolution & War
The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 and industrialisation, which peaked in the 1890s, brought a flood of workers into the city, leading to squalor, disease and festering discontent. St Petersburg became a hotbed of strikes and political violence, and was the hub of the 1905 revolution, sparked by ‘Bloody Sunday’ on 9 January 1905, when a strikers’ march to petition the tsar in the Winter Palace was fired on by troops. In 1914, in a wave of patriotism at the start of WWI, the city’s name was changed to the Russian-style Petrograd.
In 1917 the workers’ protests turned into a general strike and troops mutinied, forcing the end of the monarchy in March and the establishment of a provisional government. Seven months later, Lenin’s Bolshevik Party staged an audacious coup and the Soviet government came into being. Fearing a German attack on Petrograd, the new government moved the capital back to Moscow in March 1918.
Renamed Leningrad after Lenin’s death in 1924, the city became a hub of Stalin’s 1930s industrialisation program. By 1939 its population had grown to 3.1 million and it accounted for 11% of Soviet industrial output. Stalin feared the city as a rival powerbase, however, and the 1934 assassination of the local communist chief Sergei Kirov at the Smolny Institute was the start of his 1930s Communist Party purge.
When Germany attacked the USSR in June 1941, its armies took only 2 1/2 months to reach Leningrad. It was the birthplace of Bolshevism, and Hitler swore to wipe the city from the face of the earth. His troops besieged the city in what would become the defining event of the 20th century for St Petersburg. Around a million people died from shelling, starvation and disease in what’s often called the ‘900 Days’ (actually 872). By comparison, the USA and UK suffered about 700,000 dead between them in total for the whole of WWII. Leningrad survived and, after the war, was proclaimed a ‘hero city’.
St Petersburg Again
During the 1960s and ’70s, Leningrad developed a reputation as a dissident’s city with an artistic underground spearheaded by the poet Joseph Brodsky and, later, rock groups such as Akvarium. In 1989 Anatoly Sobchak, a reform-minded candidate, was elected mayor. Two years later, as the USSR crumbled, the city’s citizens voted to bring back the name of St Petersburg (though the region around the city remains known as Leningradskaya Oblast).
In the anarchic post-Soviet years of the early 1990s, it often seemed like the local ‘Mafia’ were more in charge than the city’s elected officials, who proved to be equally corrupt. Romanov ghosts returned to the city on 17 July 1998, when the remains of Tsar Nicholas II and some of his family were buried in the crypt at the SS Peter & Paul Cathedral within the fortress of the same name.
Five years later enormous sums were budgeted to spruce up the city for its tercentenary celebrations. Local boy made good Vladimir Putin didn’t waste the opportunity to return to his birthplace and show it off to visiting heads of state and other dignitaries. The city still enjoys a prominent status in modern Russia today and is a favourite spot for summits and other governmental meetings.


NEIGHBOURHOODS AT A GLANCE

1Historic Heart

Radiating out from the golden spire of the Admiralty towards the Fontanka River, the Historic Heart has plenty of obvious attractions, such as the Hermitage, Russian Museum and the Church on the Spilled Blood, not to mention the city's most famous avenue: Nevsky Prospekt. There are also quirky gems like the Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines and a quartet of lovely parks. This is where you will be spending most of your time in St Petersburg, especially as the area is also blessed with excellent hotels, dining and drinking options.
2Smolny & Vosstaniya

This agglomeration of four districts (Smolny, Liteyny, Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya) is also part of the city centre. The Smolny peninsula is a well-heeled residential district dominated by the Smolny Cathedral, while next-door Liteyny is centred on Liteyny pr, a commercial street between the Smolny and the Fontanka River. South of Nevsky pr are Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya. Vosstaniya is the focus of St Petersburg’s underground art and drinking scene, while Vladimirskaya, named after the stunning Vladimirsky Cathedral, is a mercantile district full of shopping, markets and a clutch of quirky museums.
3Sennaya & Kolomna

These two areas adjoin the Historic Heart and are almost as historic themselves. Sennaya is centred on Sennaya Pl (the Haymarket), a traditionally poor area that was immortalised in Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment and has somehow retained its seedy, down-at-heel air despite a big attempt to redevelop it. Kolomna is the largest of seven islands and a quiet, rather out-of-the-way place, although one steeped in history and great beauty. It contains the world-famous Mariinsky Theatre and more canals and rivers than any other part of the city.
4Vasilyevsky Island

The eastern edge of Vasilyevsky Island (or VO as it's usually shortened to) was originally designed to be the administrative heart of the city under Peter the Great. The plan was never carried out but there's still a concentration of historical sights there, including the Strelka and Kunstkamera. The western side of the island is more industrial, but is also home to the fantastic Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. Transport fans will be thrilled by the opportunity to tour a couple of submarines and an icebreaker, and by museums devoted to trams and the metro.
5Petrograd & Vyborg Sides

The Petrograd Side is a fascinating place that includes everything from the Peter and Paul Fortress to an impressive clutch of Style Moderne buildings lining its main drag. It also hosts a beautiful mosque, many interesting museums and huge swaths of parkland on the Kirov Islands, the city’s largest green lung. The Vyborg Side is famous for its role in Soviet history and can be a little bleak. That said, a walk around the fascinating postindustrial landscape here will appeal to travellers who have palace fatigue, and a few interesting sights make the trip worthwhile.



TOP SIGHT
THE HERMITAGE
The Hermitage fully lives up to its sterling reputation. You can be absorbed by its treasures for days and still come out wanting more. The enormous collection (over three million items, only a fraction of which are on display in 360 rooms) almost amounts to a comprehensive history of Western European art.

History
Catherine the Great, one of the greatest art collectors of all time, began the collection. Nicholas I also greatly enriched it and opened the galleries to the public for the first time in 1852.
It was the post-revolutionary period that saw the collection increase threefold, as many valuable private collections were seized by the state, including those of the Stroganovs, Sheremetyevs and Yusupovs. In 1948 it incorporated the renowned collections of post-Impressionist and Impressionist paintings of Moscow industrialists Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov.

Visiting the Hermitage
The State Hermitage consists of five linked buildings along riverside Dvortsovaya nab (rom west to east):
Winter Palace (Зимний дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Dvortsovaya pl 2; combined ticket R700; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mAdmiralteyskaya) This stunning mint-green, white and gold profusion of columns, windows and recesses, with its roof topped by rows of classical statues, was commissioned from Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1754 by Empress Elizabeth. Catherine the Great and her successors had most of the interior remodelled in a classical style by 1837. It remained an imperial home until 1917, though the last two tsars spent more time in other palaces.
Small Hermitage (Малый Эрмитаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Dvortsovaya pl 2; joint ticket R700; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mAdmiralteyskaya) Used by Catherine the Great as a retreat and to house the art collection started by Peter the Great, which she significantly expanded.
Great (Old) Hermitage (Большой (Старый) Эрмитаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Dvortsovaya pl 2; joint ticket R700; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mAdmiralteyskaya) This section of the museum (also known as the Large Hermitage) dates from the time of Catherine the Great. It mainly houses Italian Rennaissance art including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Giorgione, Titian, Botticelli, Caravaggio and Tiepolo.
New Hermitage (Новый Эрмитаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Dvortsovaya pl 2; joint ticket R700; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mAdmiralteyskaya) Built for Nicholas II in 1852, to hold the growing art collection and as a museum for the public. Designed by German neoclassicist architect and painter von Klenze, the historically preserved rooms house the museum's collections of ancient art, European paintings, sculptures and decorative art.
Hermitage Theatre ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-408 1084; https://hermitagetheater.com; Dvortsovaya nab 32; online tickets from R8300; mAdmiralteyskaya) Designed by Giacomo Quarenghi, this intimate neo-classical auditorium was once the private theatre of the imperial family, and stands on the site of the original Winter Palace of Peter I.
The main public entrance is via the courtyard of the Winter Palace off Palace Sq.
Quick Tour
It would take days to fully do justice to the Hermitage’s huge collection. If your time is limited, zone in on the following rooms:
Room 100 Ancient Egypt
Jordan Staircase Directly ahead when you pass through the main entrance inside the Winter Palace.
Rooms 175–98 Imperial state rooms and apartments, including the Malachite Hall, Nicholas Hall, Armorial Hall and Hall of St George.
Room 204 The Pavilion Hall.
Rooms 207–238 Italian art, 13th to 18th centuries.
Rooms 239–40 Spanish art, 16th to 18th centuries.
Rooms 245–47 Flemish art, 17th century.
Rooms 249–254 Dutch art, 17th century.
Room 271 Grand Church, the imperial family’s cathedral.
Room 298–301 English art.
The Hermitage is a dynamic institution. Displays change, renovations continue, specific pieces go on tour, and temporary exhibitions occupy particular rooms, displacing whatever normally resides there, so be prepared for slight changes.
TOP TIPS
AAvoid possibly long entrance queues by buying your ticket online. The printed-out voucher or PDF on a wi-fi–enabled device is valid for 180 days.
AAlternatively pay at the computerised ticket machines in the main entrance courtyard and be sure to wait for your tickets to be printed at the end of the transaction (they come after the payment receipt).
AIf you leave jackets and bags in the cloakroom, be aware that you can’t go back for anything without leaving the museum.
AHandbags, small shoulder bags and plastic bags are allowed in the Hermitage, but backpacks aren’t.
Organised Tours
Contact the excursions office to arrange a guided tour. These are one way to avoid queuing and, although they whiz round the main sections in about 1½ hours, at least they provide an introduction to the place in English, German or French. It’s easy to ‘lose’ the group and stay on until closing time.
Also contact the excursions office if you plan to visit the Hermitage's Treasure Gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-571 8446; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Winter Palace, Dvortsovaya pl; tour of Diamond or Golden Rooms R350; mAdmiralteyskaya). These two special collections, guarded behind vault doors, are open only by guided tour, for which you should either call ahead to reserve a place, or buy a ticket at the entrance. The Golden Rooms collection focuses on a hoard of fabulous Scythian and Greek gold and silver from the Caucasus, Crimea and Ukraine, dating from the 7th to 2nd centuries BC; the Diamond Rooms section has fabulous jewellery from Western Europe, and pieces from as far apart as China, India and Iran.
Other Branches
As much as you see in the museum, there’s about 20 times more in its vaults, part of which you can visit at the Hermitage Storage Facility. Other museum branches are the General Staff Building (home to the Hermitage's amazing collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist works), the Winter Palace of Peter I, the Menshikov Palace on Vasilyevsky Island, and the Imperial Porcelain factory.

PETER & PAUL FORTRESS
Housing a cathedral, a former prison and various exhibitions, this large defensive fortress on Zayachy Island is the kernel from which St Petersburg grew into the city it is today and a must-see for history buffs. There are also panoramic views from atop the fortress walls, at the foot of which lies a sandy riverside beach, a prime spot for sunbathing.

Entry & Tickets
The fortress was founded in 1703 and has never been utilised in the city’s defence – unless you count incarceration of political ‘criminals’ as national defence.
The main entrance is across the Ioannovsky Bridge at the island's northeast end; there's also access via the Kronwerk Bridge, which is within walking distance of Sportivnaya metro station.
Individual tickets are needed for each of the fortress’s attractions – though a combined entrance ticket gives access to Peter and Paul Cathedral, the Trubetskoy Bastion and three other sites.
Sights
All of Russia's prerevolutionary rulers from Peter the Great onwards (except Peter II and Ivan VI) are buried inside the SS Peter & Paul Cathedral ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R450/250; h10am-7pm Mon, Tue & Thu-Sat, 11am-7pm Sun; mGorkovskaya), which has a magnificent baroque interior. To ascend its 122.5m-high bell tower you'll have to join a guided tour (in Russian only), which happen several times a day.
Among the other sights don't miss the Commandant's House ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R200/120; h11am-6pm Mon & Thu-Sun, to 5pm Tue; mGorkovksaya), which charts the history of the St Petersburg region from medieval times to 1918; Trubetskoy Bastion ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R200/120; h10am-7pm Thu-Mon, to 6pm Tue; mGorkovskaya), where evocative use is made of the original cells for displays about the former political prisoners, who included the likes of Maxim Gorky, Leon Trotsky and Fyodor Dostoevsky.
A separate ticket gains you access to both the Postern, a 97.4m passage hidden in the fortress walls, and the Neva Panorama ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R300/270; h10am-8pm Thu-Tue; mGorkovskaya), a walkway atop the walls, which concludes at Naryshkin Bastion. Every day at noon a cannon is fired from here, a tradition dating back to Peter the Great's times.

RUSSIAN MUSEUM
Focusing solely on Russian art, from ancient church icons to 20th-century paintings, the Russian Museum's collection is magnificent and can easily be viewed in half a day or less. The collection is less overwhelming than that of the Hermitage, but the masterpieces nonetheless keep on coming as you tour the Mikhailovsky Palace and the attached Benois Wing.

Museum Tour
Enter the Mikhailovsky Palace's lower floor to the right of the main facade. Pick up a museum map before ascending the magnificent main staircase to the 1st floor, as this is where the chronological ordering of the exhibits from the 10th to the 20th century begins.
Galleries close for restoration and rehangings from time to time, and works are sometimes loaned out, so be prepared for slight changes to the following.
Mikhailovsky Palace, 2nd floor
Rooms 1–4 Russian icon painting, including work from the three major schools of Russian icon painting: Novgorod, Muscovy and Pskov.
Room 7 Houses a sculpture of Empress Anna with an Arab Boy.
Room 11 The White Hall, the most ornate in the palace, with period furniture by Rossi, is where Strauss and Berlioz performed concerts.
Room 14 Karl Bryullov’s massive Last Day of Pompeii (1827–33), which was, in its time, the most famous Russian painting ever; there were queues for months to see it. Ivan Aivazovsky’s seascapes also stand out, most frighteningly The Wave.
Room 15 Features a huge number of studies for Alexander Ivanov’s most famous work, The Appearance of Christ to the People, which hangs in Moscow’s Tretyakov Gallery.
Mikhailovsky Palace, 1st floor
Rooms 23–26 The Wanderers (Peredvizhniki) and associated artists, including KA Savitsky’s To War (Room 31); and Konstantin Makovsky (Room 25). Ghe’s masterpiece, Peter I Interrogating Tsarevich Alexey in Peterhof, is usually found in Room 26 along with other dark Ghe’s works such as The Last Supper.
Room 28 Pause to take in the talent of Ukrainian artist Marie Bashkirtseff, who died young, but not before painting striking portraits, such as Umbrella and the Three Smiles series.
Rooms 33–34 Works by Ilya Repin (1844–1930), probably Russia’s best-loved artist. His masterpiece, Barge Haulers on the Volga, an unrivalled portrait of human misery and enslavement in rural Russia, shows why the early Soviet authorities held him in high regard as a model for the Socialist Realist painters to come. Also check out his Zaporozhye Cossacks Writing a Mocking Letter to theTurkish Sultan.
Rooms 48 Mark Antokolsky’s statues Ivan the Terrible and Death of Socrates flank a souvenir stand. From here you enter the Benois Wing to your right or continue straight ahead for the lovely Russian folk art galleries featuring everything from kitchen equipment to giant carved house gables.
Room 54 Repin’s enormous rendition of the Ceremonial Sitting of the State Council on 7 May 1901, Marking the Centenary of Its Foundation. Around the walls are individual portraits of its members.
Benois Wing 2nd & 1st floors
Room 66 Works by the father of modern Russian art, Mikhail Vrubel including Epic Hero (Bogatyr) and Flying Demon.
Rooms 67–71 Works by an array of important early-20th-century painters including Nikolai Sapunin, Mikhail Nesterov and Boris Kustodiev, whose Merchant’s Wife at Tea is perhaps the most well-known picture here.
Room 72 Nathan Altman’s famous cubist Portrait of Anna Akhmatova.
Room 75–76 Works by suprematist Kasimir Malevich.
Rooms 77–78 Constructivist works by Alexander Lebedev and Alexander Rodchenko.
Rooms 79 Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin’s Portrait of Akhmatova and Mother of God.
Rooms 80–81 Most paintings from the Stalin era may have been censored beyond meaning, but there are some interesting portraits of daily life here, such as Alexander Samokhvalov’s Militarised Komsomol (1932–3)
Rooms 82–86 Late Soviet art is represented here. Look for Alexei Sundukov's Queue, which captures the failed economy of the times, and Dmitry Zhilinsky's The Artist's Family, showing several generations of a family.
Rooms 87–94 Works in these galleries range from a beautifully glazed ceramic fireplace by Mikhail Vrubel and other art nouveau–inspired pieces, to Soviet-era textiles, porcelain and textiles printed with ingenious patterns made out of tiny tractors or planes.
To reach the 1st floor of the Benois Wing (following your tour of the museum's main collection), use the stairs down off Rooms 91 and 92.
Branches of the Museum
Permanent and temporary exhibitions by the Russian Museum are also held at the Marble Palace, the Mikhailovsky Castle (also known as the Engineer's Castle) and the Stroganov Palace. Combined tickets, available at each palace, cover entrance either to your choice of two the same day (adult/student R600/270) or to all four within a three-day period (R850/400).
Mikhailovsky Palace was designed by Carlo Rossi and built between 1819 and 1825. It was a gift for Grand Duke Mikhail (brother of Tsars Alexander I and Nicholas I) as compensation for missing out on the throne. Nicholas II opened it as a public gallery on 7 March 1898.
The Benois Wing houses pieces from the 20th century as well as temporary exhibitions. It was constructed between 1914 and 1919. It is accessible through an entrance on nab kanala Griboyedova and connected to the original palace.

ST ISAAC'S CATHEDRAL
The golden dome of St Isaac’s Cathedral dominates the St Petersburg skyline. Its obscenely lavish interior is open as a museum, although services are held in the cathedral throughout the year. Most people bypass the museum to climb the 262 steps to the kolonnada (colonnade) around the drum of the dome, providing superb city views.

Montferrand's Design
Named after St Isaac of Dalmatia, on whose feast day Peter the Great was born, this is one of the largest domed buildings in the world.
French architect Auguste Montferrand began designing the cathedral in 1818. Due partly to technical issues, it took so long to build (until 1858) that Nicholas I was able to insist on an even more grandiose structure than Montferrand had originally planned. More than 100kg of gold leaf was used to cover the 21.8m-high dome alone, while the huge granite pillars on the building’s facade each weigh over 120 tonnes. There’s a statue of Montferrand holding a model of the cathedral on the west facade, although Nicholas I denied the architect his dying wish, to be buried here, considering it too high an honour for a mere artisan.
The cathedral’s interior is lavishly decorated with 600 sq metres of mosaics, 16,000kg of malachite, 14 types of marble and an 816-sq-metre ceiling painting by Karl Bryullov. Look out for some interesting photographs of the cathedral throughout its history, too.
Concerts & the Collonade
Check the website for details of choral concerts that are occasionally held here. From May to October both the cathedral and colonnade are open until 10.30pm, and from 1 June to 20 August the colonnade stays open until 4.30am.

Devote day two to the wondrous Hermitage and its extraordinary collection, including the stellar impressionist collection in the General Staff Building on the other side of Palace Sq. When you leave, relax by taking a sightseeing cruise around the canals, followed by dinner at Cococo, enjoying contemporary takes on traditional Russian cuisine.

Four Days
On day three start at the Peter & Paul Fortress to see where the city began, and wander past the Mosque and take in the Style Modern architecture of Kamennoostrovsky pr. Wander across the bridge to Vasilevsky Island and see the Strelka, the fascinating Kunstkamera and then either the Menshikov Palace, for history fans, or the Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art, for art lovers.
Start day four travelling out to Pushkin (Tsarskoe Selo) for a visit to the extraordinary Catherine Palace, and then continue to nearby Pavlovsk for a walk in the gorgeous gardens. If you have time on returning to the city, make a tour of the superb Russian Museum. Top off the night with cocktails at one of St Petersburg's cosy bars such as Apotheke Bar.


THE BRIDGES OF ST PETERSBURG

Some 342 bridges span St Petersburg’s network of canals and waterways. It's quite a sight to witness the raising of the bridges over the Neva river during the navigation period. 

!!!
Dvortsovy most (Palace Bridge; Дворцовый мост MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mAdmiralteyskaya), beside the Winter Palace, is one of the most popular spots to watch this event as there is classical music broadcasting and a carnival atmosphere with street vendors and plenty of sightseeing boats bobbing in the Neva.

Some of the most charming bridges, though, are the smaller structures that span the canals around the city. Here are a few of our favourites:
!!!
Anichkov most (Аничков мост MAP GOOGLE MAP ) Features rearing horses at all four corners, symbolising humanity’s struggle with, and taming of, nature.
!
Bankovsky most (Банковский мост MAP GOOGLE MAP ) Suspended by cables emerging from the mouths of golden-winged griffins. The name comes from the Assignment Bank (now a university), which stands on one side of the bridge.
!
Most Lomonosova (Мост Ломоносова MAP GOOGLE MAP ) Four Doric towers contain the mechanism that pulls up the moveable central section, allowing tall boats to pass along the Fontanka underneath.
!
Lviny most (Bridge of Four Lions; MAP GOOGLE MAP ) This suspension bridge is supported by two pairs of regal lions.
!
Panteleymonovsky most (Пантелеймоновский мост MAP GOOGLE MAP ) At the confluence of the Moyka and the Fontanka, this beauty features lamp posts bedecked with the double-headed eagle and railings adorned with the coat of arms.

MONASTERY
(Александро-Невская лавра MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.lavra.spb.ru; Nevsky pr 179/2; cemetery R400, pantheon R150; hgrounds 6am-11pm summer, 8am-9pm winter, churches 6am-9pm, cemeteries 9.30am-6pm summer, 11am-4pm winter, pantheon 11am-5pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun; mPloshchad Aleksandra Nevskogo)
The Alexander Nevsky Monastery – named for the patron saint of St Petersburg – is the city's most ancient and eminent monastery. Peter the Great made a mistake when he founded the monastery on this spot at the far end of Nevsky pr, thinking wrongly that it was the site where Alexander of Novgorod had beaten the Swedes in 1240. Nonetheless, in 1797 the monastery became a lavra, the most senior grade of Russian Orthodox monasteries.
Today it is a working monastery that attracts the most devout believers – a revered and holy place – as well as the gravesite of some of Russia's most famous artistic figures. You can wander freely around most of the grounds, but you must buy tickets from the kiosk on your right after entering the main gates to enter the most important two graveyards.

Museum of the Defence & Blockade of Leningrad
MUSEUM
(Музей обороны и блокады Ленинграда MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.blokadamus.ru; Solyarnoy per 9; R250, audio guide R300; h10am-6pm Thu-Mon, 12.30-8.30pm Wed; mChernyshevskaya)
The grim but engrossing displays here contain donations from survivors, propaganda posters from the blockade period and many photos depicting life and death during the siege. You'll see the meagre bread rations as they dwindled by the month, drawings made by children trying to cope with the loss of family members, and snapshots taken during Shostakovich's Symphony No.7 – composed and played during the siege (by famished musicians), to show the world that Leningrad was not down for the count.

Anna Akhmatova Museum at the Fountain House
MUSEUM
(Музей Анны Ахматовой в Фонтанном Доме MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.akhmatova.spb.ru; Liteyny pr 51; adult/child R120/free, audio guide R200; h10.30am-6.30pm Tue & Thu-Sun, noon-8pm Wed; mMayakovskaya)
Housed in the south wing of the Sheremetyev Palace, this touching and fascinating literary museum celebrates the life and work of Anna Akhmatova, St Petersburg’s most famous 20th-century poet. Akhmatova lived here from 1926 until 1952, invited by the art scholar Nikolai Punin, who lived in several rooms with his family. The two had a long-running affair, somewhat complicated by the tight living situation – Punin didn't want to separate from his wife.
Admission also includes the Josef Brodsky American Study. Brodsky did not live here, but his connection with Akhmatova was strong. For lack of a better location, his office has been re-created here, complete with furniture and other artifacts from his adopted home in Massachusetts. Funds are currently being collected to open a Josef Brodsky Museum at the poet's former home a few blocks away on Liteyny pr.
When coming to the museum, be sure to enter from Liteyny pr, rather than from the Fontanka River, where the main palace entrance is, as it's not possible to reach the museum from there.

Fyodor Dostoevsky lived in flats all over the city (mostly in Sennaya), but his final residence is this ‘memorial flat’ where he lived from 1878 until he died in 1881. The apartment remains as it was when the Dostoevsky family lived here, including the study where he wrote The Brothers Karamazov, and the office of Anna Grigorievna, his wife, who recopied, edited and sold all of his books.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-812-407 1731; www.lumierehall.ru/spb; nab Obvodny kanala 74; R500; h11am-11pm; mFruzenskaya)
In a once-industrial part of the city, Lumiere Hall hosts large-format multimedia exhibitions – basically massive 3D projections in a 360-degree space, with audio commentary on the works displayed and the artists behind the creations. Take a seat on beanbags and enjoy the show. Recent installations have included projections of paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky, Van Gogh and Gustav Klimt. It's a 1km walk from the metro station. Head up to the canal and turn right.

Tauride Palace & Gardens
PARK
(Таврический дворец и сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h8am-8pm Aug-Mar, to 10pm May-Jul, closed Apr; mChernyshevskaya)
Catherine the Great had this baroque palace built in 1783 for Grigory Potemkin, a famed general and her companion for many years. Today it is home to the Commonwealth of Independent States and is closed to the public. The gardens, on the other hand, are open to all; once the romping grounds of the tsarina, they became a park for the people under the Soviets, and their facilities include a lake, several cafes and an entertainment centre.

(Арт-Центр Пушкинская 10 MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.p-10.ru; Ligovsky pr 53; R500; h4-8pm Wed-Fri, noon-8pm Sat & Sun; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
This now legendary locale is a former apartment block – affectionately called by its street address despite the fact that the public entrance is actually on Ligovsky pr – that contains studio and gallery space, as well as music clubs Fish Fabrique and Fabrique Nouvelle ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.fishfabrique.spb.ru; Ligovsky pr 53; h3pm-late; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), plus an assortment of other shops and galleries. It offers a unique opportunity to hang out with local musicians and artists, who are always eager to talk about their work.
One ticket gives admission to all the galleries.

Vladimirsky Cathedral
CATHEDRAL
(Владимирский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Vladimirsky pr 20; h8am-6pm, services 6pm daily; mVladimirskaya)
This fantastic, five-domed cathedral, ascribed to Domenico Trezzini, is the namesake of this neighbourhood. Incorporating both baroque and neoclassical elements, the cathedral was built in the 1760s, with Giacomo Quarenghi’s neoclassical belltower added later in the century. One famous member of the congregation was Dostoevsky, who lived around the corner. The cathedral was closed in 1932 and the Soviets turned it into an underwear factory, but in 1990 it was reconsecrated and resumed its originally intended function.

Also known as the Stieglitz Museum, this fascinating establishment is as beautiful as you would expect a decorative arts museum to be. An array of gorgeous objects is on display, from medieval furniture to 18th-century Russian tiled stoves and contemporary works by the students of the Applied Arts School (also housed here). This museum is less visited than some of its counterparts in the city, but the quiet atmosphere only adds to its appeal.

Named after Sergey Kuryokhin (1954–96), a legend of the Russian contemporary arts and music scene, this is the temporary home of the arts centre until its new home on Vasilevsky Island is ready (late 2019). You can view some of the talented avant-garde artist's work and that of his contemporaries including the band Kino and performance artist Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe. You can also see exhibitions of new works that push the artistic boundaries.

If baroque is your thing, then look no further than the sky-blue Smolny Cathedral, an unrivalled masterpiece of the genre that ranks among Bartolomeo Rastrelli’s most amazing creations. The cathedral is the centrepiece of a convent mostly built to Rastrelli’s designs between 1748 and 1757. His inspiration was to combine baroque details with the forest of towers and onion domes typical of an old Russian monastery. You'll get a fascinating perspective over the church and city beyond from the 63m-high belltower.

This spectacular palace on the Moyka River has some of the best 19th-century interiors in the city, in addition to a fascinating and gruesome history. The palace’s last owner was the eccentric Prince Felix Yusupov, a high-society darling and at one time the richest man in Russia. Most notoriously, the palace is the place where Grigory Rasputin was murdered in 1916, and the basement where this now infamous plot unravelled can be visited as part of a guided tour.
oNew HollandISLAND
(Новая Голландия MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.newhollandsp.ru; nab Admiralteyskogo kanala; h9am-10pm Mon-Thu, to 11pm Fri-Sun; mSadovaya)
This triangular island was closed for the most part of the last three centuries, and has opened to the public in dazzling fashion. There's plenty going on here, with hundreds of events happening throughout the year. There are summertime concerts, art exhibitions, yoga classes and film screenings, plus restaurants, cafes and shops. You can also come to enjoy a bit of quiet on the grass – or on one of the pontoons floating in the pond.
Central Naval MuseumMUSEUM

Following a move to this beautifully repurposed building opposite the former shipyard of New Holland, the Central Naval Museum has moved into the 21st century and is now one of St Petersburg's best history museums. The superb, light-bathed building houses an enormous collection of models, paintings and other artefacts from three centuries of Russian naval history, including botik, the small boat known as the 'grandfather of the Russian navy' – stumbling across it in the late 17th century was Peter the Great's inspiration to create a Russian maritime force.

This fabulous and fully restored mansion on the Moyka River belonged to Grand Duke Alexey, the son of Alexander II. The wrought-iron-and-stone fence is one of its most stunning features, with the Grand Duke’s monogram adorning the gates. Tours of the house usually take place once or twice a week, but the dates vary and tickets often sell out in advance, so check the website. Another way to visit the interior is to attend a concert here.
Grand Choral SynagogueSYNAGOGUE

Designed by Vasily Stasov, the striking Grand Choral Synagogue opened in 1893 to provide a central place of worship for St Petersburg’s growing Jewish community. Its lavishness (particularly notable in the 47m-high cupola and the decorative wedding chapel) indicates the pivotal role that Jews played in imperial St Petersburg. The synagogue was fully revamped in 2003. Visitors are welcome except on the Sabbath and other holy days. Men and married women should cover their heads upon entering.

Nikolsky CathedralCATHEDRAL
(Никольский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nikolskaya pl 1/3; h9am-7pm; mSadovaya)
Surrounded on two sides by canals, this ice-blue cathedral is one of the most picture-perfect in the city, beloved by locals for its baroque spires and golden domes. It was one of the few churches that still operated during the Soviet era, when organised religion was effectively banned.
Rumyantsev MansionMUSEUM
(Особняк Румянцева MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Angliyskaya nab 44; adult/student R200/100; h11am-6pm Thu-Mon, to 5pm Tue; mAdmiralteyskaya)
History buffs should not miss this oft-overlooked but superb local museum. Part of the State Museum of the History of St Petersburg, the mansion contains an exhibition of 20th-century history, including displays devoted to the 1921 New Economic Policy (NEP), the industrialisation and development of the 1930s, and the Siege of Leningrad during WWII. Exhibitions are unusual in that they depict everyday life in the city during these historic periods. Each room has an explanatory panel in English.
Sennaya PloshchadSQUARE
(Сенная площадь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Immortalised by Dostoevsky, who lived all over the neighbourhood and set Crime and Punishment here, St Petersburg’s Haymarket was once the city’s filthy underbelly. Indeed, until a much-needed facelift just over a decade ago, the square was overloaded with makeshift kiosks and market stalls, which made it a magnet for the homeless, beggars, pickpockets and drunks. These days, you'll have to look hard to find vestiges of its once insalubrious days.
Nabokov MuseumMUSEUM
(Музей Набокова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.nabokov.museums.spbu.ru/En; Bolshaya Morskaya ul 47; h11am-6pm Tue-Fri, to 5pm Sat; mAdmiralteyskaya)F
This 19th-century townhouse was the suitably grand childhood home of Vladimir Nabokov, infamous author of Lolita and arguably the most versatile of 20th century Russian writers. Here Nabokov lived with his wealthy family from his birth in 1899 until the revolution in 1917, when they left the country. Nabokov artefacts on display include family photographs, first editions of his books and parts of his extensive butterfly collection.
Railway MuseumMUSEUM

This museum near Sennaya pl is a must for train-set fans and modellers. It houses a collection of scale locomotives and model railway bridges, often made by the engineers who built the real ones. The oldest such collection in the world, the museum dates to 1809, 28 years before Russia had its first working train!
WORTH A TRIP
SOVIET SOUTH

Sprawling southern St Petersburg was once planned to be the centre of Stalin’s Leningrad, and it contains grand buildings, over-the-top monuments and sculpture-lined green spaces that celebrate now mostly forgotten figures of the past. You’ll also see largely middle-class Russians and families, who’ve given new life to these marble-lined boulevards.
Moscow Triumphal Arch
Bristling with spears, shields and banners, this imposing 12-columned gate was built to celebrate victory in the 1828 Russo-Turkish War and once marked the southern entrance to the imperial capital. In 1936 the gates were dismantled under Stalin’s order and were later used as anti-tank defences in WWII. They were restored in 1960.
Grand Market Rossiya
Russia in all its grit and glory – from the industrial sprawl of Magnitogorsk to the glittering domes of Moscow – is on full display at this vast re-creation ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-495 5465; www.grandmaket.ru; Tsvetochnaya ul 16; adult/child R480/280, audio guide or binoculars R250; h10am-8pm; mMoskovskoe Vorota) of the motherland in miniature. One huge room contains mountains, cities, rivers and lakes, with lots of mechanised action that you can observe while strolling around.

Park Pobedy
This large green space gathers a cross-section of Petersburgers, including young families, teens and canoodling couples who stroll the leafy paths and enjoy the views over the ponds and flower gardens. Built to celebrate Russia’s victory in WWII, the park ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Moskovsky pr; h6am-midnight; mPark Pobedy) is full of statues of Soviet war heroes, and has a beneficent depiction of Lenin interacting with small children.
Chesme Church
This striking red-and-white 18th-century Gothic church (Чесменская церковь GOOGLE MAP ; https://chesma.spb.ru; ul Lensoveta 12; h10am-7pm; mMoskovskaya) commemorates the 1770 Battle of Chesme. This is where Catherine the Great was standing when news arrived of the victory over the Turks. The capricious monarch ordered a shrine be built to preserve this historic moment. It now seems particularly incongruous with its Stalinist surroundings.
House of the Soviets
Begun by Noi Trotsky in 1936, the bombastic House of Soviets (Дом советов GOOGLE MAP ; Moskovsky pr 212; mMoskovskaya) was only finished after the war, by which time the architect had been purged. Nonetheless, this magnificently sinister building is a great example of Stalinist design, with its columns and bas-reliefs and an enormous frieze across the top.
Monument to the Heroic Defenders of Leningrad
Centred around a 48m-high obelisk, the monument (Монумент героическим защитникам Ленинграда GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; pl Pobedy; R200; h10am-6pm Thu-Mon, until 5pm Tue; mMoskovskaya), unveiled in 1975, symbolises the city’s encirclement and eventual victory in WWII. On a lower level, flickering torches ring a very moving sculpture depicting the city’s suffering. From there, you can enter an underground exhibition, which delves into the war and siege.
Vasilyevsky Island
oKunstkameraMUSEUM

Also known as the Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology, this is the city’s first museum, founded in 1714 by Peter himself. It is famous largely for its ghoulish collection of monstrosities, preserved ‘freaks’, two-headed mutant foetuses, deformed animals and odd body parts, all collected by Peter. While most rush to see these sad specimens, there are also interesting exhibitions on native peoples from around the world.
oErarta Museum of Contemporary ArtMUSEUM
(Музей современного искусства Эрарта MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-324 0809; www.erarta.com; 29-ya Liniya 2; adult/under 21yr R500/350; h10am-10pm Wed-Mon; mVasileostrovskaya)
Erarta's superb hoard of 2300 pieces of Russian contemporary art trumps its somewhat far-flung location. Housed in an ingeniously converted neoclassical Stalinist building, the museum is spread over five floors, with the main galleries focused on the permanent collection. There are also installation spaces, plenty of temporary exhibitions, occasional shows, plus a good restaurant and gift shop.
StrelkaLANDMARK
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Birzhevaya pl; mVasileostrovskaya)
This eastern tip of Vasilyevsky Island is where Peter the Great wanted his new city’s administrative and intellectual centre to be. In fact, it became the focus of the city's maritime trade, symbolised by the colonnaded Customs House (now the Institute of Russian Literature) and the Old Stock Exchange. The Strelka is flanked by the pair of Rostral Columns (Ростральная колонна MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Birzhevaya pl; mVasileostrovskaya), archetypal St Petersburg landmarks.
Museum of ZoologyMUSEUM
(Зоологический музей MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-328 0112; www.zin.ru; Universitetskaya nab 1; adult/student R250/150; h11am-6pm Wed-Mon; mAdmiralteyskaya)
One of the biggest and best of its kind in the world, the Museum of Zoology was founded in 1832 and has some amazing exhibits, including a vast blue whale skeleton that greets you in the first hall. The highlight is unquestionably the stuffed skin of a 44,000-year-old woolly mammoth thawed out of the Siberian ice in 1902. There are also skeletons of a further three mammoths, including two baby ones – all incredible finds.

Menshikov PalaceMUSEUM
(Государственный Эрмитаж-Дворец Меншикова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-323 1112; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Universitetskaya nab 15; admission R300; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mVasileostrovskaya)
The first stone building in the city, the Menshikov Palace was built to the grandiose tastes of Prince Alexander Menshikov, Peter the Great’s closest friend and the first governor of St Petersburg. It is now a branch of the Hermitage, and while only a relatively small part of the palace is open to visitors, its interiors are some of the oldest and best preserved in the city.
Twelve CollegesUNIVERSITY
(Двенадцать коллегий MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Mendeleevskaya liniya; mVasileostrovskaya)
Completed in 1744 and marked by a statue of scientist-poet Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–65), the 400m-long Twelve Colleges is one of St Petersburg’s oldest buildings. It was originally meant for Peter’s government ministries, but is now part of the university, which stretches out behind it. Within these walls populist philosopher Nikolai Chernyshevsky studied, Alexander Popov created some of the world’s first radio waves and a young Vladimir Putin earned a degree in law.
This is also where Dmitry Mendeleev invented the periodic table of elements, and the building now contains the small Mendeleev Museum (Музей-Архив Санкт-Петербургского Университета Д.И.Менделеева MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-328 9744; Universitetskaya nab 7-9; h11am-4pm Mon-Fri; mVasileostrovskaya). Also of interest here is the University Sculpture Garden ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Universitetskaya nab 11; h8am-5pm; mAdmiralteyskaya), which can be accessed from the main entrance.

This stunning 1895 neo-Byzantine church was built by architect Vasily Kosyakov on the site of a former monastery. It was closed during the Soviet period, and in 1957 the building became the city’s first – and very popular – year-round skating rink. The 7.7m, 861kg metal cross on the roof was only replaced in 1998. Following a wonderful renovation, the church is looking superb again; do go inside to see the murals and icons covering the interior.

Art lovers should not bypass the museum of this time-tested institution, which contains work by academy students and faculty dating back to its foundation in 1857. Two 3500-year-old sphinxes guard the entrance of this original location of the academy, where boys would live from the age of five until they graduated at age 15. It was an experiment to create a new species of human: the artist.
CREATIVE CLUSTERS

Occupying either old buildings or former industrial complexes across the city are a series of 'creative clusters' that are home to a vibrant mix of artists, creative businesses, boutiques, bars and restaurants. The following are the best ones:
Loft Project ETAGI (Лофт проект ЭТАЖИ MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-458 5005; www.loftprojectetagi.ru; Ligovsky pr 74; rooftop R100; h9am-11pm; mLigovsky Prospekt) This five-floor former bakery, which includes exhibition spaces, eye-catching shops, a hostel, a bar and a cafe, kicked off the creative cluster trend in 2007. In the yard, converted shipping containers house yet more pop-up clothing shops, record sellers, cafes and eateries whipping up affordable street food.
Taiga The warren of rooms in the ancient building near the Hermitage are worth exploring to find cool businesses ranging from a barber to fashion and books. 8 Store ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-981-741 1880; http://8-store.ru; Dvortsovaya nab 20; h1-9pm; mAdmiralteyskaya), a stylish boutique stacked with clothes and accessories by local designers, is one of the best. Also great for original design gifts and souvenirs is Imenno Lavka (Именно-лавка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-921-581 0466; www.imenno-lavka.ru; TAIGA, Dvortsovaya nab 20; h11am-7pm; mAdmiralteyskaya).
Golitsyn Loft ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reky Fontanki 20; mGostiny Dvor) This new epicentre of creativity on the Fontanka River offers the usual mix of businesses as well as a hostel with capsule-style bunks. Enter via the archway into a large courtyard, which is spread with outdoor eating and drinking spots in the summer, then head up any of the stairwells into the five buildings for a bit of urban exploration. On weekends the centre stages events, such as craft markets, concerts and film screenings.
Berthold Center (Бертгольд Центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.vk.com/bertholdcentre; Grazhdanskaya ul 13; mSadovaya) A handful of shops, cafes and galleries spread around a former foundry. There's a courtyard in the centre of the complex that gathers a young, bohemian crowd – especially during special events and concerts (bands sometimes play on a rooftop just overlooking the courtyard).
Artmuza (Артмуза MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-313 4703; http://artmuza.spb.ru; 13-ya liniya 70-72; h11am-10pm; mSportivnaya) With around 13,000 sq metres of space over several floors, this is one of St Petersburg's largest creative clusters. On the ground floor look out for the joint atelier of Snega Gallery and Slavutnitsa where designers specialise in making clothes and accessories based on traditional Russian costumes and patterns. Also come here to see exhibitions and theatre, and to the enjoy the view from its large rooftop terrace (where there's also a cafe).
Tkachi (Ткачи MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tkachi.com; nab Obvodnogo kanala 60; h10am-10pm; mObvodny Kanal) In an otherwise derelict part of town, 'Weavers' is an impressive conversion of a warehouse into a 'creative space'. On the ground floor you'll find gifts, clothes, bikes and electronics, while the 5th floor is a huge exhibition space and restaurant.

Guided tours of the Hermitage’s state-of-the-art restoration and storage facility are highly recommended. This is not a formal exhibition as such, but the guides are knowledgeable and the examples chosen for display (paintings, furniture and carriages) are wonderful.
The storage facility is directly behind the big shopping centre opposite the metro station – look for the enormous golden-yellow glass facility decorated with shapes inspired by petroglyphs.
Museum of Political HistoryMUSEUM
(Музей политической истории России MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-313 6163; www.polithistory.ru; ul Kuybysheva 4; adult/child R200/free, audio guide R200; h10am-6pm Sat-Tue, 10am-8pm Wed & Fri, closed Thu; mGorkovskaya)
The elegant Style Moderne Kshesinskaya Palace (1904) is a highly appropriate location for this excellent museum – one of the city's best – covering Russian politics in scrupulous detail up to contemporary times.
The palace, previously the home of Mathilda Kshesinskaya, famous ballet dancer and one-time lover of Nicholas II in his pre-tsar days, was briefly the headquarters of the Bolsheviks, and Lenin often gave speeches from the balcony.

Kirov MuseumMUSEUM
(Музей Кирова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kirovmuseum.ru; Kamennoostrovsky pr 26/28; adult/child R150/100; h11am-6pm Thu-Tue; mPetrogradskaya)
Leningrad party boss Sergei Kirov was one of the most powerful men in Russia in the early 1930s. His decidedly un-proletarian apartment is now a fascinating museum showing how the Bolshevik elite really lived: take a quick journey back to the days of Soviet glory, including choice examples of 1920s technology, such as the first-ever Soviet-produced typewriter and a conspicuously noncommunist GE fridge, complete with plastic food inside.
Botanical GardensGARDENS

On eastern Aptekarsky (Apothecary) Island, this was once a garden of medicinal plants – founded by Peter the Great himself in 1714 – that gave the island its name. Today the botanical gardens contain 26 greenhouses on a 22-hectare site. It is a lovely place to stroll around, and a fascinating place to visit – and not just for botanists.
Buddhist TempleTEMPLE
(Буддистский Храм MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %981-755 9605; www.dazan.spb.ru; Primorsky pr 91; h10am-6pm Mon-Fri, to 7pm Sat & Sun; mStaraya Derevnya)
Another in the city's collection of grand religious buildings is this beautiful functioning datsan (temple) where respectful visitors are welcome. The main prayer hall has lovely mosaic decoration and there's a cheap and cheerful cafe in the basement. The temple was built between 1909 and 1915 at the instigation of Pyotr Badmaev, a Buddhist physician to Tsar Nicholas II.

Cruiser AuroraMUSEUM
(Крейсер Аврора MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-230 8440; www.aurora.org.ru; Petrovskaya nab; adult/child R600/400; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun; c; mGorkovskaya)
Moored on the Bolshaya Nevka, the Aurora had a walk-on part in the communist revolution. On the night of 25 October 1917, its crew fired a blank round from the forward gun as a signal for the start of the assault on the Winter Palace. Restored and painted in pretty colours, it’s a living museum that swarms with kids on weekends.
Artillery MuseumMUSEUM

Housed in the fort’s original arsenal, across the moat from the Peter & Paul Fortress, this fire-powered museum chronicles Russia’s military history, with examples of weapons dating all the way back to the Stone Age. The centrepiece is Lenin’s armoured car, which he rode in triumph from the Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal).
MosqueMOSQUE
(Соборная мечеть MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %821-233 9819; http://dum-spb.ru/kontakty; Kronverksky pr 7; h7am-9pm; mGorkovskaya)
This beautiful working mosque (built 1910–14) was modelled on Samarkand’s Gur-e Amir Mausoleum. Its fluted azure dome and minarets are stunning and surprisingly prominent in the city’s skyline. Outside of prayer times, if you are respectfully dressed (women should wear a head covering, men long trousers), you can walk through the gate at the northeast side and ask the guard for entry – the interior is equally lovely.
If you are allowed in, remove your shoes, do not talk and do not take photos.

WORTH A TRIP
STREET ART MUSEUM

You won't regret making the effort to see the magnificent Street Art Museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-448 1593; http://streetartmuseum.ru; shosse Revolutsii 84, Okhta, entrance on Umansky per; adult/student R350/250; hnoon-10pm Tue-Sun May-Sep; mPloshchad Lenina, then bus 28, 37, 137 or 530) set inside a former 11-hectare industrial site. You'll find a wide variety of formats, from huge murals covering walls to mixed-media installations set inside a former boilerhouse. Every year, the exhibition changes, with top artists from around the globe invited to contribute on themes like Revolution (featured in 2017 on the 100-year anniversary of Russia's October Revolution), Migrants and Peace.
Intriguingly, parts of this industrial complex are still active, with workers at the laminated plastics factory SLOPAST surrounded by the encroaching artwork. Some of the workshops are decorated with epic works by the likes of top Russian streets artists Timothy Radya, Kirill Kto and Nikita Nomerz as well as the Spanish artist Escif. Before he died in 2013, Pasha 183 – frequently referred to as Russia's Banksy because of his anonymity – also contributed 'Walls Don't Sleep' a beautiful monochrome mural based on an image of Soviet factory workers.
Guided tours happen on weekends (at 1pm and 2pm); call ahead to ensure an English-speaking guide is on hand. The museum also hosts outdoor concerts and other big events. Check the website for the latest.
It's located in the industrial zone of Okhta, a 20-minute bus ride east of Ploshchad Lenina. Buses 28, 37 and 137 all go there.

WORTH A TRIP
KIROVSKY ISLANDS

If you need a quick break from the city, these three outer delta islands on the Petrograd Side and an ideal place to head. Once marshy forests, the islands were granted to 18th- and 19th-century court favourites and developed into elegant playgrounds. Still mostly parkland, they are leafy venues for picnics, river sports and White Nights’ cavorting, as well as home to St Petersburg’s super rich.
Krestovsky Island (Крестовский остров MAP GOOGLE MAP ; c; mKrestovsky Ostrov) The biggest of the three, Krestovsky consists mostly of the vast Maritime Victory Park (Приморский парк Победы MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.primparkpobedy.ru; Krestovsky pr; mKrestovsky Ostrov), dotted with sports fields; at the far western end is the massive, 68,000-seat Krestovsky Stadium ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mKrestovsky Ostrov), which will play a pivotal role in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. At the park's main entrance opposite the metro station you can rent bikes and in-line skates. Also here is Divo Ostrov ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.divo-ostrov.ru; rides R100-500; hnoon-7pm; c; mKrestovsky Ostrov) is a Disney-style amusement park with exciting fairground rides that kids will adore.
Kamenny Island (Каменный остров MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mChyornaya Rechka) Century-old dacha (country cottages) and mansions, inhabited by very wealthy locals, line the wooded lanes that twist their way around Kamenny (Stone) Island. Punctuated by a series of canals, lakes and ponds, Kameny is pleasant for strolling at any time of year. At its east end, the Church of St John the Baptist ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Kamennoostrovsky pr; h9am-6pm), built in 1776–81, has been charmingly restored.
Car-free Yelagin Island (Елагин остров MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.elaginpark.org; ice skating per hr R200-300; hice skating 11am-9pm; mKrestovsky Ostrov) becomes a winter wonderland in colder temperatures, with sledding, cross-country skiing and ice skating. Skis and skates are available for hire. In summer months, it’s a great place to rent in-line skates.

Attached to the Sokos Hotel Palace Bridge, there's a good gym and a variety of spa treatments here, but the highlights are the giant swimming pool (with jet fountains to massage tired backs) and the many styles of sauna (including Finnish and Russian) in which to steam away all your stresses.
Degtyarniye BathsBATHHOUSE
(Дегтярные Бани MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-985 1983; www.d1a.ru; Degtyarnaya ul 1a; per hr R400-750, private banya R4500-17,500; h8.30am-10pm; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
These modern baths are divided up into men’s and women’s sections, or you can book private unisex bani (hot baths) of varying degrees of luxury (these accommodate up to 14 people). Prices are cheaper before 1pm on weekdays. Minimum charge of two hours.
Mytninskiye BaniBATHHOUSE
(Мытнинские бани MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mybanya.spb.ru; ul Mytninskaya 17-19; per hr R200-350; h8am-10pm Fri-Tue; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
Unique in the city, Mytninskiye Bani is heated by a wood furnace, just like the log-cabin bathhouses that are still found in the Russian countryside. It's actually the oldest communal banya (hot bath) in the city, and in addition to a parilka (steam room) and plunge pool, the private ‘lux’ banya (R1000 to R2000 per hour) includes a swanky lounge area with leather furniture and a pool table.
Kazachiye BaniBATHHOUSE
(Казачьи бани MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kazbani.ru; Bolshoy Kazachy per 11; per 2hr R100-300, private banya per hr R850-1700; h8am-10pm Tue-Sun; mPushkinskaya)
Following a trend that is occurring throughout the city, the communal banya is something of an afterthought here. The majority of the venue is given over to very swanky, private bani, which are an excellent option for groups of up to 10 people. The cheaper communal banya is good value though.
Kayaking & Yachting
oPiter KayakKAYAKING
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-921-435 9457; http://piterkayak.com; nab Kryukova kanala 26; tours R1700-2500; htours 7am Tue-Sun Apr-Sep)
Experienced kayaker Denis and his friendly young team lead these excellent early morning tours which last around four hours and cover 11km. The canals and rivers are at their quietest at this time and, unlike on regular boat tours, the slower pace allows you to admire the wonderful surroundings at your leisure.
Wild RussiaADVENTURE SPORTS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-313 8030; www.wildrussia.spb.ru; office 224, nab reki Fontanki 59; mGostiny Dvor)
Yachting and kayaking on Lake Ladoga can be arranged through the friendly and capable guys at Wild Russia. They can also arrange many other outdoor activities including off-road biking, parachuting, quad biking and rock climbing outside the city.
TTours
In a city as large as St Petersburg, a lot of travellers prefer to be shown around on a walking tour to kick things off. There are several excellent ones on offer, as well as bike tours and a hop-on, hop-off bus that can take you around the main sights of the centre. Viewing St Petersburg from a boat is an idyllic way to tour the city, and during the main tourist season (May to October) there are plenty of boats offering to help you do this. They are typically found at the Anichkov most landing on the Fontanka River, just off Nevsky pr; on the Neva outside the Hermitage and the Admiralty; beside the Kazansky most over the Griboyedova Canal; and along the Moyka River at Nevsky pr.
oPeterswalk Walking ToursWALKING
(%812-943 1229; http://peterswalk.com; from R1320)
Going for over 20 years, Peter Kozyrev’s innovative and passionately led tours are highly recommended as a way to see the city with knowledgeable locals. The daily Original Peterswalk (R1320) is one of the favourites and leaves daily from the Julia Child Bistro at 10.30am from April to end of September. Other tours from around R2000.
oSputnik ToursWALKING
(%499-110 5266; www.sputnik8.com; price varies)
This online tour agency is one with a difference: it acts as a marketplace for locals wanting to give their own unique tours of their own city. Browse, select a tour, register and pay a deposit and then you are given the contact number of the guide. A superb way to meet locals you'd never meet otherwise.

There’s a huge number of companies offering cruises all over the Historic Heart, all with similar prices and itineraries. Anglo Tourismo, however, is the only operator to run tours with commentary in English. Between May and September the schedule runs every 1½ hours between 11am and 6.30pm. From 1 June to 31 August there are also additional night cruises.
City TourBUS
(%812-648 1228; https://citytourspb.ru; day pass adult/child R700/300)
The familiar red ‘hop on, hop off’ double-decker buses you’ll see in most big cities in Europe (and beyond) are now well-established in St Petersburg. They offer a useful service for anyone unable to walk easily; buses run along Nevsky pr, passing the Hermitage, going over the Strelka, the Petrograd Side and then back to the historic centre.
Tickets are valid for as many trips in the time period as you like, and you can buy tickets when you board the bus. In summer months they also run a 'hop on, hop off' boat tour (one day bus and boat pass adult/child R1400/700) around the main rivers and canals.

In the middle of the complex you can visit the 7Church of the Saviour Not Made by Human Hand where Pushkin's funeral service was held.
Rest for a while in either the 8Mars Field, the former imperial guard parade grounds back over the Moyka River, or in the shady canal-side 9Mikhailovsky Gardens. Revived, you'll now be ready for the spectacular aChurch on the Spilled Blood. There's a spetacular view of the church from bTeatralny most near the intersection of the Moyka and Griboyedov Canal.

Head up Dumskaya ul to return to Nevsky pr and navigate your way along the exterior vaulted gallery surrounding the iBolshoy Gostiny Dvor, the 18th-century trading arcade still serving shoppers. A short walk east along Nevsky pr is Ploshchad Ostrovskogo, a small park with an impressive jstatue of Catherine the Great and a view the impressive facade of the kAlexandrinsky Theatre. Opposite, you can finish up at one of the cafes at the grand food hall lKupetz Eliseevs.

ST PETERSBURG FOR CHILDREN

There are plenty of activities that children will love in St Petersburg, especially during the summer months when the whole city is something of an outdoor playground.
Top museums for children include the Museum of Zoology, with thousands of stuffed animals (including several mammoths) on display; the Railway Museum, where you can see a range of scale locomotives and model railway bridges; and the Central Naval Museum with its superb collection of model boats. Also sure to entrance kids and adults alike are the incredibly detailed scale models of early 18th century St Petersburg at Petrovskaya Akvatoria (Петровская Акватория MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-933 4152; www.peteraqua.ru; Malaya Morskaya ul 4/1; adult/child R400/200; h10am-10pm; mAdmiralteyskaya) and the even more epic model village of Russia's greatest sights at Grand Maket.
One of the best parks to take kids in the city is on New Holland where there's a great kid's playground, a wooden model of a frigate to climb around, a giant chess set and free pétanque (a form of boules). Amusement parks, boats and bikes for hire, and lots of open space make the Kirovsky Islands another great outdoors option.
Wonderful puppet shows can be seen at both the Bolshoy Puppet Theatre (Большой театр кукол MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.puppets.ru; ul Nekrasova 10; tickets R350-600; mChernyshevskaya) and Demmeni Marionette Theatre ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-310 5879; www.demmeni.ru; Nevsky pr 52; htickets from R500; mGostiny Dvor).

4Sleeping
Hotels in St Petersburg are fairly expensive, with a lack of good midrange places in the city centre. Though they do exist, they tend to get booked up well in advance (particularly during the summer months), so plan ahead if you want to stay in the historic heart.
It is essential to reserve at least a month in advance for accommodation during the White Nights (late May to early July).
The following price ranges refer to the cheapest room available during the high season (May to July).
€ less than R3000
€€ R3000–15,000
€€€ more than R15,000

The owner of Baby Lemonade is crazy about the 1960s and it shows in the pop-art, psychedelic design of this friendly, fun hostel with two pleasant, large dorms and a great kitchen and living room. However, it's worth splashing out for the boutique-hotel-worthy private rooms that are in a separate flat with great rooftop views.

Sharing the top floor of a renovated historic building with a budget hotel, this is one of the best branches of the Friends chain.

The long-established Rachmaninov still feels like a secret place for those in the know. Perfectly located and run by friendly staff, it's pleasantly old world, with hardwood floors and attractive Russian furnishings, particularly in the breakfast salon, which has a grand piano.

There are just six rooms here and three of them share bathrooms and toilets, but it is much more like staying in a large apartment than a hostel. The communal areas are very pleasant and the rooms are comfortable and clean. Even better is the friendly service, central location and big windows overlooking the canal.

Near three bridges over the Moyka River, this 26-room property is surprisingly uncramped given its wonderful location.

On the 3rd floor of a handsome apartment building with an antique lift, this six-room pension takes its name from the nearby bridge.

Since 1830, when Carlo Rossi united three adjacent buildings with the grandiose facade we see today, little has been allowed to change in this heritage building. No two rooms are the same at this iconic hotel, but most are spacious and elegant. It's worth paying extra for the terrace rooms, which afford spectacular views across the city's rooftops.

Occupying a beautifully restored building on one of St Petersburg’s prettiest squares, the Rossi's 65 rooms are all designed differently, but their brightness and moulded ceilings are uniform. Antique beds, super-sleek bathrooms, exposed brick walls and lots of cool designer touches create a great blend of old and new.

What the Hotel Astoria has lost of its original Style Moderne decor, it more than compensates for in contemporary style and top-notch service. Little wonder it’s beloved of visiting VIPs, from kings to rock stars. Rooms marry the hotel’s heritage character with a more modern design, while the best suites are sprinkled with antiques and have spectacular views onto St Isaac’s Cathedral.

Following the formula of other creative clusters around town, this one, behind the post office on ul Vosstaniya, is also home to a hostel.

The location is cool, with boutiques, cafes and a bar on hand.

A total overhaul of the original building – a pre-revolutionary hotel in its day – paved the way for the sleek and stylish Hotel Indigo, a big step up from many St Petersburg offerings with its excellent service and handsomely designed guest rooms. The incredible atrium makes even the interior-facing rooms light filled, and touches such as rain showers and free minibars in rooms are also very welcome.

Ognivo earns high marks for its attractive, well-maintained rooms and quiet location. There's a bit of whimsy to the design in some of the 15 rooms, with inner wooden shutters over the windows, bold wallpaper and wildly patterned tilework in the bathrooms – others have cast-iron chandeliers and wood-beamed ceilings for a more medieval look.

In a grand art nouveau building dating from 1913, the Demetra Art Hotel has plush rooms with oak flooring, richly patterned drapes and duvets, and touches of artwork throughout (reproductions of works from the celebrated Erata Museum).

Tucked into a quiet courtyard in the narrow streets north of Sennaya pl, this friendly little hotel is a great bargain.

5Eating
There has never been a better time to eat out in St Petersburg. The range and quality of food available seem to increase year on year, making stereotypes about Russian food now seem like bizarre anachronisms. Petersburgers have well and truly caught the foodie bug, and while little of good quality is cheap in this town, the choice is now bigger than ever.
The following price ranges refer to the average cost of a main course.
€ less than R500
€€ R500–1000
€€€ more than R1000
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
LOCAL CHAINS

St Petersburg has a number of home-grown restaurant and cafe chains that are well worth knowing about as they provide cheap and reliable eating options all over town. Chief among these is the now international pie chain Stolle (Штолле; www.stolle.ru), a near-ubiquitous cafe where delicious, moist savoury and sweet pies are available to eat in and take away. Similar and equally numerous is the chain of bakery cafes Bulochnye F. Volcheka (Булочные Ф. Вольчека; www.fvolchek.ru). A couple of other chains to look out for are coffee-and-cake specialists Bushe (Буше; www.bushe.ru) and Baltic Bread (Балтийский Хлеб; www.baltic-bread.ru), which does good sandwiches and pastries.

A perennially popular cafe (expect to wait for a table at peak times) with a cosy feel and an interesting menu, ranging from Japanese-style chicken in teriyaki sauce to potato pancakes with salmon and cream cheese. Well-stocked bookshelves, a range of board games and adorable cuddly toys (each with its own name) encourage lingering.

The restaurant name, a punning reference to Jackie Chan in Russian, neatly sums up the burger-meets-Asian menu at this fine and stylish casual diner. Try the sweet-and-sour fish and the prawn-and-avocado salad with glass noodles.
MarketplaceRUSSIAN, INTERNATIONAL$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://market-place.me; Nevsky pr 24; mains R200-300; h8am-5.30am; Wv; mNevsky Prospekt)
The most central branch of this minichain that brings a high-class polish to the self-serve canteen concept, with many dishes cooked freshly on the spot to order. The hip design of the multilevel space is very appealing, making this a great spot to linger, especially if you indulge in one of the desserts or cocktails served on the 1st floor.
UkropVEGAN$

Proving veggie, vegan and raw food can be inventive and tasty as well as wholesome, Ukrop (meaning dill) also makes an effort with its bright and whimsical craft design, which includes swing seats and lots of natural materials.
There are other branches on Vasilyevsky Island and ul Vosstaniya.

When the east wing of the General Staff Building was turned into a new branch of the Hermitage, they at least made sure it had a decent place to eat (unlike in the Winter Palace). It's a self-serve cafe for drinks, appealing sandwiches and hot dishes and can be visited whether or not you go into the museum itself.

You could spend the better part of a day here. Ground floor is a waiter-service cafe where it's difficult to avoid being tempted by the cake and dessert display by the door; next up is a more formal restaurant; and on the top floor there's a multiroom lounge bar (closed Monday and Tuesday) with live music and DJs until 1am on Friday and Saturday.

Anton Abrezov is the talented exec chef behind this Scandi-cool meets Russian locavore restaurant where you can sample dishes such as a delicious corned beef salad with black garlic and pickled vegetables or an upmarket twist on ramen noodles with succulent roast pork.
The connected cocktail bar Madbaren is equally inventive, offering libations such as Siberian Penicillin (horseradish vodka, pollen syrup and rhubarb).

Like its sibling restaurant Chekov, Gogol whisks diners back to the genteel days of pre-revolutionary Russian home dining. The menu comes in a novel, with chapters for each of the traditional courses. Salads, soups, dumplings and classics such as chicken Kiev are all very well done and served in charming, small dining rooms.

Cococo has charmed locals with its inventive approach to contemporary Russian cuisine. Your food is likely to arrive disguised as, say, a small bird's egg, a can of peas or a broken flowerpot – all rather gimmicky, theatrical and fun. The best way to sample what it does is with its tasting menu (R2900). Bookings are advised.

This welcoming, warmly lit space serves outstanding Georgian fare. The recipes aren't overly complicated and the fine ingredients speak for themselves in flavour-rich dishes like aubergine baked with suluguni (a type of cheese), pork dumplings, and tender lamb stew with coriander.

(Чехов MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-234 4511; http://restaurant-chekhov.ru; Petropavlovskaya ul 4; mains R550-890; hnoon-11pm; mPetrogradskaya)
Despite a totally nondescript appearance from the street, this restaurant’s charming interior perfectly recalls that of a 19th-century dacha and makes for a wonderful setting for a meal. The menu, hidden inside classic novels, features lovingly prepared dishes such as roasted venison with bilberry sauce or Murmansk sole with dill potatoes and stewed leeks.
PaninaroITALIAN$$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshaya Zelenina 28; mains R380-780; h9am-11.30pm Mon-Fri, from 11am Sat & Sun; v)
Delightfully off the beaten path, Paninaro is a gem set inside one of the Petrogradky's most striking apartment buildings (don't miss the murals up top – visible on the opposite side of the street). Stop in for tasty house-made pastas topped with grilled vegetables, creative salads and pizzas, and refreshing cocktails.
Lev y PtichkaGEORGIAN$$
(Лев и Птичка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %988-7069; Bolshoy pr 19; Wv)
Amid big fur hats, a lion (lev) mural, decorative wooden chandeliers and other curious design elements, this friendly spot has a loyal local following for its delicious and reasonably priced Georgian fare, including piping hot khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread) fired up at the baker's oven in front. Plates are small and meant for sharing. Entrance is on ul Chaykino.
DINE OR DRINK WITH A VIEW

Making the most of St Petersburg's architectural beauty are these top restaurants, cafes and bars with views:
Koryushka (Корюшка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-640 1616; www.ginza.ru/spb/restaurant/korushka; Petropavlovskaya krepost 3, Zayachy Island; mains R650-2400; hnoon-1am; Wc; mGorkovskaya) Gaze across the Neva towards the Hermitage from this restaurant which serves lightly battered and fried smelt (koryushka), a St Petersburg speciality.
Terrassa ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-640 1616; http://ginza.ru/spb/restaurant/terrassa; Kazanskaya ul 3a; mains R600-1000; h11am-1am, from noon Sat & Sun; Wv; mNevsky Prospekt) Splendid views from the terrace (only open in warmer months) of Kazan Cathedral.
Mansarda (Мансарда MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-946 4303; www.ginza.ru; Pochtamskaya ul 3; mains R590-1690; hnoon-1am; aW; mAdmiralteyskaya) You can almost touch the dome of St Isaac’s Cathedral from the nicest tables here (book in advance).
Solaris Lab ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/solarislab11; per Pirogova 18, 4th fl; h1pm-midnight; mSadovaya) Cafe under a glass, semi-spherical dome with magnificent views over the russet rooftops to the glittering dome of St Isaac's.
Sky Bar ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Top fl, Hotel Azimut, Lermontovsky pr 43/1; h5pm-1am; W; mBaltiyskaya) The top floor of the Soviet Era Azimut Hotel, one of the city's biggest eyesores, is also home to this aptly named bar with a bird's eye view of the city.

6Drinking & Nightlife
A city of midnight hedonists, St Petersburg has plenty of bars, pubs and cafes where you can enjoy a craft beer, an aritsan coffee or a strong cocktail at almost any time of day.
You can drink almost everywhere; even in smart restaurants you’re generally welcome to come in and order just a beer, while the city’s best cocktail bars are superb. The centre of the drinking scene is Dumskaya ul and ul Lomonosova, lined with dive bars and dance clubs and a sea of drunken revellers at the weekends.
Historic Heart
oMod ClubBAR, CLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.modclub.info; nab kanala Griboyedova 7; cover R150-350; h6pm-6am; mNevsky Prospekt)
A popular spot for students and other indie types who appreciate the fun and friendly atmosphere and a cool mix of music both live and spun. Laid-back and great fun, this is a solid choice for a night out.
oCoffee 22CAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/coffeeat22; ul Kazanskaya 22; h8.30am-11pm Mon-Thu, until 1am Fri, 10am-1am Sat, 10am-11pm Sun; W; mNevsky Prospekt)
In an area heavily saturated with hipster cafes, Coffee 22 – with its tattooed baristas and service staff, arty decor (piercing portrait of Joseph Brodsky, a rustic wall of dried mosses) and fashion-forward customers – is perhaps the hippest of them all. Listen to its DJs via its mixcloud.com/coffee22 soundtrack.
oTop HopsCRAFT BEER
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-966-757 0116; www.tophops.ru; nab reki Fontanki 55; h4pm-1am Mon-Thu, 2pm-2am Fri-Sun; W; mGostiny Dvor)
One of the nicer craft-beer bars in town, this riverside space with friendly staff serves up a regularly changing menu of 20 beers on tap and scores more in bottles. The tasty Mexican snacks and food (go for nachos and chilli) go down exceptionally well while you sample your way through their range.
oBorodabarCOCKTAIL BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-911-923 8940; www.facebook.com/Borodabar; Kazanskaya ul 11; h5pm-2am Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat; W; mNevsky Prospekt)
Boroda means beard in Russian, and sure enough you'll see plenty of facial hair and tattoos in this hipster cocktail hang-out. Never mind, as the mixologists really know their stuff – we can particularly recommend their smoked Old Fashioned, which is infused with tobacco smoke, and their colourful (and potent) range of shots.
oApotheke BarCOCKTAIL BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 1535; http://hatgroup.ru/apotheke-bar; ul Lomonosova 1; h8pm-6am Tue-Sun; mGostiny Dvor)
The antithesis of the nearby dive bars, Apotheke is a calm, cosy cocoon for cocktail connoisseurs. Its slogan is 'think what you drink', so there's no official menu but a friendly young bartender, most likely in a white jacket and sporting a hipster moustache, to make suggestions or simply surprise you.
Pif PafBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 6227; http://pifpafhair.wixsite.com/pifpaf; nab kanala Griboyedova 31; h10am-3am Sun-Thu, until 6am Fri & Sat; W; mNevsky Prospekt)
It's a happening bar, it serves a mean burger and there's a hairdresser at the back – should you fancy a new 'do' part-way through the night. Oh, and there's a fussball table, if conversation lags and you fancy a bit of hand-twisting action.
TanzploshchadkaCLUB
(Танцплощадка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tancplo.com; Konyushennaya pl 2a; h8pm-6am Fri & Sat; mNevsky Prospket)
Beloved by beautiful young things, this is the dance club of the moment with a shabby-chic indoor space beneath a lofty vaulted brick ceiling and plenty of outdoor space should it get too hot inside. Find it at the back, through the archway and courtyard complex south of Konyushennaya pl.
Bonch CafeCAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-740 7083; www.bonchcoffee.ru; Bolshaya Morskaya ul 16; h8.30am-midnight Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Coffee is brewed just the way you like it at this pleasantly designed cafe occupying a large corner space in a handy location. It's a great place for breakfast as well as late-night sweet treats as there's 30% off all desserts after 10pm.
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
SECRET BARS & RESTAURANTS

Secret 'speakeasy' style bars and restaurants where you'll need to call or email ahead for the password and directions are hip these days in St Petersburg. These are a couple we like:
Kvartira Kosti KroitsaINTERNATIONAL$$
(Квартира Кости Кройца MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kreutzflat.com; 5th fl, apt 8, ul Marata 1, 921-651 7788; mains R450-730; h24hr; Wv; mMayakovskaya)
A beautifully designed bourgeois hideaway, Kvartira Kosti comprises a stylish restaurant with views over Nevsky pr, a small handsomely designed bar, and a surprising tea salon tucked in the back, with a stained-glass skylight and elegant furnishings set amid a circular room. The menu features Asian-style noodle dishes, creative salads, risotto, fish and chips, and a full breakfast lineup.
oKabinetCOCKTAIL BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-911-921 1944; www.instagram.com/kabinet_bar; Malaya Sadovaya ul 8; h8am-6pm; mGostiny Dvor)
Bookings are essential for this speakeasy cocktail bar styled as a secret poker joint and hidden beneath the Grill Brothers burger restaurant. It's a fun, sophisticated place with the waiters dealing sets of cards to determine your choice of cocktail.
Smolny & Vosstaniya
oHatBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Belinskogo 9; h7pm-5am; mGostiny Dvor)
The wonderfully retro-feeling Hat is a serious spot for jazz and whiskey lovers, who come for the nightly live music and the cool cat crowd that makes this wonderfully designed bar feel like it's been transported out of 1950s Greenwich Village. A very welcome change of gear for St Petersburg's drinking options, but it can be extremely packed at weekends.
oUnion Bar & GrillBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/barunion; Liteyny pr 55; h6pm-4am Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat; W; mMayakovskaya)
The Union is a glamorous and fun place, characterised by one enormous long wooden bar, low lighting and a New York feel. It's all rather adult, with a serious cocktail list and designer beers on tap. The hip 20- and 30-something crowd packs in on weekends to catch live bands, but it's generally quiet during the week.
There's good snack fare (burgers, hummus with pita, shawarma) from the grill in the back room, and a tiny rear patio for the smoking crowd.
oZiferblatANTICAFE
(Циферблат MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-981-180 7022; www.ziferblat.net; 2nd fl, Nevsky pr 81; per min R3, per min after 1st hr R2; h11am-midnight; W; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
A charming multiroom 'free space' that has started a worldwide trend, Ziferblat is the original anticafe in St Petersburg. Coffee, tea, soft drinks and biscuits are included as you while away your time playing chess and other board games, reading, playing instruments (help yourself to the piano and guitar) or just hanging out with the arty young locals who frequent its cosy rooms.
The unsigned entrance is hard to find. Look for the big #81 sign on Nevsky pr, then find the door with buzzers just east of there. Ring Циферблат (labelled in Russian only).
oRedrumBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-416 1126; www.facebook.com/redrumbarspb; ul Nekrasova 26; h4pm-1am Sun-Thu, to 3am Fri & Sat; mMayakovskaya)
One of St Petersburg's best drinking dens, Redrum hits all the right notes. It has a cosy, white brick interior, a welcoming, easygoing crowd, and a stellar selection of craft brews (some two dozen on tap). There's also good pub fare on hand to go with that creative line-up of Session Indian Pale Ales, sour ales, Berliner Weisse and porters.
Have a seat at the small circular bar and get ordering tips from the friendly bartenders, who will be happy to point you in the right direction.
oCommodeBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.commode.club; ul Rubinshteyna 1, 2nd fl; per hr R180; h4pm-2am Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat)
Stopping in for drinks at Commode feels more like hanging out in an upper-class friend's stylish apartment. After getting buzzed up, you can hang out in various high-ceilinged rooms, catch a small concert or poetry slam, browse books in the quasi-library room, play a round of table football, or chat with the easygoing crowd that have fallen for the place.
Drink and snack prices and are kept low (cocktails run R100 to R150), but you'll pay by the hour – not unlike an anticafe – for time spent at this so-called self-cost bar.
ZiferburgANTICAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Fontanki 20; per min R3; h11am-midnight; mGostiny Dvor)
Tucked inside the Golitsyn Loft, this is one of St Petersburg's loveliest spots to while away an afternoon. Elegant furnishings, huge windows and a piano in the corner set the scene. Like other anti-cafes, you'll pay by the minute, with drinks and cookies part of the deal.
The price tops out at R540, meaning you won't pay more than that even if you spend all day here.
Sennaya & Kolomna
Stirka 40BAR
(Стирка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Kazanskaya ul 26; h11am-midnight Sun-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; W; mSennaya Ploshchad)
This friendly joint, whose name means 'washing', has three washing machines, so you can drop off a load and have a few beers while you wait. A novel idea, though one few people seem to take advantage of. Its small and unassuming layout makes it a great place for a quiet drink with a cool young crowd.
SchumliCAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.schumli.ru; Kazanskaya ul 40; h9.30am-10pm Mon-Fri, from noon Sat & Sun; W; mSennaya Ploshchad)
With its large range of coffees, sumptuous selection of cakes and – best of all – freshly made Belgian waffles, this small but friendly cafe is a great place to regain flagging energy when wandering around the city. There's an upstairs dining room for full meals (mains R320 to R640), but coffee with a side of something sweet is the real reason to come.
Vasilyevsky Island
oBeer Boutique 1516CRAFT BEER
(Пивной бутик 1516 MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-328 6066; http://butik1516.ru; 9-ya liniya 55; h3-10pm; mVasileostrovskaya)
Your craft-beer cravings are sure to be satisfied at this bar-cum-bottle shop that has dedicated itself to the best of local and international ales. There's usually around 17 beers on tap and 300 or so in bottles to choose from – so it could be a long night.
oRadosti KofeCAFE
(Радости Кофе MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-925 7222; www.facebook.com/radosticoffee/; nab Makarova 28; h8am-11pm; W; mSportivnaya)
A leafy, relaxed ambience and river views across to the Petrograd Side make this a pleasant pit stop for coffee, other drinks and snacks while touring Vasilyevsky Island. They can make their drinks with soy, almond or hazelnut milk. The menu is available in English.
Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
Big Wine FreaksWINE BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %921-938 6063; Instrumentalnaya ul 3; h6pm-1am Tue-Sat; W)
Boasting a stylish contemporary design, this aptly named place serves an excellent variety of wines from Europe and the New World, plus tasty snacks to go with those tempranillos and chardonnays. Helpful staff – all trained sommeliers – can provide tips on what to order. There's live music, along the lines of acoustic jazz, on Wednesday nights from 8pm.
Double BCAFE
(Даблби MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.double-b.ru; Kronverksky pr; h8am-10pm Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; mGorkovskaya)
One of Petrograd Side's best coffee spots is this hip little cafe on busy Kronverksky pr. Staff can make you a perfect brew with all the essential gadgetry. A green and grey colour scheme, geometric designs, curious lamps and a big picture window make a fine setting for a bit of caffeinated daydreaming.
YasliBAR
(Ясли MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/yaslibar; ul Markina 1; hnoon-midnight Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri & Sat; W; mGorkovskaya)
Tucked down a narrow lane off busy Kronverksky, Yasli makes a fine retreat on chilly nights, with its excellent craft brews on tap and satisfying pub grub (like fish and chips). The setting channels a bit of Brooklyn chic with industrial fixtures and a hip but unpretentious crowd.
Bolshoy BarBAR
(Большой Бар MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshoy pr 45; h9am-1am Sun-Tue, to 4am Wed-Sat; W)
A dapper boxcar-sized spot with old-time music and black-and-white films playing silently in the background, wryly named Bolshoy serves up good coffees by day and first-rate cocktails by night – though daytime drinking isn't discouraged. Slip onto a comfy bar stool and order an Aperol spritz from the talented but bristly bartender.
LGBT ST PETERSBURG

St Petersburg's LGBT nightlife is centred on the large and mainstream club Central Station ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 3600; http://centralstation.ru; ul Lomonosova 1/28; cover after midnight R100-300; h6pm-6am; mNevsky Prospekt) and the more alternative Golubaya Ustritsa ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-921-332 5161; www.boyster.ru; ul Lomonosova 1; h7pm-6am; mGostiny Dvor), a self-styled ‘trash bar’ that guarantees a raucous and cheap night out for anyone. Another option is the long-running Soviet-style club Cabaret (Кабаре MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cabarespb.ru; Razyezzhaya ul 43; cover R300-600; h11pm-6am Thu-Sat; mLigovsky Prospekt) where the 2.30am drag show at weekends is very popular.
There is a busy and growing LGBT scene, but it remains fairly discreet. Gay pride marches are routinely attacked by far right groups and the police often harass protesters. Coming Out (www.comingoutspb.com) is the site of a St Petersburg–based support organisation.
3Entertainment
The classical performing arts are one of the biggest draws in St Petersburg. Highly acclaimed professional artists stage productions in elegant theatres around the city, many of which have been recently revamped and look marvellous.

New StagePERFORMING ARTS
(Новая сцена MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-401 5341; http://alexandrinsky.ru; nab reki Fontanki 49a; mGostiny Dvor)
The New Stage at Alexandrinsky, which opened in 2013, is a strikingly modern building for the historic city center but one that keeps a low profile due to the architect's ingenious use of glass and a secluded courtyard space. Come here to see contemporary dance, music, film, lectures and other events.
oMikhailovsky TheatrePERFORMING ARTS
(Михайловский театр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-595 4305; www.mikhailovsky.ru; pl Iskusstv 1; tickets R500-5000; mNevsky Prospekt)

The Bolshoy Zal (Большой зал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-240 0180; Mikhailovskaya ul 2; mNevsky Prospekt) is the venue for a full program of symphonic performances, while the nearby Maly Zal (Малый Зал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-571 8333; Nevsky pr 30; mGostiny Dvor) hosts smaller ensembles. Both venues are used for numerous music festivals.
Smolny & Vosstaniya
CosmonautLIVE MUSIC
(Космонавт MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cosmonavt.su; ul Bronnitskaya 24; tickets R300-800; W; mTekhnologichesky Institut)
This fantastic conversion of a Soviet-era cinema in a rather nondescript part of town is a great venue for medium-sized concerts and a good place to see live acts in St Petersburg. There’s air-conditioning, which is a godsend in summer, and a very comfortable VIP lounge upstairs, with seating throughout.
Fish FabriqueLIVE MUSIC
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://fishfabrique.ru; Ligovsky pr 53; hnoon-4am daily, concerts from 8pm Thu-Sun; W; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
There are St Petersburg institutions and then there’s Fish Fabrique, the museum of local boho life that has been going for over two decades. Here, in the dark underbelly of Pushkinskaya 10, artists, musicians and counter-culturalists of all ages meet to drink beer and listen to music.
Maly Drama TheatreTHEATRE
(Малый драматический театр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mdt-dodin.ru; ul Rubinshteyna 18; mVladimirskaya)
Also called the Theatre of Europe, the Maly is St Petersburg’s most internationally celebrated theatre. Its director Lev Dodin is famed for his long version of Fyodor Dostoevsky’s The Devils, as well as Anton Chekhov’s Play Without a Name, both of which toured the world to great acclaim. It's also one of the few theatres that does (some) performances with subtitles.
Jazz Philharmonic HallJAZZ
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.jazz-hall.com; Zagorodny pr 27; cover R1200-1500; hconcerts 7pm or 8pm Wed-Sun; mVladimirskaya)
Founded by legendary jazz violinist and composer David Goloshchokin, this venue represents the more traditional side of jazz.

Foreign guests also appear doing mainstream and modern jazz; check the website for details.
JFC Jazz ClubJAZZ
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-272 9850; www.jfc-club.spb.ru; Shpalernaya ul 33; cover R200-500; h7-10pm; mChernyshevskaya)
Very small and very New York, this cool club is the best place in the city to hear modern, innovative jazz music, as well as blues, bluegrass and various other styles (see the website for a list of what’s on). The space is tiny, so book a table online if you want to sit down.
DON'T MISS
MARIINSKY THEATRE

The Mariinsky Theatre (Мариинский театр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-326 4141; www.mariinsky.ru; Teatralnaya pl 1; tickets R1200-6500; mSadovaya) has played a pivotal role in Russian ballet and opera ever since it was built in 1859 and remains one of Russia's most loved and respected cultural institutions. Its pretty green-and-white main building on aptly named Teatralnaya pl (Theatre Sq) is a must for any visitor wanting to see one of the world's great ballet and opera stages, while its newer second stage, the Mariinsky II (Мариинский II MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-326 4141; www.mariinsky.ru; ul Dekabristov 34; tickets R350-6000; hticket office 11am-7pm; mSadovaya), is a state-of-the-art opera house for the 21st century.
The best way to experience these buildings is to see an opera or ballet. Outside performance times you can wander into the theatre’s foyer and maybe peep into the lovely auditorium. Private tours are sometimes available – ask at the main ticket office if these are running during your visit.
Known as the Kirov Ballet during the Soviet era, the Mariinsky has an illustrious history, with troupe members including such ballet greats as Nijinsky, Nureyev, Pavlova and Baryshnikov. In recent years the company has been invigorated by the current Artistic and General Director Valery Gergiev. It is pretty certain that the Mariinsky Theatre will close at some point in 2018 or 2019 for a full (and, again, much needed) renovation, so visit the building's faded grandeur while you can.
Sennaya & Kolomna
Rimsky-Korsakov ConservatoryCLASSICAL MUSIC
(Консерватория имени Н. А. Римского-Корсакова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 2519; www.conservatory.ru; Teatralnaya pl 3; tickets R300-2000; mSadovaya)
This illustrious music school was the first public music school in Russia. The Bolshoy Zal (Big Hall) on the 3rd floor is an excellent place to see performances by up-and-coming musicians throughout the academic year, while the Maly Zal (Small Hall) often hosts free concerts from present students and alumni; check when you’re in town for what’s on.
Mariinsky Concert HallCLASSICAL MUSIC
(Мариинский концертный зал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mariinsky.ru; ul Dekabristov 37; tickets R700-1800; hticket office 11am-8pm; mSadovaya)
Opened in 2007, this concert hall is a magnificent multifaceted creation. It manages to preserve the historic brick facade of the set and scenery warehouse that previously stood on this spot, while the modern main entrance, facing ul Dekabristov, is all tinted glass and angular lines, hardly hinting at the beautiful old building behind.
Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
Hi-HatLIVE PERFORMANCE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/hihatrooftop; Aptekarsky pr 4; mPetrogradskaya)
On the rooftop of an art cluster near the Botanical Gardens, Hi-Hat hosts nights of live music, DJs and open-air film screenings. The creative line-up and open-air setting draws out style mavens and a party-minded crowd. The schedule is erratic, but events typically run from 5pm or 6pm to around 1am on Fridays and Saturdays (with the odd Sunday and Thursday happening). Check the website for the schedule.
A2LIVE MUSIC

KamchatkaCLUB, LIVE MUSIC
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.clubkamchatka.ru; ul Blokhina 15; cover R250-350; h7pm-2am; mSportivnaya)
A shrine to Viktor Tsoy, the late Soviet-era rocker who worked as caretaker of this former boilerhouse bunker with band mates from Kino. Music lovers flock here to light candles and watch a new generation thrash out their stuff. The line-up is varied and it's worth dropping by if only for a quick drink in this highly atmospheric place – find it tucked in a courtyard off the street.
7Shopping

oAu Pont RougeDEPARTMENT STORE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://aupontrouge.ru; nab reki Moyki 73-79; h10am-10pm; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Dating from 1906–7, the one-time Esders and Scheefhaals department store has been beautifully restored and is one of the most glamorous places to shop in the city.

DON'T MISS
HISTORIC SHOPS OF NEVSKY PROSPEKT

Nikolai Gogol described it as 'Petersburg's universal channel of communication' in his story Nevsky Prospekt. Some 300 years on from its creation, little has changed. Nevsky remains the city's most famous street, running 4.7km from the Admiralty to the Alexandr Nevsky Monastery, from which it takes its name. Taking a stroll along it is an essential St Petersburg experience and particularly special at dusk as the low light casts shadows and picks out silhouettes from the elegant mix of architecture.
The inner 2.5km to Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal) is the city's prime shopping drag that pulses with street life. Here you'll find baroque palaces, churches in a range of denominations, all manner of entertainments and, above all, shops, some historic in their own right. These are the key ones not to miss:
ASinger Building ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 28; mNevsky Prospekt) The former headquarters of the Singer sewing machine company, which opened a factory in the Russian capital in 1904, is one of St Petersburg’s most gorgeous buildings. Its Style Modern architecture, designed by Pavel Suzor, and topped with a glass tower and scuplture, also housed the American consulate for a few years prior to WWI. It's possible to access the offices part of the building including the interior of the glass dome on a tour (R6000 for up to three people) organised with Placemates (%925 845 3747; http://placemates.ru; prices vary).
ABolshoy Gostiny Dvor (Большой Гостиный Двор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-630 5408; http://bgd.ru; Nevsky pr 35; h10am-10pm; mGostiny Dvor) One of the world’s first indoor shopping malls, the ‘Big Merchant Yard’ dates from between 1757 and 1785 and stretches 230m along Nevsky pr (its perimeter is more than 1km long). This Rastrelli creation is not as elaborate as some of his other work, finished as it was by Vallin de la Mothe in a more sober neoclassical style. At its height at the turn of the 20th century, Gostiny Dvor contained over 170 shops.
APassage (Пассаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-313 7400; http://passage.spb.ru; Nevsky pr 48; h10am-9pm; mGostiny Dvor) Built between 1846 and 1848, this arcade has a glass roof spanning the entire block from Nevsky to Italiyanskaya ul. Dostoevsky wrote a story about a man who was swallowed by a crocodile in Passage, after a live crocodile was exhibited here in 1864. Look for the small exhibition on the 1st floor with historical photos and other items related to the arcade. The handsomely restored ground floor has several good souvenir and antique shops.
AKupetz Eliseevs ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-456 6666; www.kupetzeliseevs.ru; Nevsky pr 56; h10am-11pm; W; mGostiny Dvor) This Style Moderne stunner is St Petersburg's most elegant grocery store. Built in 1904 as the flagship of the Eliseev Brothers' highly successful chain of food emporiums, little expense or design flourish was spared in its construction. In recent years the building has been restored to its full grandeur with huge plate-glass windows providing glimpses into a dazzling interior of stained glass, chandeliers, polished brass and a giant pineapple palm. The building's exterior is no less lavish, graced with four allegorical sculptures representing industry, trade and commerce, art and science. The building also included a theatre, which is still functioning.
Smolny & Vosstaniya
PhonotekaMUSIC
(Фонотека MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.phonoteka.ru; ul Marata 28; h10am-10pm; mMayakovskaya)
This cool store will thrill anyone interested in music and cinema, as it sells a very cool range of vinyls from all eras (it’s particularly strong on rare Soviet discs), a great selection of CDs from around the world and a discerning choice of film and documentary on DVD, making it an excellent place to buy Russian films.
AngliaBOOKS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Fontanki 30; h10am-8pm Mon-Fri, from 11am Sat, noon-7pm Sun; mGostiny Dvor)
The city’s only dedicated English-language bookshop has a good selection of contemporary literature, classics, dictionaries, history and travel writing – plus a dedicated section on Russia. It also hosts small art and photography displays, organises book readings and generally is a cornerstone of expat life in St Petersburg.
Imperial PorcelainHOMEWARES
(Императорский Фарфор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.ipm.ru; Vladimirsky pr 7; h10am-8pm; mVladimirskaya)
This is one of many convenient city-centre locations of the famous porcelain factory that once made tea sets for the Romanovs. If you’re determined to get a bargain, head out to the factory outlet (Императорский Фарфор GOOGLE MAP ; www.ipm.ru; pr Obukhovsky Oborony 151; h10am-8pm; mLomonosovskaya) where prices are a bit cheaper.
GaleriaSHOPPING CENTRE
(Галерея MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.galeria.spb.ru; Ligovsky pr 30A; h10am-11pm; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
This extraordinary place has rather changed everything for shopping in St Petersburg – there are probably as many shops here as elsewhere in the entire city centre. Spread over five floors, with around 300 shops (including H&M, Michael Kors, Marks & Spencer, Kiehl's and Zara), this really is a one-stop shop for pretty much all your shopping needs.
Sennaya & Kolomna
RediskаARTS & CRAFTS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Grazhdanskaya ul 13, Berthold Centre; hnoon-10pm; mSadovaya)
Near the courtyard of the Berthold Centre, this delightful shop has lots of eye-catching objects, much of it made in-house or produced by St Petersburg artisans. You'll find jewellery imprinted with famous paintings, whimsical wooden clocks, ceramics, tiny Konstructor kits (a kind of miniature Lego), artfully painted flasks, backpacks, sunglasses and handmade soaps, lotions and candles.
NorthwayGIFTS & SOUVENIRS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Angliyskaya nab 36/2; h9am-8pm; mAdmiralteyskaya)
There is quite simply no bigger collection of matryoshki (nesting dolls), amber, fur and other Russian souvenir staples than that on offer at this very impressive and stylish shop right on the Neva embankment. Look no further for Russian gifts to take home.
WORTH A TRIP
UDELNAYA FAIR

This weekend market (Удельная ярмарка GOOGLE MAP ; Skobolvesky pr, Vyborg Side; h8am-5pm Sat & Sun; mUdelnaya) is a treasure trove of Soviet ephemera, prerevolutionary antiques, WWII artefacts and bonkers kitsch from all eras is truly worth travelling to see. Exit the metro station to the right and follow the crowds across the train tracks. Continue beyond the large permanent market, which is of very little interest, until you come to a huge area of independent stalls, all varying in quality and content.
8Information
DANGER & ANNOYANCES
AForeigners tend to find Russians quite brusque and even unfriendly. Remember, this is a cultural thing, and try not to be offended by it. Russians take a while to warm up, but when they do they're exceptionally friendly.
AThere has been an ongoing epidemic of racist attacks in St Petersburg. If you look very obviously non-Russian, it's a good idea to avoid the suburbs and take taxis at night.
ADue to legislation criminalising the 'promotion of homosexuality' to minors, levels of homophobia are higher now than they have been for some time. Gay travellers are advised to remain discreet.
DISCOUNT CARDS
If you’re a student, bring an International Student Identity Card (ISIC) to get discounts – cards issued by non-Russian universities will not always be accepted. The Hermitage is the blissful exception, where anyone with a student card from any country gets in for free. Senior citizens (usually anyone over the age of 60) are often also eligible for discounts, so bring your passport with you as proof of age.
The St Petersburg Card (https://petersburgcard.com) is sold online and by the St Petersburg Tourist Centre. It gives a range of discounts on tours and sights such as the Hermitage, Peterhof and Tsarskoe Selo (the savings aren't huge), as well as acting as a stored-value card for public transport.
EMERGENCY

Fire Department	%01
Police	%02
INTERNET ACCESS
Internet access is excellent and practically universal. Nearly all hotels have free wireless internet. Many restaurants, cafes, bars and clubs also have wi-fi. You may have to ask for a password (parol) to get online, and also input your mobile phone number. Sometimes this will need to be a Russian number (ie one starting with 7); if you don't have one, ask a local if you can use their number.
MEDIA
There is no English-language newspaper but the free bimonthly In Your Pocket (www.inyourpocket.com) magazine is worth picking up for events listings and other background information.
MEDICAL SERVICES
Clinics
These private clinics have facilities of an international standard and are pricey, but generally accept major international insurance policies, including direct billing.
American Medical Clinic ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-740 2090; www.amclinic.ru; nab reki Moyki 78; h24hr; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Euromed ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-327 0301; www.euromed.ru; Suvorovsky pr 60; h24hr; mChernyshevskaya)

Pharmacies
Apteka Petrofarm ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-571 3767; www.petropharm6.webapteka.ru; Nevsky pr 22-24; h24hr)
A chain of 24-hour pharmacies called 36.6 Pharmacy (www.366.ru) has many branches around the city, including in the Historic Centre ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-324 2666; Gorokhovaya ul 16; h9am-9pm Mon-Fri, 10am-9pm Sat & Sun; mAdmiralteyskaya). Other convenient pharmacies include Raduga, with branches in the Petrograd Side (Радуга MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshoy pr 62; h9am-10pm Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; mPetrogradskaya) and Smolny ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-275 8189; Nevsky pr 98; h24hr; mMayakovskaya).
MONEY
ATMs are everywhere and debit and credit cards are accepted in most places. Still, it's always a good idea to carry some cash.
POST
To send parcels home, head to the elegant main post office ( GOOGLE MAP ; Pochtamtskaya ul 9; mAdmiralteyskaya). Smaller post offices may refuse to send parcels internationally; most importantly, your package is more likely to reach its destination if you send it from the main post office. You will need to provide a return address in St Petersburg – your hotel name will be fine.
TOILETS
Around nearly all metro stations and tourist attractions there’s at least one blue Portakabin-type toilet staffed by an attendant who will charge you around R35 for the honour of using it. There are also pay toilets in all main-line train stations and free ones in museums. As a general rule, it’s far better to stop for a drink in a cafe or duck into a fancy hotel and use their cleaner facilities.
TOURIST INFORMATION
Tourist information is halfway decent in St Petersburg. In addition to the Tourist Information Bureau's main office ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-303 0555, 812-242 3909; http://eng.ispb.info; Sadovaya ul 14/52; h10am-7pm Mon-Sat; mGostiny Dvor), just off Nevsky pr in the Historic Heart, there is an office in Smolny ( GOOGLE MAP ; pl Vosstaniya; h10am-7pm; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), and kiosks at Palace Square ( GOOGLE MAP ; %8-931-326 5744; Dvortsovaya pl; h10am-7pm; mAdmiralteyskaya), St Isaac's Cathedral ( GOOGLE MAP ; Isaakievskaya pl; h10am-7pm; mAdmiralteyskaya) and Pulkovo Airport ( GOOGLE MAP ; h9am-8pm).

8Getting There & Away
AIR
Most travellers arrive in St Petersburg at Pulkovo International Airport (LED; GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 3822; www.pulkovoairport.ru; Pulkovskoye sh), 23km south of the city. This terminal building, which opened in 2014, and is confusingly still referred to as Terminal 1, handles all domestic and international flights and is St Petersburg's only airport.
BOAT
Cruise ships dock at one of the following:
Marine Facade Terminal (Пассажирский Порт Санкт-Петербург Морской Фасад GOOGLE MAP ; %812-303 6740; www.portspb.ru; 1 Bereg Nevskoy gubi; mPrimorskaya)
Sea Port (Морской вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 2060; www.mvokzal.ru; pl Morskoy Slavy 1)
English Embankment Passenger Terminal ( GOOGLE MAP )
Lieutenant Schmidt Passenger Terminal ( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
St Petersburg Sea Port (Морской порт Санкт-Петербурга GOOGLE MAP ; www.seaport.spb.ru; Mezhevoy kanal 5)
River Passenger Terminal (Речной вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; %812-262 6321, 812-262 0239; Obukhovskoy Oborony pr 195; mProletarskaya)
You can buy ferry tickets for nearly all boats at the Ferry Centre (Паромный центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-327 3377; www.paromy.ru; ul Vosstaniya 19; h10am-7pm Mon-Fri; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), a short walk from the Moscow Station. Alternatively, it’s possible to buy ferry tickets in the Sea Port, as well as online through the ferry companies themselves.
BUS
St Petersburg’s main bus station, Avtovokzal (Автобусный вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; %812-766 5777; www.avokzal.ru; nab Obvodnogo kanala 36; mObvodny Kanal), has bus connections to cities all over western Russia, including Veliky Novgorod, but most travellers won’t use it. If you do happen to arrive here, it’s a short walk along the canal to the metro station Obvodny Kanal (Line 5).
Lux Express ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-441 3757; www.luxexpress.eu; nab Obvodnogo kanala 36; h9am-9pm; mBaltiyskaya) runs buses from both Avtovokzal and from outside the Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal). Its buses run to Tallinn (from R1950, seven daily, seven hours), Rīga (from R2275, four daily, 11 hours) and Helsinki (from R1650, three daily, 7½ hours).
Ecolines ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-409 9410; www.ecolines.ru; Podezdny per 3; h8am-10pm; mPushkinskaya) runs daily buses from the Vitebsk Station to Tallinn (R1210, five daily, seven hours), Rīga (R2240, four daily, 11 hours), Minsk (R2130, three daily, 14 hours), Prague (R6130, two to three daily, 36 to 38 hours) and Berlin (R6840, two to three daily, 34 hours).
Transgold (%812-995 0605; www.transgold.ru) runs door-to-door marshrutky (minibuses) to and from Helsinki and other destinations in Finland from R1300.
CAR & MOTORCYCLE
The most convenient border crossing from Estonia when driving to St Petersburg is Narva. You can avoid queues by booking a time slot for your crossing from (but not into) Estonia for a small fee at www.estonianborder.eu.
Heading to the city from Finland, highways cross the Finnish border posts of Nuijamaa and Vaalimaa (Brusnichnoe and Torfyanovka, respectively, on the Russian side).
TRAIN
Buying train tickets in person can be done at any train station (even at a different terminus from where your train departs), although waiting time can be long if you buy them at a counter. Far quicker are the ticket machines, which all work in English and where you can usually pay in both cash and by credit card. Another option is the centrally located Train Tickets Centre (Кассы ЖД GOOGLE MAP ; nab kanala Griboyedova 24; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, until 6pm Sun; mGostiny Dvor), where there are also ticket machines, which makes waiting in line unnecessary.
HISTORIC RAILWAY STATIONS

As the birthplace of Russia’s railway system, it’s not surprising that St Petersburg has some grand stations. The oldest and most elegant is the Vitebsk Station (Vitebsky vokzal; Витебский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; Zagorodny pr 52; mPushkinskaya), originally built in 1837 for the tsar’s private train line to Tsarskoe Selo. The current building dates from 1904 and is partly graced with gorgeous Style Moderne interiors.
While you’re at the Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal; Московский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; www.moskovsky-vokzal.ru; Nevsky pr 85; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), look up at the expansive ceiling mural in the main entrance hall. There’s also a striking giant bust of Peter the Great in the hall leading to the platforms.
The Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal; Финляндский вокзал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Lenina 6; mPloshchad Lenina), rebuilt in the 1970s in rectilinear Soviet style, is where Lenin finally arrived in 1917 after 17 years in exile abroad. Here he gave his legendary speech from the top of an armoured car to a crowd who had heard of, but never seen the man. After fleeing a second time he again arrived here from Finland, this time disguised as a railway fireman, and the locomotive he rode in is displayed behind glass on the platform. Walk out onto the square that still bears Lenin’s name and you’ll see a marvellous statue of the man himself at the far end.
Stations
Trains from Helsinki arrive at the Finland Station. From here you can connect to anywhere in the city by metro from the Ploshchad Lenina station (Line 1) on the square outside the station.
Some trains from the Leningradskaya Oblast and those from Helsinki to Moscow stop en route in St Petersburg at the Ladoga Station (Ladozhsky vokzal; Ладожский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://lvspb.ru; Zanevsky pr 73; mLadozhskaya) (Ladozhsky vokzal). It’s served by the Ladozhskaya metro station (Line 4).
If you’re arriving from Moscow, you’ll come to the Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal), in the centre of the city. There are two metro stations close by: pl Vosstaniya (Line 1) and Mayakovskaya (Line 3). To get here (you can enter both stations through one building) turn left outside the main entrance to the Moscow Station, and the exit is on one side of the building on Ligovsky pr.
Moscow
There are about 10 overnight trains travelling between St Petersburg and Moscow. Most depart between 10pm and 1am, arriving in the capital the following morning between 6am and 8am. On the more comfortable firmeny trains, such as the Red Arrow (Красная стрела) or Grand Express (ГРАНД ЭКСПРЕСС) a de-luxe sleeping carriage is between R12,800 and R16,400, 1st-class compartment (two-person cabin) around R16,300, while a 2nd-class kupe (four-person cabin) is R2800. Less fancy trains offer 3rd-class platzkartny (dorm-style sleeping carriages) for R1570 and even sitting-only carriages for R890.
Sapsan high-speed trains travel at 200km/h to reach Moscow in around four hours. There are six to eight daily departures. Comfortable 2nd-class seats start at R1300, while super-spacious 1st-class seats run from R5000.
Elsewhere in Russia
St Petersburg has excellent connections to the rest of European Russia, with daily trains to Murmansk, Petrozavodsk, Kaliningrad, Nizhny Novgorod, Novgorod, Pskov and Yekaterinburg. Less frequent services connect the city to Arkhangelsk and Kazan. Southern Russia and Siberia are generally reached via Moscow, although there are some direct trains to the Black Sea coast from St Petersburg. However, be aware that these cut through Belarus, necessitating a transit visa for Belarus and a double entry visa.
Finland & Other International Destinations
From Helsinki there are four daily Allegro express trains that take you from the Finnish capital to St Petersburg in an impressive 3½ hours; see www.vr.fi for prices and timetables. Services in both directions stop at Vyborg.
St Petersburg is well connected by train to lots of cities throughout Eastern Europe, including Berlin, Budapest, Kaliningrad, Kyiv, Prague and Warsaw, but all trains pass through Belarus, for which you’re required to hold a transit visa. The train to Smolensk in Russia also passes through Belarus.
8Getting Around
TO/FROM THE AIRPORT
An official taxi to the centre should cost between R800 and R1000; if you book one via an app, it's likely to be R700. Alternatively, take bus 39 (35 minutes) or 39A (20 minutes) to Moskovskaya metro station for R35, then take the metro from Moskovskaya (Line 2) all over the city for R45.
BICYCLE
Despite the local traffic being still in the learning stages about basic respect for cyclists, this is a great way to get around this huge and flat city.
Some youth hostels and bike shops, such as Rentbike ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-981 0155; www.rentbike.org; Naberezhnaya fontanki 77; per hr/day from R100/500; h10am-10pm; mSennaya Ploshchad) and Skladnye Velosipedy (Складные Велосипеды MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-748 1407; www.shulzbikes.ru; Goncharnaya ul 20; bike hire per day/24 hr R700/1000; h11am-9pm), hire bikes for as little as R500 per day.
If you're keen to do a lot of cycling, bring a helmet, bike lights and a good lock from home, as these are hard to come by.
Velogorod (%812-648 2100; http://spb.velogorod.org; ride/day pass R45/129) is a handy bike-sharing system with 56 stations across the city. You'll need to use the website or download the app to hire one of their bicycles.
BUS, MARSHRUTKA, TROLLEYBUS & TRAM
Buses and, particularly marshrutky (minibuses), are a very handy way to get around the city and they tend to cover routes that the metro doesn’t, making them essential for certain parts of town. Most travellers find taking them a bit daunting, however, as there’s little signage in English. On both buses and trolleybuses, you get on and then pay a conductor; the fare is R40. Marshrutky rates are usually posted on the inside of the bus near the driver.
Increasingly rare, trams are still useful in areas such as Kolomna and Vasilyevsky Island where there is little else available.
Useful routes include:
Tram 6 Great for travelling between areas north of the river without going through the centre: connects Vasilyevsky Island with the Petrograd Side and the Vyborg Side.
Trolleybus 7 Goes from Smolny along Nevsky pr, over the river, along the Strelka and to the Petrograd Side.
CAR
You can hire cars from the major international agencies such as Avis ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-600 1213; www.avisrussia.ru; pl Alexandra Nevskogo 2; h9am-9pm; mpl Alexandra Nevskogo) and Hertz ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-454 7099; www.hertz.ru; Pulkovskoe sh 41) as well as local operations to get around the city and further afield.
For something a little different, you can rent vintage cars, including retro Soviet models such as Chaikas and Volgas, from Retro v Mode (Ретро в моде MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-927 1837; www.retrovmode.ru; office 16, Korpus 6, Ligovsky pr 50; h10am-1pm & 2-8pm). Rates start around R1500 per hour and they can also arrange drivers.
METRO
The St Petersburg Metro (%8-800- 350 1155; www.metro.spb.ru; h6am-12.45am) is a very efficient five-line system. The network of some 70 stations is most usefully employed for travelling long distances, especially connecting the suburbs to the city centre. New stations are being added and it's possible that the one at Teatralnaya, next to the Mariinsky Theatre, will be operational by 2020.
Look for signs with a big blue ‘M’ signifying the entrance to the metro. The flat fare for a trip is R45; you will have to buy an additional ticket if you are carrying a significant amount of baggage. If you wish to buy a single journey, ask for ‘adin proyezd’ and you will be given a zheton (token) to put in the machine.
If you are staying more than a day or two, however, it’s worth buying a smart card (R60), which is good for multiple journeys to be used over the course of a fixed time period – for example, 10 trips in seven days for R355. Their main advantage is that you won’t have to line up to buy tickets – the ticket counters can have very long lines during peak hours.
The metro system is fully signed in English, so it’s quite easy to use, even for first-timers in Russia.
TAXI
Taxi apps, such as Gett and Yandex Taxi, are all the rage in St Petersburg and they've brought down the prices of taxis in general, while improving the service a great deal.
Aside from the apps, the best way to get a taxi is to order it by phone. Operators will usually not speak English, so unless you speak Russian, ask your hotel reception to call a taxi for you. It also remains possible to flag down a random car in the street and negotiate the price, keeping in mind all security caveats.
Peterburgskoe Taksi 068 (%812-324 7777, in St Petersburg 068; www.taxi068.ru)
Taxi-4 (%812-333 4333; www.taxi-4.ru)
Taxi Blues (Такси-Блюз %812-321 8888; www.taxiblues.ru)
Taxi 6000000 (%812-600 0000; http://6-000-000.ru) Has operators and drivers who speak English.

RAISING THE BRIDGES

From mid-April until late November major bridges across the Neva rise roughly between 1.30am and 5am to allow ships to sail through the city. Check the timetable at www.razvodka-mostov.ru (in Russian only). Because of the new fixed suspension bridges on the Western High Speed Diameter highway across the mouth of the Neva you will not be stuck either side of the river when the bridges go up. Note also that between May and the end of November the M5 metro line shuttles every 20 minutes back and forth between Admiralteyskaya and Sportivnaya stations between 1am and 3am on Saturday and Sunday and the eve of public holidays, creating an easy way to get between the islands and the Historic Heart.

AROUND ST PETERSBURG
There are several grand imperial palaces and estates surrounding St Petersburg. Peterhof and the palace-park ensembles at Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk are the best and a visit to St Petersburg is not complete without a trip to at least one of them. Be warned that at the height of summer the endless tourist crowds can be frustrating. Moreover, while Peterhof is the most impressive palace, it’s overpriced for foreigners. Tsarskoe Selo is the best value-for-money day trip.
If your time is short, or you wish to avoid the long queues at the palaces, book yourself into a guided tour of Peterhof, Tsarskoe Selo or Pavlovsk with a travel agency, and make sure that they book your entry ticket for you. Peter’s Walking Tours in St Petersburg can do this for you.

Peterhof Петергоф
%812 / POP 73,400
Hugging the Gulf of Finland, 29km west of St Petersburg, Peterhof – the ‘Russian Versailles’ – is a far cry from the original cabin Peter the Great had built here to oversee construction of the Kronshtadt naval base. Peter liked the place so much he built a villa, Monplaisir, here and then a whole series of palaces and ornate gardens. Peterhof was renamed Petrodvorets (Peter’s Palace) in 1944 but has since reverted to its original name. The palace and buildings are surrounded by leafy gardens and a spectacular ensemble of gravity-powered fountains.
What you see today is largely a reconstruction, as Peterhof was a major casualty of WWII. Apart from the damage done by the Germans, the palace suffered the worst under Soviet bombing raids in December 1941 and January 1942, because Stalin was determined to thwart Hitler’s plan of hosting a New Year’s victory celebration here.
1Sights
oLower ParkPARK
(Нижний парк GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhofmuseum.ru; adult/student May-Oct R750/400, Nov-Apr free; h9am-7pm)
One of the greatest attractions outside of St Petersburg is the jaw-dropping collection of gilded fountains, statue-lined lanes, and picturesque canals that make up the Lower Park of Peterhof. Even if you'd rather not brave the crowds to visit the palace, it's still well worth a visit here, to see its over-the-top Grand Cascade ( GOOGLE MAP ; h11am-5pm Mon-Fri, to 6pm Sat & Sun May-Oct) and other water features, including trick fountains that douse unsuspecting visitors.
oGrand PalacePALACE
(Большой дворец GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhofmuseum.ru; ul Razvodnaya; adult/student R700/400, audio guide R600; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun, closed last Tue of month)
The Grand Palace is an imposing building, although with just 30-something rooms, it is not nearly as large as your typical tsarist palace. From the start of June to the end of September it is open to foreign tourists only between noon and 2pm, and again from 4.15pm to 5.45pm (to 7.45pm on Saturdays), due to guided tours being only in Russian at other times (it is quite possible to leave your group, however).
While Peter’s palace was relatively modest, Rastrelli grossly enlarged the building for Empress Elizabeth. Later, Catherine the Great toned things down a little with a redecoration, although that’s not really apparent from the glittering halls and art-filled galleries that are visible today. All the paintings, furniture and chandeliers are original, as everything was removed from the premises before the Germans arrived in WWII. The Chesme Hall is full of huge paintings of Russia’s destruction of the Turkish fleet at Çesme in 1770. Other highlights include the exquisite East and West Chinese Cabinets, the Picture Hall and Peter’s Study. The Throne Room is the biggest in the palace, with Peter's red velvet throne as centrepiece, while the Picture Hall lives up to its name, with hundreds of portraits crowding its walls.
After WWII, Peterhof was largely left in ruins. Hitler had intended to throw a party here when his plans to occupy the Astoria Hotel were thwarted. He drew up pompous invitations, which obviously incensed his Soviet foes. Stalin’s response was to pre-empt any such celebration by bombing the estate himself, in the winter of 1941–42, so it is ironic but true that most of the damage at Peterhof occurred at the hands of the Soviets. What you see today is largely a reconstruction; the main palace was completely gutted and only a few of its walls were left standing.
Park AlexandriaPARK
(Парк Александрия GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R300/200; h9am-10pm)
Even on summer weekends, the rambling and overgrown Park Alexandria is peaceful and practically empty. Built for Tsar Nicholas I (and named for his tsarina), these grounds offer a sweet retreat from the crowds. Originally named for Alexander Nevsky, the Gothic chapel ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R300/200; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun) was completed in 1834 as the private chapel of Nicholas I. Nearby is the cottage (Коттедж GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun) that was built around the same time as his summer residence.
PETERHOF TICKETS & OPENING HOURS

Inexplicably, many museums within the Peterhof estate have different closing days, although all the buildings are open from Friday to Sunday. With the exception of the Grand Palace, most buildings are open only at weekends between October and April, and some are closed entirely out of season. In any case, it’s extraordinarily expensive to see all the attractions from the inside, as they each charge separate hefty admission fees, plus an extra ticket to take photographs or videos – on top of which you’re paying at least 75% more than locals. There are some joint tickets to several sights, which save you something, but sadly there's no general ticket available. Nearly all tours and posted information is in Russian, so it’s worth investing in an information booklet, available at the kiosks near the entrances.
The lovely Upper Garden is free. Admission to the Lower Park is payable at the cash booths on the jetty and outside the gates leading to the Grand Cascade. There's no re-entering the park; if you leave the grounds, you'll have to purchase another ticket to get back in.

This large and upmarket restaurant overlooks the Gulf of Finland, just west of the boat dock, with plenty of seating both inside and out. It has a large and meaty menu full of filling but interesting Russian classics.
Grand OrangerieRUSSIAN$$
( GOOGLE MAP ; Lower Park; set menus R450-800; h11am-8pm)
This cafe in the orangery is a fine choice for lunch. It gets busy, though, so you may have to queue for a spot. It has a cafeteria-style counter where you can pick out your Russian classics; don't neglect the cake selection.
8Getting There & Away
It’s easy and cheap to reach Peterhof by bus or marshrutka. Marshrutka 300, 424 and 424A (R80) leave from outside the Avtovo metro station, while marshrutka 103 leaves from outside Leninsky Prospekt station. All pass through the town of Peterhof, immediately outside the palace. Tell the driver you want to go ‘vo dvaryéts’ (‘to the palace’) and you’ll be let off near the main entrance to the Upper Garden, on Sankt-Peterburgsky pr.
There’s also a reasonably frequent suburban train (R60, 40 minutes) from Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) to Novy Peterhof, from where you can walk (around 30 minutes), or take any bus except 357 to the fifth stop, which will take another 10 minutes.
From May to September, the Peterhof Express ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhof-express.com; single/return adult R800/1500, student R600/1000; h10am-6pm) hydrofoil departs from the jetty in front of the Admiralty every 30 minutes from 9am. It’s an expensive but highly enjoyable way to get to Peterhof, and you arrive right in front of the palace. The last hydrofoil leaves Peterhof at 7pm, and the trip takes 30 minutes.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
ORANIENBAUM ОРАНИЕНБАУМ

Oranienbaum (Orange Tree), the palace of Peter the Great's right-hand man Alexander Menshikov is 5km down the coast from Peterhof. The buildings are part of the Unesco World Heritage Site, and provide a fine window into Russia’s imperial past. The surrounding park (Музей-заповедник Ораниенбаум GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhofmuseum.ru; h9am-8pm) is worth a visit in its own right, with beautifully landscaped paths amid the lakes and greenery.
Menshikov’s impressive palace (Большой Меншиковский Дворец GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R400/250; h10.30am-6pm Wed-Mon) underwent a full restoration and reopened its state rooms in 2014. Most of the interiors are restorations of the 19th century ones, so reflect the taste of the various Romanovs who used the palace, rather than Menshikov himself, of whom there is no trace.
Among the other buildings in the park open to the public is the Chinese Palace (Китайский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun). Built for Catherine the Great as her private residence at Oranienbaum, this over-the-top rococo palace, designed by Antonio Rinaldi, is distinctly un-Chinese looking and, in fact, gets its name from its chinoiserie interiors, which feature painted ceilings and fine inlaid-wood floors and walls.
Opposite Oranienbaum's main entrance, Okhota (Охота GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovy pr 65a; mains R480-1220; hnoon-9pm Mon-Thu, to midnight Fri-Sun) serves up hearty fare in a traditional Russian environment. It's big on taxidermy for its hunting-themed decor.
Trains from St Petersburg’s Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) to Peterhof continues to Oranienbaum (R81, one hour). Get off at Lomonosov Station and walk diagonally across the little park in front, keep going up to the main road, turn right, pass the unmissable Archangel Michael Cathedral, and you’ll reach the park entrance on your left. Alternatively you can take marshrutky 300, 424 or 424A to Lomonosov (R70) from outside metro Avtovo. Get off at the Archangel Michael Cathedral and follow the park perimeter to the left until you reach the entrance.
Pushkin (Tsarskoe Selo) Пушкин (Царское Село)
%812 / POP 106,100
The grand imperial estate of Tsarskoe Selo in the town of Pushkin, 25km south of St Petersburg, is often combined on a day trip with the palace and sprawling park at Pavlovsk, 4km further south. It’s a great combination, but start out early as there’s lots to see: Pushkin can easily be a full-day trip in itself.
The railway that connects Pushkin and Pavlovsk with St Petersburg was Russia’s first, opened in 1837 to carry the imperial family between here and the then capital. The town changed its name to Pushkin in 1937 after Russia’s favourite poet, who studied here and whose school and dacha you can also visit. While the palace and park complex's name has reverted to Tsarskoe Selo (The Tsar's Village), the town remains proudly named for the national bard.

(Екатерининский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tzar.ru; Sadovaya ul 7; adult/student R1000/350, audio guide R150; h10am-4.45pm Wed-Sun)
The centrepiece of Tsarskoe Selo, created under Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine the Great between 1744 and 1796, is the vast baroque Catherine Palace, designed by Rastrelli and named after Peter the Great’s second wife. The palace can only be visited by individuals between noon and 2pm, and 4pm and 4.45pm, otherwise it's reserved for pre-booked tour groups, such is its rightful popularity. The audio guide is well worth taking, as it gives detailed explanation of what you'll see in each room.
As at the Winter Palace, Catherine the Great had many of Rastrelli’s original interiors remodelled in classical style. Most of the gaudy exterior and 20-odd rooms of the palace have been beautifully restored – compare them to the photographs of the devastation left by the Germans.
The interiors are superb, with highlights including the Great Hall, the Arabesque Hall, the baroque Cavalier's Dining Room, the White State Dining Room, the Crimson and Green Pilaster Rooms, the Portrait Hall and, of course, the world-famous Amber Room. The panels used in the latter were a gift given to Peter the Great, but not put to any use until 1743 when Elizabeth decided to use them decoratively, after which they were ingeniously incorporated into the walls here. What you see is a reconstruction of the original that disappeared during WWII and is believed to have been destroyed.
oCatherine ParkPARK
(Екатерининский парк MAP GOOGLE MAP ; May-Sep R120, Oct-Apr free; h9am-6pm)
Around the Catherine Palace extends the lovely Catherine Park. The main entrance is on Sadovaya ul, next to the Palace Chapel ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ). The park extends around the ornamental Great Pond and contains an array of interesting buildings, follies and pavilions.
Near the Catherine Palace, the Cameron Gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h11am-6pm) normally has rotating exhibitions. Between the gallery and the palace, notice the south-pointing ramp that Cameron added for the ageing empress to walk down into the park.
The park’s outer section focuses on the Great Pond ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ). In summer you can take a ferry to the little island to visit the Chesme Column ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R250/150; h11am-6pm May-Sep). Beside the pond, the blue baroque Grotto Pavilion ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h10am-5pm Fri-Wed) houses temporary exhibitions in summer. A walk around the Great Pond will reveal other buildings that the royals built over the years, including the very incongruous-looking Turkish Bath ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; R200; h11am-6pm Thu-Tue Jun-Sep), with its minaret-style tower, the wonderful Marble Bridge, the Chinese Pavilion ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), and a Concert Hall ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; tickets R500) isolated on an island, where concerts take place every Saturday at 5pm.
oAlexander PalacePALACE
(Александровский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovaya ul 2)
The classical Alexander Palace, built by Quarenghi between 1792 and 1796 for the future Alexander I, is surrounded by the charming Alexander Park. Nicholas II, the last Russian tsar, was its main tenant and he made it his residence for much of his reign.
The palace is currently undergoing renovation and is closed to the public, with completion due in 2018 at the earliest.
THE MYSTERY OF THE AMBER ROOM

The original Amber Room was created from exquisitely engraved amber panels given to Peter the Great by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia in 1716. Rastrelli later combined the panels with gilded woodcarvings, mirrors, agate and jasper mosaics to decorate one of the rooms of the Catherine Palace. Plundered by the Nazis during WWII, the room’s decorative panels were last exhibited in Königsberg’s castle in 1941. Four years later, with the castle in ruins, the Amber Room was presumed destroyed. Or was it?
In 2004, as Putin and then German Chancellor Gerhardt Schröder presided over the opening of the new US$18 million Amber Room, restored largely with German funds, rumours about the original panels continued to swirl. There are those who believe that parts, if not all, of the original Amber Room remain hidden away (see www.amberroom.org). The mystery gained traction in February 2008 as attention focused on the possible contents of an artificial cavern discovered near the village of Deutschneudorf on Germany’s border with the Czech Republic. Nothing conclusive has yet been unearthed here, though, so the mystery continues.

8Getting There & Away
From Moskovskaya metro station, take the exit marked ‘Buses for the airport’, and then pick up marshrutka 286, 299, 342 or K545 towards Pushkin (R40). These buses all continue to Pavlovsk (R50). Look for Пушкин or Дворец on the buses.
Suburban trains run from Vitebsk Station (Vitebsky vokzal) in St Petersburg, but they’re infrequent except for weekends. For Pushkin, get off at Detskoe Selo (Детское село, R47, 30 minutes) and for Pavlovsk (R54, 40 minutes) at Pavlovsk Station (Павловск). From Detskoe Selo station, marshrutky (R25) frequently run the 500m or so to Tsarskoe Selo.
Pavlovsk Павловск
%812 / POP 16,200
Less visited than better known Pushkin to the east, Pavlovsk is nevertheless home to a stunning 18th-century royal palace and one of the finest green spaces in greater St Petersburg. It's well worth tacking on a visit here to explore the artfully designed interiors – and a small but first-rate collection of old-world masterpieces – followed by a stroll amid the verdure of Pavlovsk park.
Between 1781 and 1786, on orders from Catherine the Great, architect Charles Cameron designed the Great Palace in Pavlovsk. The palace was designated for Catherine’s son Paul (hence the name, Pavlovsk), and it was his second wife, Maria Fyodorovna, who orchestrated the design of the interiors. It served as a royal residence until 1917. Ironically, the original palace burnt down two weeks after WWII when a careless Soviet soldier’s cigarette set off German mines (the Soviets blamed the Germans). As at Tsarskoe Selo, its restoration is remarkable.

One of the most tragic and mysterious characters in the Romanov royal family, emperor Paul I was intensely disliked by his own courtiers, who eventually strangled him with a scarf. Whatever historians say about him, however, he had great taste, as displayed in this glorious palace, the finest rooms of which are on the middle floor of the central block.
Charles Cameron designed the round Italian Hall beneath the dome and the Grecian Hall to its west, though the lovely green fluted columns were added by his assistant Vincenzo Brenna. Flanking these are two private suites designed mainly by Brenna – Paul’s along the north side of the block and Maria Fyodorovna’s on the south.
The Hall of War of the military-obsessed Paul contrasts with Maria’s Hall of Peace, decorated with musical instruments and flowers. On the middle floor of the south block are Paul’s Throne Room and the Hall of the Maltese Knights of St John, of whom he was the Grand Master.
Pavlovsk ParkPARK
(Павловский парк GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R150/100; h6am-9pm Sat-Thu, closed 1st Mon of month)
You'll have to pay to enter the serene Pavlovsk Great Park just to access the palace, so it’s worth exploring while you're here. Filled with rivers and ponds, tree-lined avenues, classical statues and hidden temples, it’s a delightful place to get lost in. Highlights include the Rose Pavilion (Розовый павильон GOOGLE MAP ; Pavlovsk Park; adult/student R300/150; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun) and the Private Garden (Собственный садик GOOGLE MAP ; Pavlovsk Park; adult/child R250/150; h11am-7pm), with its beautifully arranged flowerbeds and impressive sculpture of the Three Graces.

Trains and marshrutky running from St Petersburg to Pushkin continue to Pavlovsk. Marshrutky (R30) frequently shuttle between Pushkin and Pavlovsk; catch one from Pavolovskoe sh ( GOOGLE MAP ) near the southeast corner of Catherine Park, and get off either at Pavlovsk Station Bus Stop ( GOOGLE MAP ) (for entry to the park) or in front of Pavlovsk’s palace ( GOOGLE MAP ).
Gatchina Гатчина
%81371 / POP 93,000
Far less touristy than the other country palaces close to St Petersburg, Gatchina, 45km southwest of the city, can make for a very pleasant half-day trip. Gatchina is a busy and bustling town, which just happens to also host a tsarist palace and park.
1Sights
In the nearby town there are a couple of interesting churches. The baroque Pavlovsk Cathedral (Павловский собор GOOGLE MAP ; ul Sobornaya; h9am-7pm), at the end of the pedestrianised shopping street off the central pr 25 Oktyabrya, has a grandly restored interior with a soaring central dome. A short walk west is the Pokrovsky Cathedral (Покровский собор GOOGLE MAP ; Krasnaya ul; h9am-6pm), a red-brick building with bright blue domes.
Gatchina Great PalacePALACE

Shaped in a graceful curve around a central turret, the Gatchina Great Palace certainly lives up to its name – its enormous (if surprisingly plain) facade is quite a sight to behold, overlooking a vast parade ground and backing onto the huge landscaped grounds. Built by Rinaldi between 1766 and 1781 in an early classicism style for Catherine the Great’s favourite Grigory Orlov, the palace curiously combines motifs of a medieval fortress with elements commonly seen in Russian imperial residences.
It’s hard to call it beautiful, but there’s no doubt that it’s extremely impressive. After Orlov’s death in 1783, Catherine the Great bought the palace from his heirs and gifted it to her son Paul, who redesigned the exterior between 1792 and 1798.
Inside, the 10 state rooms on the 2nd floor are impressive, including Paul I’s throne room, hung with huge tapestries, and his wife Maria Fyodorovna’s throne room, the walls of which are covered in paintings. Most impressive of all is the White Hall, a Rinaldi creation from the 1770s that was redone by Brenna in the 1790s. On the balcony is an impressive collection of sundials.
Admission covers entry to the palace and all three pavillions in the grounds.
Gatchina ParkPARK
(Гатчинский парк GOOGLE MAP ; hdawn-dusk)F
Gatchina Park is more overgrown and romantic than the other palaces’ parklands. The park has many winding paths through birch groves and across bridges to islands in the large White Lake. Look out for the frankly bizarre Birch House (Березовый домик GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R50/20; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun May-Sep), which was a present from Maria Fyodorovna to Paul I. With a rough facade made of birch logs, the interior is actually very refined, with a beautiful hardwood floor made from timber from around the world.
5Eating
There is a cafe in the Grand Palace and a couple of simple cafes in the grounds, but as the place was made for picnicking, your best bet is to bring your own lunch. If you haven’t done so, however, there are a couple of decent options spread out along pedestrianised ul Sobornaya.
Kafe PiramidaRUSSIAN$

ChasyRUSSIAN$$

Hands-down Gatchina's best eatery, Chasy is a friendly spot for grilled meats and seafood, and sushi. It's also a fine afternoon spot for a pot of tea and dessert. Look for the clock over the entrance (more timepieces lie within).
8Getting There & Away
The quickest way to get to Gatchina is by bus. Bus K18, K18A and 431 (R100, 45 minutes) run this route from outside Moskovskaya metro station and stop right by the park. Bus 100 (R100, one hour) also runs regularly from Moskovskaya; buses wait outside the massive House of Soviets and stop just short of Gatchina Park. Tell the driver you want to go to the palace (‘v dvaryéts’) – the bus turns off before you get to the park.
There are trains to Gatchina Baltiysky (R102, one hour) from St Petersburg's Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) every one to two hours. The train station is directly in front of the palace.
Kronshtadt Кронштадт
%812 / POP 43,000
With its grand cathedral, waterfront parks and pretty canal-lined avenues, Kronshtadt makes for a fascinating half-day visit. Aside from taking in one grand neo-Byzantine church and visiting a little-visited corner of greater St Petersburg, this is a fine place for seeing Russia’s mighty naval centre, and getting an overview of the bay on a boat tour.
Within a year of founding St Petersburg, Peter – desirous of protecting his new Baltic toehold – started work on the fortress of Kronshtadt on Kotlin Island, 29km out in the Gulf of Finland. It’s been a pivotal Soviet and Russian naval base ever since, and was closed to foreigners until 1996.
In 1921 the hungry and poor Red Army sailors stationed here organised an ill-fated mutiny against the Bolsheviks. They set up a Provisional Revolutionary Committee and drafted a resolution demanding, among other things, an end to Lenin’s harsh War Communism. On 16 March 1921 the mutineers were defeated when 50,000 troops crossed the ice from Petrograd and massacred nearly the entire naval force. The sailors’ stand wasn’t entirely in vain, as afterwards Lenin did scrap War Communism.
1Sights & Activities
Naval CathedralCHURCH
(Морской собор GOOGLE MAP ; Yakornaya pl; h9am-6.30pm)
Kronshtadt’s key sight is the unusual and beautiful Naval Cathedral. Built between 1903 and 1913 to honour Russian naval muscle, this neo-Byzantine wonder stands on Yakornaya pl (Anchor Sq), where you’ll also find an eternal flame for Kronshtadt’s sailors, and the florid art nouveau monument of Admiral Makarov.
The cathedral underwent a thorough renovation for its centennial celebrations and is now looking breathtaking, both inside and out. Its 75m-high cupola is the highest point in town, and its enormous interior makes its use as a cinema during the Soviet period rather logical.

One of Kronshtadt's better restaurants, the 'Big Turtle' serves up salads, spaghetti with seafood, perch fillet with vegetables, and grilled meats. With decent beers on tap, it's also a fine spot for an afternoon drink. It's located a short stroll from the Naval Cathedral – cross the main bridge and continue up Roshalya, where you'll see it on the right.
8Getting There & Away
Catch bus 101 to Kronshtadt from Staraya Derevnya metro station (R40, 40 minutes). Upon exiting the metro, turn hard left and then walk past the marshrutky and trams until you come to a second bus park where the 101 bus begins and ends its route. Alternatively take marshrutka 405 from Chyornaya Rechka station (R80, 40 minutes); exit the station to your left and cross the street to find the stop.
Vehicles heading back to St Petersburg depart from both sides of the large ‘Dom Byta’ on the corner of ul Grazhdanskaya and pr Lenina. From there it’s about a 1km walk southeast to the Naval Cathedral.
With the completion of St Petersburg's ring road, it's now possible to reach Kronshtadt from Oranienbaum, meaning it's perfectly feasible to combine a trip here with a visit to one of the Tsarist palaces.

REPINO РЕПИНО

Come summer, Petersburgers stream out of the city to relax on the beaches to the north between Sestroretsk and Zelenogorsk on the Gulf of Finland. Between these two towns you’ll find the village of Repino, 45km from St Petersburg. From 1918 to the end of WWII, this area was part of Finland and the village was known as Kuokkala. In 1948, back in Russian hands, the village was renamed in honour of its most famous resident, Ilya Repin.
Penaty (Пенаты GOOGLE MAP ; %812-432 0828; www.nimrah.ru; Primorskoe Shosse 411; adult/student R300/200; hmuseum 10.30am-6pm Wed-Sun, grounds 10.30am-8pm Wed-Mon), the artist's home in his later years, is preserved as a museum. Repin bought land here in 1899, named the estate after a Roman household god and designed the light-flooded house in an arts-and-crafts style. Several of Repin's paintings still hang on the walls and the furnishings have been left just as they were during his residence, which was up to his death in 1930. His grave, marked by a simple Russian Orthodox wooden cross, is in the surrounding park, along with a couple of wooden follies also designed by Repin.
While here also visit the nearby Beach Laskovy (Пляж Ласковый GOOGLE MAP ) and stop for a meal at either Skazka ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-432 1251; www.skazkarepino.ru; Primorskoe Shosse 415; mains R570-1490; h11am-11pm; W), which has an attractive dining room with big picture windows and a terrace – both fine spots for enjoying its nicely executed dishes– or Penaty (Пенаты GOOGLE MAP ; %812-432 1125; Primorskoe Shosse 411A; mains R400-850; h10am-10pm), which serves a good range of Russian dishes and offers a pleasant flower-trimmed terrace.
The easiest way to get to Repino is to take the frequent marshrutky 400 (R105, one hour) that leave from near Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal) – cross ul Komsomola, and look for the stop on the right side of pl Lenina. You can also catch bus 211 (R90, one hour) from beside Chyornya Rechka metro station. Be sure to tell the driver that you want to get out at Penaty.
Leningrad Region Ленинградская область
If you have more time, there are several other places in the Leningrad region that can be seen in a day trip or longer from St Petersburg. These including the charming old Finnish town of Vyborg, the sleepy village of Staraya Ladoga and the monastery town of Tikhvin.
Vyborg
%81378 / POP 78,500 / TIME MOSCOW
This appealing Gulf of Finland provincial town is dominated by a medieval castle and peppered with beautiful Finnish art-nouveau buildings and romantic cobblestone streets. An important port and rail junction, Vyborg is 174km northwest of St Petersburg and just 30km from the Finnish border. It has just about enough to do to justify staying over, but is also an easy day trip from St Petersburg.
The border has jumped back and forth around Vyborg for most of its history. Peter the Great captured it from the Swedes in 1710. A century later it fell within autonomous Finland, and after the revolution Vyborg remained part of independent Finland. Since then the Finns have called it Viipuri. Stalin took Vyborg in 1939, lost it to the Finns during WWII, and on getting it back at the end of the war deported all the Finns. Today the Finns are back by the coachloads for sightseeing and carousing on the weekends.
1Sights
With the exception of Park Monrepo, all Vyborg’s main sights are neatly arranged around a compact peninsula, making it an ideal town to explore on foot.
Apart from the castle, other relics of Vyborg’s Swedish times are found in the squat Round Tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Rynochnaya), which now houses a restaurant; the remains of the 15th-century Town Hall (Башня Ратуши MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Vyborgskaya 15), with its distinctive white tower crowned with what resembles a giant metallic wizard’s hat; and the Clock Tower (Часовая башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Krepostnaya 5), dating to 1490.

Rising stoutly from an islet in Vyborg Bay, this castle was built by the Swedes in 1293 when they first captured Karelia from Novgorod. Most of it now consists of 16th-century alterations. The castle contains several exhibition halls, including a mildly diverting small museum ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; R100; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun) on local history, but the main attraction is climbing the many steps of whitewashed St Olaf’s Tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) for commanding views over the town (closed for renovations at time of research).
oHermitage VyborgMUSEUM
(Эрмитаж Выборг MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Ladanova 1; adult/student R250/150; h10am-6pm)
Housed in a wing of a striking building designed by Finnish architect Uno Ulberg in 1930, this small museum hosts themed exhibitions that are curated from the Hermitage’s massive collection and change every six months. The functional white building, which sits in the middle of an old defensive bastion, is shared with Vyborg’s arts school, which also has a gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Ladanova 1; h10am-6pm Mon-Fri) with regularly changing exhibitions.
Alvar Aalto LibraryARCHITECTURE

A must-see for architecture fans is the beautifully designed public library, one of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto's iconic designs. After years of restoration, the 1935 building looks lovelier than ever, with painstaking efforts to return it to Aalto's original vision. Handmade bronze-handled doors, circular skylights in the reading room, and elegant birchwood shelves are among the many features. It's still a working public library, open to all (though oddly, it lacks wi-fi).
Call to book a guided tour in English.
Park MonrepoPARK
(Парк Монрепо GOOGLE MAP ; www.parkmonrepos.org; adult/child R200/free; h10am-9pm May-Sep, to 6pm Oct-Apr)
This 180-hectare park facing onto tranquil Zashchitnaya Bay is a lovely place to escape the world for a few hours, if not most of the day.

Anninskie FortificationsFORTRESS
(Аннинские укрепления MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Petrovskaya ul)
At the southern end of Tverdysh Island is this double line of fortifications, built between 1730 and 1750 as protection against the Swedes and named after Empress Anna Ioanovna. Nearby, on a hill just above the restaurant Russky Dvor, a handsome statue of Peter the Great, erected on the bicentenary of the city’s capture by Russia, surveys the town.
Lenin & Esplanade ParksPARK
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Explore these two central and adjacent leafy parks, separated by Leningradsky pr, to find intriguing statutes and carved trees. At the southern end of Lenin Park is the Alvar Aalto Library, designed by the famous Finnish architect in 1935 and, in the Esplanade Park, the Lutheran SS Peter & Paul Cathedral (Собор святых апостолов Петра и Павла).
2Activities
Boat StandBOATING
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab 40-letiya Komsomola; boat hire per hr R250-300; h10am-10pm May-Sep)
In the warmer months, the best place to be is out on the water, boating peacefully, with the backdrop of old Vyborg ever at your side. A handy boat stand near the centre of town hires out row boats and paddle boats and can get you out on the water in a hurry.
1Festival & Events
In July, the town hosts the ambitious five-day Vyborg Intelligent Performance (www.vkontakte.ru/vbgpromenade) arts festival, which includes live music, theatre and lectures.
4Sleeping
Vyborg has plenty of accommodation, but the town can get busy on weekends with boatloads of visiting Finns, so book ahead if you plan to visit then. Rates at most places usually include breakfast.
Vyborg HostelHOSTEL$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-921-950 0201; www.vyborghostel.ru; ul Vyborgskaya 4; dm R600-700, r R1500; W)
Vyborg's hostel has bright, clean and well-maintained rooms that are rather lacking in charm. There's plenty of space, lots of bathrooms, a communal kitchen and bikes for hire, and the location couldn't be better.

ChampionPUB FOOD$
(Чемпион MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pr Lenina 10; mains R380-790; h11am-2am; W)
This modern pub is full of sporting paraphernalia and has plenty of TVs screening sports and music videos. It's a good place for a cooling pint of Paulaner and a globe-trotting mix of international dishes (pastas, burgers, fried squid), for a meal or snack.
oRussky DvorRUSSIAN$$
(Русский Двор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %81378-26 369; ul Shturma; meals R400-720; hnoon-midnight)
The terrace overlooking the castle and town is an ideal spot to enjoy some traditional Russian dishes like venison with berry sauce. The chef cures his own salmon and you can drink their delicious homemade honey and horseradish kvas (fermented rye-bread water). The high-ceilinged castle-like interior is also impressive, though sometimes ruined by blaring Russian pop music.
VkusEUROPEAN$$
(Вкус MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %81378-52 823; nab 40-letiya Komsomola; mains R430-1395; hnoon-midnight)
On the top floor of the Victoria Hotel, Vkus serves up Italian fare like risotto, lasagna and caprese salad, as well as spicy rack of lamb and other filling plates. With wonderful views from the small outdoor deck, Vkus is a fine spot for a drink – though the coffee isn't up to par.
Round Tower RestaurantRUSSIAN$$
(Круглая башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rynochnaya pl 1; mains R420-850; hnoon-midnight, to 2am Fri & Sat)
On the top floor of a 16th-century tower, this atmospheric and long-running place is a reliable option for traditional Russian cuisine, although it can sometimes be booked out by tour groups.
Kafe KrendelCAFE
(Кофейня Крендель MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Severny Val 3; h9.30am-8.30pm)
Near the Old Town Hall, Kafe Krendel is a charming little spot for coffee, pastries, quiche and desserts – including an excellent house-made carrot cake. In the summer, the tables on the square are a fine place to enjoy the relaxed vibe of Vyborg.
Central MarketMARKET$$
(Центральный рынок MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rynochnaya pl; h8am-6pm)

The bus and train stations are opposite each other on Vokzalnaya pl.
BOAT
ASaimaa Travel (www.saimaatravel.fi) arranges visa-free cruises (one/two days from €63/118 per person) from Lappeenranta in Finland to Vyborg.
BUS
Services to/from St Petersburg (R280, to/from either metro stations Devyatkino or Parnas) run every 20 minutes from 6.30am to 8pm. Theoretically, travel time is around 2¼ hours, but the traffic can lengthen this, so the train remains the best option.
TRAIN
Elektrichki (R301, 2½ hours, hourly) leave from St Petersburg’s Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal). Of these, there are also a handful of express services (R331, 1¼ hours, four daily), or the far more expensive Helsinki-bound trains, which stop in Vyborg (R2236, one hour).
Staraya Ladoga
%81363 / POP 3200 / TIME MOSCOW
Although you’d hardly guess it now, this tranquil village, 125km east of St Petersburg on the winding banks of the Volkhov River, lays claim to being Russia’s first capital. The idea of this place being a 'capital' of anywhere is quite extraordinary, though, and today you’ll find an ancient fortress, several churches and some prettily painted wooden cottages. It makes for a pleasant escape from St Petersburg, particularly in summer, when a swim in the river adds to the charm.
The town was known simply as Ladoga until 1704, when Peter the Great founded Novaya (New) Ladoga to the north as a transfer point for the materials arriving to build St Petersburg. Protected as a national reserve, the town’s basic layout has remained virtually unchanged since the 12th century, give or take a few ugly Soviet blocks.
RUSSIA’S ANCIENT CAPITAL

Just as the origins of Rus are continually debated, so is Staraya Ladoga’s status as ‘Russia’s first capital’. Nevertheless, its age (historians have given 753 as the village’s birth date) and significance remain uncontested.
When the Scandinavian Viking Rurik, along with his relatives Truvor and Sineus, swept into ancient Russia in 862, he built a wooden fortress on the Volkhov River and made this his base. Rurik is depicted in a colourful mosaic on the side of the village school. Locals also claim that one of the tumuli (Урочище Сопки) at the north end of the village is the grave of Oleg, Rurik’s successor.
Archaeological expeditions continue to uncover a wealth of information about the town’s past. In 1997 a second 9th-century fortress was discovered 2km outside the village. Evidence of Byzantine influences in the frescoes of the village’s 12th-century churches point to the town as a cultural as well as historical and commercial crossroads.
1Sights
Everything of interest lies along the main road that runs parallel to the river.
Staraya Ladoga FortressHISTORIC SITE
(Староладожская крепость GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R150/free; h9am-5pm Mon-Fri, to 6pm Sat & Sun)
Towards the southern end of the village, and with an excellent view along the river, the 7m-thick walls and stout towers of this fortress are slowly being rebuilt. Inside the grounds you’ll find the small stone St George’s Church (Георгиевская Церковь GOOGLE MAP ; 9am-6pm; hMay-Oct), only open May to October in order to protect the remains of the delicate 12th-century frescoes still visible on its walls, and the cute wooden Church of Dimitry Solun.
The Vorotnaya Tower houses the good Historical-Architectural & Archaeological Museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; h9am-5pm Mon-Fri, to 6pm Sat & Sun), which displays an interesting retrospective of the area’s history, including a scale model of how the fortress once looked and items found on archaeological digs, with English explanations.
Visiting this soulful old place and wandering around its crumbling ramparts is a unique experience and you might feel you're in a Tarkovsky film.
Svyato-Uspensky Devichy MonasteryMONASTERY
(Свято-Успенский девичий монастырь GOOGLE MAP ; Volkhovsky pr; h9am-6pm)
The women's monastery on the main road in Staraya Ladoga is a remarkably atmospheric place to wander. The small brick church, with its 900-year-old frescoes, is only open on weekends during summer; at other times you can visit the grounds.
Nikolsky MonasteryMONASTERY
(Никольский монастырь GOOGLE MAP ; www.en.nikmonas.ru; h9am-6pm)
This attractive walled complex dates to the 12th century and is still in the process of being rebuilt following its decommissioning during the Soviet years. The main church and bell tower now look quite handsome. Nearby is a pontoon from which you can swim in the river.
The monastery is located about 1km south of Staraya Ladoga Fortress.

Staraya Ladoga HotelHOTEL$
(Отель Старая Ладога GOOGLE MAP ; %931-531 9043; ul Sovetskaya 6; s/d with shared bathroom R1700/2200; W)
The best overnight option in Staraya Ladoga is this modest grey-brick hotel, tucked down a lane north of the Svyato-Uspensky Devichy Monastery. Although it looks unpromising from the outside, the rooms are fairly well maintained with sizeable windows overlooking the surrounding greenery.
Mini-Hotel LadyaBOUTIQUE HOTEL$
(Гостиница Ладья GOOGLE MAP ; %81363-49 555; Sovetskaya 3; r R2000-2500; W)
While not looking promising from the outside, this five-room hotel, which shares the premises of the local clinic, has pleasant, contemporary-styled rooms and even a sauna. Only tea and coffee are served, so you’ll have to make your own breakfast arrangements.
Knyaz RurikRUSSIAN$$
(Князь Рюрик GOOGLE MAP ; ul Kultury 7; mains R285-520; h10am-9pm Sun-Thu, to 11pm Fri & Sat)
Rurik’s family tree is painted across the brick wall of this small, nicely designed restaurant, which displays ye olde local shields as decoration. Portions of mushroom soup, bliny, salad and shashlyk are small but tasty.
8Getting There & Away
Elektrichki to Volkhov (the Volkhovstroy I station) depart from both St Petersburg’s Moskovsky and Ladozhsky stations (R300, 2½ hours, 20 daily). From Volkhov, bus 23 (R48, 30 minutes, hourly) departs from the main bus stop outside the station towards Novaya Ladoga, passing through Staraya Ladoga. Get off when you see the fortress. A taxi from Volkhov costs R320.
Buses to and from Tikhvin also pass near the Yuzhkovo turn-off to the village, so you can combine a visit to both destinations. When you get off at Yuzhkovo, take a taxi (there are usually a couple hanging around to meet buses) to Staraya Ladoga (R250). It's also just as easy to take a train from Tikhvin to Volkhov.
Tikhvin Тихвин
%81367 / POP 57,900 / TIME MOSCOW
The highlight of this small, quiet town on the banks of the Tikhvinka River is a beautiful monastery established in 1560 by decree of Ivan the Terrible. There’s been a community here since the 14th century, and for thousands of years before that the area formed part of the hereditary lands of the Finnic Veps (also known as Vepsians). Tikhvin is also the birthplace of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, whose music was inspired by the local nature, folk tunes and religious ringing of bells.

Tikhvin Monastery of the Mother of GodMONASTERY
(Тихвинский Богородичный Успенский Мужской Монастырь GOOGLE MAP ; www.tihvinskii-monastyr.ru; ul Tikhvinskaya 1; h8am-8pm)
Rising like a fairy tale across the Tabory pond, this complex is about a 1km walk from the train station straight along Sovetskaya ul. At its heart is the onion-domed Assumption Cathedral, established in 1510, and painted inside, and partially outside, with detailed frescoes. A famous icon of Mary and Jesus said to have been painted by the apostle Luke draws awed pilgrims from across Russia, particularly on 9 July, when a procession celebrates the return of the icon to Tikhvin.
The complex’s nunnery, crowned by a five-spired belfry, is where Ivan the Terrible sent his fourth wife to be confined. Within the walls you’ll also find several museums, including the Tikhvin Historical Memorial & Architectural Museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; ul Tikhvinskaya 1; adult/child R120/free; h9am-5pm Tue-Sun), which has interesting displays on the monastery’s history and examples of its religious art dating back to the 16th century.

(Государственный Дом-музей Римского-Корсакова GOOGLE MAP ; %81369-51 509; ul Rimskogo-Korsakova 12; adult/child R110/free; h10am-5pm Tue-Sun)
This early-19th-century wooden house was the composer’s childhood home until the age of 12. It became a museum in 1944, the centenary of Rimsky-Korsakov’s birth, and the rooms have been reconstructed to look as they would have done when his family was living there. The charming guides will point out all the original features, including a Becker grand piano on which concerts are sometimes given (call for details).
There’s a stone bust of the composer on a plinth in the small park next to the house. Opposite is the tiny Church of All Saints Polkovaya (Церковь Всех Святых “Полковая”), which also sometimes hosts concerts.

IstoriyaRUSSIAN$$
(История GOOGLE MAP ; ul Sovetskaya 62; Mains R460-840; hnoon-midnight)
Restaurant 'History' boasts country charm on the inside, with heavy wooden tables and chairs and old photos of Tikhvin on the walls. The cooking is decent, with Russian classics like pelmeni and borscht, plus grilled fish and pastas made in-house.
It's located just before the turnoff to the monastery.
8Getting There & Away
The town is on the rail route to Vologda and Arkhangelsk, so you could break your journey to or from either of those destinations here.
Tikhvin’s bus and train stations are opposite each other on Vokzalny per. Trains here leave from St Petersburg’s Ladozhsky vokzal (platskart/kupe R670/1150, three to four hours, six daily). Bus 860 goes four times a day from St Petersburg's bus station to Tikhvin (R400, 4½ hours). The last departure from Tikhvin back to St Petersburg is around 5pm.
To travel to Staraya Ladoga, there is no direct service. By train you can travel from Tikhvin to Volkhov (1½ to two hours, from R550, eight daily), and hop on an onward bus (R48, 30 minutes) or taxi (R330) into town.

White Nights
1In mid-June the sun slumps lazily towards the horizon, but never fully sets, meaning that the magical nights are a wonderful whitish-grey. At this time Petersburgers indulge themselves in plenty of all-night revelry, several arts festivals take place including the spectacular Scarlet Sails (Алые паруса GOOGLE MAP ; http://parusaspb.ru; hJun). Though it’s the busiest time to visit the city, and most hotels are booked up weeks in advance, there’s nothing quite like it, so don’t miss out – even if you come in May or July you’ll be impressed by how late the sun stays out!

The Hermitage
2Perhaps the world’s greatest museum, this iconic establishment’s vast collection is quite simply mind-boggling, with Egyptian mummies, more Rembrandts than the Louvre, and a collection of early-20th-century art that is unrivalled by almost any other in the world. As if this wasn’t enough, your entry ticket allows you to walk around the fascinating apartments and dazzling staterooms of the Romanovs. On top of this, there are still other Hermitage sites: the Winter Palace of Peter I, General Staff Building, Menshikov Palace, Imperial Porcelain factory and the excellent Hermitage Storage Facility.

St Isaac’s View
3No other viewpoint of the historic centre beats the one from the rotunda surrounding the stunning gold dome of St Isaac’s Cathedral, which rises majestically over the uniformly sized Italianate palaces and mansions around the Admiralty. Well worth the climb up the 262 steps, a panorama of the city opens up to you – with fantastic views over the river, the Winter Palace and the Bronze Horseman. The cathedral’s interior is also well worth seeing, with a wonderfully over-the-top iconostasis framed by columns of marble, malachite and lazurite.

Russian Museum
4Even though the Hermitage is unrivalled as St Petersburg’s most impressive museum, that shouldn’t stop you from visiting this superb treasure trove of Russian art, spread out over four stunning palaces in the centre of the city. The main building, the Mikhailovsky Palace, presents a fascinating collection of Russian art from medieval icons to 20th-century avant-garde masterpieces, while the Marble Palace houses a wing of the Ludwig Museum with a focus on contemporary works, and the Stroganov Palace has some of the most spectacular interiors in the city.

Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood
5As much a symbol of the city as the Winter Palace, the spellbinding Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood never fails to impress. The church was built to commemorate the death of Tsar Alexander II, who, in an event that gave the church its unusual name, was attacked here by a terrorist group and later died of his injuries in 1881. Despite its grisly heritage, the glittering, multicoloured onion domes, and intricate interior and exterior mosaics are quite simply stunning, and have to be seen to be believed.

Tsarskoe Selo
6Arguably the most beautiful of the tsarist palace areas that surround St Petersburg, Tsarskoe Selo can be an idyllic place for a day trip. Arrive in good time to see the lavish interiors of the Catherine Palace, including the famous Amber Room, enjoy the gorgeous formal gardens and have a picnic in the landscaped park where Catherine the Great so loved to walk. When it gets impossibly busy at the height of summer, retreat to the nearby scenic estate and palace of Pavlovsk, a beautiful place to escape the crowds.

7What could be more Russian than seeing a ballet or opera at the city’s famous Mariinsky Theatre? Formerly known as the Kirov, where Soviet stars such as Nureyev and Baryshnikov danced, the Mariinsky has one of the world's premier ballet troupes as well as a superb orchestra led by artistic director Valery Gergiev. Tickets for productions here are always sought-after, so book online before you travel to ensure you don’t miss out. Even if such performances are not your thing, the historic building is a sight in its own right.

Peter & Paul Fortress
8The city’s first major building is on little Zayachy Island. It’s immediately recognisable from its extraordinary golden spire, visible all over the city centre at an incredible (for the 18th century) 122m high. A visit to this large complex is a must for history buffs: here you'll find the tombs of the Romanovs and an excellent history museum; make time, too, for a walk along the ramparts. You can even relax on a surprisingly decent beach with stellar views across to the Strelka and Hermitage!

Cruising the Canals
9St Petersburg is a city that is best appreciated from the water. Despite Peter’s efforts, public boat transport by river and canal never quite caught on in the ‘Venice of the North’. Even so, don't miss a canal-boat tour or, better yet, paddling yourself in a kayak to see some of the city's architectural gems from a different perspective. While cruising the canals is only possible outside the winter months, if you're here when they're frozen over don't miss wandering along their banks for a visual treat.

Taking a Banya
10For a real cultural immersion, head to one of St Petersburg's bani (steam baths), such as the classy Degtyarniye Baths, for the detox of a lifetime. In between basking in the infernal wet heat of the parilka (steam room), having your toxins removed through a sound birch-twig whipping and then plunging into ice-cold water, this is a great place to relax and chat with locals for whom the weekly banya (steam bath) is considered to be almost a sacred rite.





Arriving in St Petersburg
Pulkovo Airport From St Petersburg's superb airport, an official taxi to the centre should cost between R800 and R1000; if you book one via an app it's likely to be R700. Alternatively, take bus 39 (35 minutes) or 39A (20 minutes) to Moskovskaya metro station for R35, then take the metro from Moskovskaya (Line 2) all over the city for R45.
Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal) Easy connection to the nearby pl Vosstaniya (Line 1) and Mayakovskaya (Line 3) metro stations.



Travel at Night
Public transport in St Petersburg shuts down some time after midnight, meaning that taxis and walking are your only options for getting around. There's also the issue of some bridges over the Neva River rising nightly between April and November. This means that if you want to cross the river late at night you need to plan accordingly. Now that there is the Western High Speed Diameter highway it's always possible to get from one side of the Neva to the other, although it will involve a possibly long taxi ride across this toll road.

MAfter a hearty breakfast, head to the Hermitage and get ready for a day of artistic exhilaration. Choose which parts of the collection you want to see, though leave some room for on-the-spot decision making – the exhibition is so enormous that you’ll inevitably discover something new. As well as the art, don’t miss the staterooms, and allow yourself plenty of rest stops to avoid exhaustion.
5Lunch Savour some excellent Russian cuisine at Yat.

NIf you’ve booked ahead, dress up to spend the evening watching a ballet from the classical repertoire of the Mariinsky Theatre. Even if you haven’t booked, it’s usually quite possible to do so last minute in one of the other theatres in town. For a late-night drink with live jazz drop by Hat.

Day Three
Petrograd & Vyborg Sides

MThis is your chance to explore the beautiful Petrograd Side.

5Lunch Enjoy great views over the Neva at Koryushka.

Vasilyevsky Island

RAfter lunch, walk across to Vasilyevsky Island, and wander the historic ensemble around the Strelka.

If you enjoy contemporary art, continue on to the excellent Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art.
5Dinner Dine in understated Russian elegance at Restoran.

Smolny & Vosstaniya

NHead south to happening Vosstaniya to gallery-, bar- and gig-hop around Ligovsky pr. See some new artwork at Loft Project ETAGI and, if it's summer, enjoy a drink in the sand and some table football at Dyuni.

Day Four
Around St Petersburg

MHead out of the city early to spend the day in tsarist opulence. Go first to Tsarskoe Selo in order to visit the Catherine Palace and have a walk in the gardens. If you’re still wanting more, head for Pavlovsk, a quick bus ride away, where the park is even wilder and more beautiful.
5Lunch Eat at White Rabbit in the town of Pushkin.

Historic Heart

RReturn to the city in the afternoon and slot in the Russian Museum, the perfect complement to the Hermitage. This spectacular (and far more manageable) museum showcases seven centuries of Russian art from church icons to the avant-garde.
5Dinner Settle in for a wonderful set meal at EM restaurant.

Smolny & Vosstaniya

NBar hop from ul Rubinshteyna north along the Fontanka, sneaking into the secret bar Commode, followed by Union and Terminal Bar. Catch a live band at Fish Fabrique, Cosmonaut or alternative favourite Griboyedov for a taste of what's cooking on the local music scene.




Walking Tours
There is no shortage of walking tours in St Petersburg, the chief advantage of which is getting a local's perspective on the city. Even though distances are long, walking is a great way to discover courtyards, gardens, quirky sights and side streets that you might otherwise miss. Some operators will provide transport for walking tours as well, meaning that greater areas can be covered. Some highly recommended operators include:
Peterswalk Walking Tours (%812-943 1229; http://peterswalk.com; from R1320) Going for over 20 years, Peter Kozyrev’s innovative and passionately led tours are highly recommended as a way to see the city with knowledgeable locals. The daily Original Peterswalk is one of the favourites and leaves daily from the Julia Child Bistro at 10.30am from April to end of September. The choice of tours available is enormous and includes a Rasputin Walk and a WWII and the Siege of Leningrad tour.
Sputnik Tours (%499-110 5266; www.sputnik8.com; price varies) This online tour agency is one with a difference: it acts as a marketplace for locals wanting to give their own unique tours of their city. Browse, select a tour, register and pay a deposit and then you get given the contact number of the guide. A superb way to meet locals you'd never meet otherwise.
Placemates (%925 845 3747; http://placemates.ru; prices vary) This online portal connects visitors with locals running a variety of tours and interesting experiences around the city, including access to rooftops such as that of the Singer Building, a visit to a glassmaking factory or to a weaver's. They sometimes run free walking tours starting from Admiralteyskaya metro station.
St Petersburg Free Tour (http://petersburgfreetour.com) The central offering of this tour company is its 10.45am daily free city tour, which departs from the Alexander Column on Palace Square. But the company has plenty of other (not free but still reasonably priced) tours on offer, including metro tours, communist Leningrad and the Hermitage.
VB Excursions (%812-380 4596; www.vb-excursions.com) Offers excellent walking tours with clued-up students on themes including Dostoevsky and Revolutionary St Petersburg. Their ‘Back in the USSR’ tour (R3850 per person) includes a visit to a typical Soviet apartment for tea and bliny.




Outdoor Activities
As the seasons change so do the types of outdoor activities that are on offer. Winter sees Yelagin Island morph into a top location for ice-skating and cross-country skiing. The same location and Krestovsky Island are both good spots to hire bicycles or go in-line skating. For downhill skiing (nothing too challenging as the terrain is fairly flat) there are small ski resorts in a radius of 10km to 20km around the city, including Ohta Park (www.ohtapark.ru), Krasnoe Ozero ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-960 0960; www.krasnoeozero.ru; Korobitsyno) and Tuutari Park ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-380 5062; www.tyytari.spb.ru; Retselya 14; h5-10pm Mon-Fri, 10am-9pm Sat & Sun Dec-Mar).
Warmer weather brings the opportunity for kayaking around the city's canals and rivers. Contact Wild Russia to go further afield to Lake Ladoga for yachting and kayaking, as well as off-road biking, parachuting, quad biking and rock climbing outside the city. You can also charter yachts and motorboats via the agency Solnechny Parus ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-327 3525; www.solpar.ru; 2nd fl, Ligovsky pr 94A; mLigovsky Prospekt).
Or you could hit the beach – there's a city-centre one facing the Neva beside the walls of the Peter & Paul Fortress (this is where people famously sunbathe standing up against the stone walls), or head out of town to lovely Beach Laskovy at Repino.
Spectator Sports



Banya
If you’re looking for a uniquely Russian experience, then head to the nearest banya (steam bath) of which St Petersburg has several, both standard and luxury. Enter the parilka (steam room) stark naked and sit back and watch the mercury rise. To eliminate toxins and improve circulation, bathers beat each other (never too hard!) with a bundle of birch branches, known as veniki. It's actually an extremely pleasant sensation. When you can’t take the heat, retreat. A public banya allows access to a plunge pool, usually filled with ice-cold water. The contrast in temperature is invigorating, energising and purifying.
Best Banyas
Krugliye Bani One of the best spots for a traditional banya; includes a heated open air pool.
Degtyarniye Baths Central, modern and one of the most foreigner-friendly bani.
Mytninskiye Bani The oldest communal banya in the city, heated by a wood furnace.
Palace Bridge Wellness Club Offers several styles of sauna in which to steam away all your stresses.




Travelling to Moscow

Many visitors to St Petersburg combine their trip here with one to Moscow. Russia's two largest cities are superbly well connected to each other, with flights leaving at least every hour, Sapsan express trains during the day, slower overnight trains you can sleep on, and even slower boats.

Air
The following airlines fly direct from Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg to three different Moscow airports. Book in advance and you can get tickets as cheap as R2750 one-way, although normally prices are between R4000 and R7000.
Aeroflot (www.aeroflot.ru) Flies around 20 times a day to Sheremetyevo Airport.
Rossiya Airlines (www.rossiya-airlines.com) Flies to Vnukovo Airport and operates 11 flights per day between the two cities.
S7 Airlines (www.s7.ru) Operates 11 flights per day between St Petersburg and Domodedovo Airport.
UTair (www.utair.ru) Operates four daily flights between St Petersburg and Vnukovo Airport.
Ural Airlines (www.uralairlines.com) Offers two daily flights to Domodedovo Airport.
Boat
Boats from Moscow and elsewhere within Russia arrive at the River Passenger Terminal, which is a short walk away from the Proletarskaya metro station. Leaving the metro, turn right onto pr Obukhovskoy Oborony and it’s five minutes up the road.
Train
All trains to Moscow from St Petersburg depart from the Moscow Station. Take your pick from the overnight sleeper trains or the super-fast Sapsan day trains. All train tickets can be bought online at www.rzd.ru, or from the machines at any station in St Petersburg.
Overnight
There are about 10 overnight trains travelling between St Petersburg and Moscow. Most depart between 10pm and 1am, arriving in the capital the following morning between 6am and 8am. On the more comfortable firmenny trains, such as the Red Arrow (Красная стрела) or Grand Express (ГРАНД ЭКСПРЕСС) a de-luxe sleeping carriage is between R12,800 and R16,400, 1st-class compartment (two-person cabin) around R16,300, while a 2nd-class kupe (four-person cabin) is R2800. Less fancy trains offer 3rd-class platzkartny (dorm-style sleeping carriages) for R1570 and even sitting-only carriages for R890.
If in a sleeping carriage you may have to pay a small amount extra for bed linen, although with some tickets this – and breakfast – is included.
Sapsan
These high-speed trains travel at 200km/h to reach Moscow in around four hours. There are six to eight daily departures. Comfortable 2nd-class seats start at R1300, while super-spacious 1st-class seats run from R5000.






Museums & Galleries

St Petersburg is a city of museums and galleries, famed around the world for its world-class collection at the Hermitage, but also for the stellar Russian Museum and the widely renowned Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. Elsewhere, St Petersburg's smaller institutions focus on everything from the Arctic to zoology, via bread, toys, trams, trains, religion and vodka.

The Big Three
If you're only going to visit three museums, make it a triad of art galleries: the Hermitage, the Russian Museum and the Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. The Hermitage needs no introduction – suffice to say that one of the greatest art collections on the planet should always be top of your must-see list. The lesser-known Russian Museum displays Russian art from the medieval times until the early 20th century and is the perfect counterpoint to the Hermitage's Western Art collection. Finally, though it only opened in 2010, Erarta has established itself as one of world's best collections of modern and contemporary Russian art and should not be missed.
Newer Additions
While many of St Petersburg's most august museums are bastions of tradition, things are being kept fresh and exciting by several newer arrivals. Top of the list are the fabulous galleries at the General Staff Building, a major branch of the Hermitage that's home to a superb collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works by the likes of Monet, Matisse and Picasso. The dazzling Fabergé Museum, in a converted palace on the Fontanka, showcases the apex of Peter Carl Fabergé's jewellery making and features some 1500 of his unique creations including nine Imperial Easter eggs. A rather different tone is set by the exciting Street Art Museum, based on the territory of a laminated plastics factory in the suburb of Okhta. Here the brick and concrete walls act as canvases for celebrated and up-and-coming street artists from across Russia and around the world to create a different themed show each year. An old collection of boats, models and paintings has been rejuvenated by a new location for the Central Naval Museum in Kolomna. Nearby you'll find MISP, the Museum of St Petersburg Art (20th–21st centuries), with regularly changing exhibitions of modern and contemporary works by local artists.
The Best of the Rest
Other smaller and often lesser-known museums that are well worth building into your itinerary include the fascinatingly macabre Kunstkamera, Peter the Great's private cabinet of curiosities (think babies in bottles); the Russian Museum of Ethnography displaying traditional crafts and cultures from across the region; the Museum of Political History in a palace that was home to the famous ballet dancer Mathilda Kshesinskaya; and the excellent complex of museums at the Peter & Paul Fortress, the kernel of 18th-century St Petersburg and home to a good museum covering the city's history.
Art Galleries & House Museums
Some of Russia's most famous artists, including Ilya Repin and Karl Bryullov, trained at the renowned Academy of Arts and the Applied Arts School. Both these schools have galleries open to the public that are well worth checking out. An appreciation of the arts continues to be fostered in the city. You can access the best of modern and contemporary arts at places such as the Kuryokhin Centre, Pushkinskaya 10, the Novy Museum, K-Gallery and Marina Gisich Gallery.
St Petersburg is also a city of literary titans. The flat where Pushkin breathed his last after his fatal duel is preserved as a museum. So too are the former homes of the writers Gabriel Derzhavin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Vladimir Nabokov and Anna Akhmatova. Each provides some insight into the lives of these famed literary figures as well as a chance to glimpse how Russians lived in the past.
NEED TO KNOW

Opening Days & Hours

Nearly all museums close at least one day a week. This tends to vary, although Monday and Tuesday are the most common days. Be aware that in addition to this, many museums close one day a month additionally for cleaning; it’s worth checking a museum’s website for these details.
Language Issues

Things are getting better but few museums have full signage in English. Audioguides, increasingly available in English, are a great way to understand a collection. Guided tours in English vary enormously in quality and usually need to be booked in advance.
Ticket Prices

As a foreigner you will often be charged a ‘foreigner price’, anything from 50% to 100% more than the Russian price. That said, children, students and pensioners all normally receive discounts on entrance fees, even as foreigners, so it’s always worth asking.

Eating

There has never been a better time to eat out in St Petersburg. The range and quality of food available seem to increase year on year, making stereotypes about Russian food now seem like bizarre anachronisms. Petersburgers have well and truly caught the foodie bug, and while little of good quality is cheap in this town, the choice is now bigger than ever.

Getting Serious About Food
St Petersburg has become a place where good food is prized and defined not by its high price tag but rather by the talents of the chef. Fresh, local ingredients, inventive combinations, the use of herbs and spices (other than the ubiquitous dill) and a wider range of flavours are a fixture on the city’s dining tables, and while there’s still plenty of mediocre food out there, visitors today are truly spoiled for choice. We’ve never had an easier time recommending restaurants. However, good places are rarely the most obvious and it's recommend to reserve for the very best.
Modern Russian
Russian food, it’s fair to say, has an image problem – and if you’re not careful you can easily end up with dill-smothered soups, under-seasoned and over-cooked meats, and salads that are more mayonnaise than vegetable. But fret not: there is great Russian cooking to be had in St Petersburg now – both traditional and contemporary, and increasingly a combination of the two. Russian chefs have been rediscovering their own culinary history and have been slowly moving away from the dozen or so standard offerings that are ubiquitous on the country’s menus. They’re preparing rarer or even forgotten dishes, such as venison and duck cooked in subtle and interesting ways and combined with herbs and fresh, organic vegetables. Economic sanctions on food products from the EU have given a boost to local providers, with places such as Cococo and EM Restaurant making a virtue of farm-to-table dining principles.
Local Chains
St Petersburg has a number of home-grown restaurant and cafe chains that are well worth knowing about as they provide cheap and reliable eating options all over town. Chief among these is the now international pie chain Stolle (Штолле; www.stolle.ru), a near-ubiquitous cafe where delicious, moist savoury and sweet pies are available to eat in and take away. Similar and equally numerous is the chain of bakery cafes Bulochnye F. Volcheka (Булочные Ф. Вольчека; www.fvolchek.ru). A couple of other chains to look out for are coffee-and-cake specialists Bushe (Буше; www.bushe.ru) and Baltic Bread (Балтийский Хлеб; www.baltic-bread.ru), which does good sandwiches and pastries.
International Cuisine
Long gone are the days when international cuisine in St Petersburg was limited to the odd Georgian or Italian place. As Russians have travelled more and experienced more foreign cuisines, their tastes have widened and there's a healthy mixture of non-Russian cuisine available in St Petersburg today, running from Thai and Indian to American and even Lithuanian. Gourmet burgers are hugely popular and there's plenty of excellent French, German, Italian and pan-Asian food on the city's menus – especially sushi (which is rarely that great). More common, however, is the international menu, where Russian dishes, pizza, sushi and noodles all compete side-by-side for your attention. In many cases this means that all four are pretty average, but increasingly there are places that know what they’re doing with multiple cuisines.
Vegetarian Options
There is now a very respectable variety of vegetarian cuisine on offer, both at mainstream restaurants and at an increasing number of meat-free places. Look out for vegetarian chains Troitsky Most and Ukrop, as well as individual restaurants such as Botanika and Samadeva. Some non-vegetarian restaurants that offer plenty of choice for non-meat eaters include Marketplace, Zoom Café and Mamaliga. Fish is widely offered on menus, making an excellent alternative for pescatarians. During the 40 days before Orthodox Easter (veliky post in Russian), many restaurants also offer a Lent menu that is animal-free.

Like a Local
Locals still disappear to their local stolovaya (столовая; canteen) at lunchtime for a supremely cheap and social meal, albeit one that's rarely particularly exciting. These places, hangovers from the Soviet days, are usually signposted in Cyrillic and tend to be located in basements and courtyards, but if you stumble across one (look for the sign столовая), you're normally more than welcome to go in. Experiences don't come much more local than this, and you'll usually find yourself saving plenty of cash if you eat in such places. A sign of their enduring popularity is the recent reinvention of the stolovaya in such guises as Marketplace, Obed Bufet and the chain Stolovaya No 1 Kopeika (Cтоловая No. 1 Kопейка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://st1.one; Nevsky pr 25; mains R25-50, set lunch R99; h24hr; mNevsky Prospekt). These modern, attractive spaces that have taken the essential idea of a stolovaya and translated it into something appealing for the contemporary St Petersburg diner.
Eating by Neighbourhood

AHistoric Heart A scattering of gems among many mediocre places.
ASennaya & Kolomna Location of some of the city’s best restaurants.
ASmolny & Vosstaniya Cool and innovative dining options abound.
AVasilyevsky Island Reasonable selection with a good showing of Caucasus restaurants.
APetrograd & Vyborg Sides Best choices are in Petrograd Side.
NEED TO KNOW

Opening Hours

Nearly all restaurants are open seven days a week, generally from around 11am or noon until at least 11pm. Many restaurants open 'until the last customer' – a fairly nonspecific term that means as long as someone is still ordering, they’ll keep serving.
Reservations

The vast majority of restaurants don’t require reservations, though they can be handy on Friday or Saturday evening or for weekend breakfasts in popular places. Reservations are always recommended if you want to sit in a particular place, for example outside on the terrace.
Service

Service has improved; at fancy places it often veers on the over-attentive. The main problem you’ll have is that most waiting staff’s English is limited.
Tipping

In little cafes and cheap eats, tipping is not expected, though you can easily round up the amount you pay if you’re happy with the service. Anywhere more upmarket will usually expect a 10% tip and some add service to the bill.
English Menus

These are a lifeline for non-Russian speakers and are available in nearly all good restaurants, though they’re often not available in cheaper cafes (and when they are, they are very badly translated). Bring along a sense of humour and adventure!

Neighbourhoods at a Glance

1Historic Heart
Radiating out from the golden spire of the Admiralty towards the Fontanka River, the Historic Heart has plenty of obvious attractions, such as the Hermitage, Russian Museum and the Church on the Spilled Blood, not to mention the city's most famous avenue: Nevsky Prospekt. There are also quirky gems like the Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines and a quartet of lovely parks. This is where you will be spending most of your time in St Petersburg, especially as the area is also blessed with excellent hotels, dining and drinking options.

2Sennaya & Kolomna
These two areas adjoin the Historic Heart and are almost as historic themselves. Sennaya is centred on Sennaya Pl (the Haymarket), a traditionally poor area that was immortalised in Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment and has somehow retained its seedy, down-at-heel air despite a big attempt to redevelop it. Kolomna is the largest of seven islands and a quiet, rather out-of-the-way place, although one steeped in history and great beauty. It contains the world-famous Mariinsky Theatre and more canals and rivers than any other part of the city.
3Smolny & Vosstaniya
This agglomeration of four districts (Smolny, Liteyny, Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya) is also part of the city centre. The Smolny peninsula is a well-heeled residential district dominated by the Smolny Cathedral, while next-door Liteyny is centred on Liteyny pr, a commercial street between the Smolny and the Fontanka River. South of Nevsky pr are Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya. Vosstaniya is the focus of St Petersburg’s underground art and drinking scene, while Vladimirskaya, named after the stunning Vladimirsky Cathedral, is a mercantile district full of shopping, markets and a clutch of quirky museums.
4Vasilyevsky Island
The eastern edge of Vasilyevsky Island (or VO as it's usually shortened to) was originally designed to be the administrative heart of the city under Peter the Great. The plan was never carried out but there's still a concentration of historical sights there, including the Strelka and Kunstkamera. The western side of the island is more industrial, but is also home to the fantastic Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. Transport fans will be thrilled by the opportunity to tour a couple of submarines and an icebreaker, and by museums devoted to trams and the metro.
5Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
The Petrograd Side is a fascinating place that includes everything from the Peter and Paul Fortress to an impressive clutch of Style Moderne buildings lining its main drag. It also hosts a beautiful mosque, many interesting museums and huge swaths of parkland on the Kirov Islands, the city’s largest green lung. The Vyborg Side is famous for its role in Soviet history and can be a little bleak. That said, a walk around the fascinating postindustrial landscape here will appeal to travellers who have palace fatigue, and a few interesting sights make the trip worthwhile.

Explore the Historic Heart
The Historic Heart is a fast-paced, crowded area that's the commercial and tourist focus of the city. For an unforgettable first impression, head straight to vast Palace Sq: on one side is the Winter Palace, home to the main collection of the Hermitage; on the other, the sweeping grandeur of the General Staff Building, its east wing housing the Hermitage's amazing stash of Impressionist and post-Impressionist works.
From here, cherry-pick your way through the rest of the neighbourhood over a couple of days or so. You could spend one day, for example, touring the excellent Russian Museum and its branches such as the Marble Palace and Stroganov Palace. If you're speedy (and have the stamina for visual overload) then also squeeze into the same day the dazzling Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood and the splendid view from the cupola of St St Isaac's Cathedral. When you need a breather, take a break from the hubbub in the lush Summer Garden or Mikhailovsky Garden.
Nevsky pr, the city’s main avenue, dominates every itinerary, and you’ll find yourself back on its broad, busy pavements throughout your visit, popping in and out of shops such as Kupetz Eliseevs. Spend some time off the main drag, though, to find fascinating contrasts, such as the Asian-feeling outdoor market stalls of Apraksin Dvor. In the evening, find high-class entertainment in the theatres around Ploshchad Iskusstv and Ploshchad Ostrovskogo or head to the clubs and cocktails bars that are often hidden away in unexpected places.
Local Life
AParks The vast Mars Field, Summer Garden, Mikhailovsky Gardens or Alexander Garden are delightful green spaces for taking a breather from sightseeing to enjoy a picnic and do some sunbathing on sunny days.
AFree Art Locals flock to the Hermitage on the first Thursday of each month when entrance is free, although the crowds can be huge!
Getting There & Away
AMetro This neighbourhood is served by three metro stations: the interconnecting Nevsky Prospekt (Line 2) and Gostiny Dvor (Line 3), and Admiralteyskaya (Line 5) around the corner from the Hermitage.
ATrolleybus The number 7 bus, which runs the length of Nevsky pr, goes past Palace Sq and then crosses Dvortsovy most to Vasilyevsky Island.
ABus Hop on buses 7, 10, 24, 27, 181 or 191 to save some footwork along Nevsky.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
A great boon for time-challenged visitors, or those wanting to avoid daytime crowds – especially tour and school groups – has been the extension of opening hours until 9pm at least once a week at major city museums and galleries, including the Hermitage (Wednesday and Friday) and the Russian Museum (Thursday).

THE HERMITAGE
The geographic and tourism centrepiece of St Petersburg is one of the world’s greatest art collections and usually most visitors’ first stop in the city, even if it is simply to admire the baroque Winter Palace and the extraordinary ensemble of buildings that surround it. No other institution so embodies the opulence and extravagance of the Romanovs.

The Collection
The Hermitage first opened to the public in 1852. Today, for the price of admission, anybody can parade down the grand staircases and across parquet floors, gawping at crystal chandeliers, gilded furniture and an amazing art collection that once was for the Tsar's court's eyes only.
The main complex consists of five connected buildings – the Winter Palace, the Small Hermitage, the Great (Old) Hermitage (also known as the Large Hermitage), the New Hermitage and the Hermitage Theatre – and is devoted to items from prehistoric times up until the mid-19th century. Impressionist, post-Impressionist and modern works are found in the new galleries of the General Staff Building across Palace Sq.
The Western European Collection, in particular, does not miss much: Spanish, Flemish, Dutch, French, English and German art are all covered from the 15th to the 18th centuries, while the Italian collection goes back all the way to the 13th century, including the Florentine and Venetian Renaissance, with priceless works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian. A highlight is the enormous collection of Dutch and Flemish painting, in particular the spectacular assortment of Rembrandt, most notably his masterpiece Return of the Prodigal Son.
As much as you will see in the museum, there’s about 20 times more in its vaults, part of which you can visit at the Hermitage Storage Facility. Other branches of the museum include the Winter Palace of Peter I, further east along the Neva, Menshikov Palace on Vasilyevsky Island, and the Imperial Porcelain factory in the south of the city.
Visiting the Hermitage
The Hermitage is a dynamic institution. Displays change, renovations continue, specific pieces go on tour, and temporary exhibitions occupy particular rooms, displacing whatever normally resides there, so be prepared for slight changes.
The main public entrance is via the courtyard of the Winter Palace off Palace Sq. Groups enter via doors facing onto the Palace Embankment (Dvortsovaya nab).
First-Floor Exhibits
To get here you’ll need to go up to the 2nd floor and then down via the stairs between Rooms 153 and 156 or between Rooms 289 and 288.
Rooms 11–24, 27 & 33: Prehistoric Artefacts
The prehistoric collection at the Hermitage contains thousands of artefacts dating from as far back as the Palaeolithic era (500,000 to 12,000 BC). Most of the items were excavated from different regions of the USSR during the Soviet era. The following are the highlights:
ARoom 12 Carved petroglyphs (dating to 2000 BC) were taken from the northeastern shores of Lake Onega after archaeological expeditions in 1935.
ARooms 13–14 Excavations of a burial mound in the northern Caucasus include the corpse of a nomadic chief, lavishly dressed and covered in jewels.
Rooms 26–32, 38–69: Siberian Antiquities, Central Asia & Caucasus
These excellent galleries present exhibits from Central Asia, Siberia and the Caucasus, dating as far back as the 10th century BC.
ARoom 26 Contains mummified human corpses that are more than 2000 years old, as well as a fantastically reconstructed wooden cart.
ARooms 47–51 Feature impressive 7th- and 8th-century relics from Panjakent in present-day Tajikistan.
ARooms 67-69 Feature art and artefacts of the Golden Horde, which swept through Russia in the 13th and 14th centuries.
Rooms 89–91: Ancient Near East
These rooms house a very impressive collection of cuneiform texts from Babylon and Assyrian limestone reliefs.

Room 100: Ancient Egypt
This large hall houses an incredible collection of ancient Egyptian artefacts uncovered by Russian archaeologists. The display spans the Egyptian era from the Old Kingdom (3000–2400 BC) to the New Empire (1580–1050 BC). There are many painted sarcophagi and tombstones carved with hieroglyphics, as well as a fascinating mummy from the 10th century BC.
Rooms 106–131: Greek & Roman Antiquities
The Hermitage has more than 100,000 items from Ancient Greece and Rome, including thousands of painted vases, antique gemstones, Roman sculpture and Greek gold.
ARoom 107 The Jupiter Hall is a sumptuous space with portraits of sculptors on the ceiling.
ARoom 108 Designed by German neoclassicist architect and painter von Klenze to imitate a Roman courtyard.
ARoom 109 Peter I acquired the sculpture Aphrodite (Tauride Venus) from Pope Clement XI. This piece – a Roman copy of a Greek original – was the first antique sculpture ever brought to Russia.
ARoom 111 Another impressive design by von Klenze, this one was intended to be a library (which explains the philosophers’ profiles).
ARoom 130 Hall of Twenty Columns, containing a fabulous collection of Greco-Roman clay urns.
Second-Floor Highlights
On the 2nd floor you'll find the Hermitage’s unbeatable Western European collection and its grandest state rooms.
Rooms 151–189: Russian Culture & Imperial Apartments
Most of the western wing of the Winter Palace contains the huge collection from ancient Rus (10th to 15th centuries) through to the 18th century, including artefacts, icons, portraits and furniture. Also here are the private apartments of the last tsar, Nicholas II, and the imperial family. Many of these rooms were completed in 1894, and they now show off elaborate 19th-century interiors.
ARooms 151 & 153 This long corridor, broken up by a vast clock, contains portraits of all the Russian tsars from Peter the Great to Nicholas II.
ARooms 155–156 Moorish Dining Room and Rotunda.
ARooms 157–162 The Petrovsky Gallery displays personal effects and equipment used by Peter the Great, as well as some beautiful early-18th-century furniture. Look for the ivory chandelier that was partly built by Peter himself.
ARoom 161 In 1880 there was an attempt on the life of Alexander II in this room. A young revolutionary, Khalturin, planted a bomb in the room below. It killed 11 soldiers when it went off, although the tsar had wandered into another room at the time.
ARoom 178 Nicholas II spent much of his time in this wonderful Gothic library, topped with a sublime walnut ceiling.
ARoom 181 The relatively small and intimate Pompeii dining room.
ARoom 187 The griffin-motif furniture in this palace drawing room dates from 1805.
ARoom 188 This small dining room is where the Provisional Government was arrested by the Bolsheviks in 1917.
ARoom 189 Two tonnes of gorgeous green columns, boxes, bowls and urns have earned this room the name ‘Malachite Hall’, and it is one of the most striking rooms in the entire palace. The handiwork of architect Alexander Bryullov, it was completed in 1839. Three figurines on the wall represent Day, Night and Poetry. This was where the last meeting of the 1917 Provisional Government occurred, on the fateful nights of 25 and 26 October 1917; they were arrested soon after, in the Small Dining Room next door.
Rooms 190–192: Neva Enfilade
These three grand ceremonial halls are often used for temporary exhibitions.
ARoom 190 This Concert Hall was used for small soirées. The enormous ornate silver tomb was commissioned by Empress Elizabeth for the remains of Alexander Nevsky.
ARoom 191 As many as 5000 guests could be entertained in the Great Hall (also called Nicholas Hall). The palace’s largest room was the scene of imperial winter balls.
ARoom 192 This anteroom was used for pre-ball champagne buffets.

Rooms 193–198: Great Enfilade
You’ll find more state rooms here.
ARoom 193 Field Marshals’ Hall is known for its military-themed chandelier and its portraits of seven of Russia’s military leaders.
ARoom 194 The Hall of Peter the Great contains his none-too-comfy throne.
ARoom 195 This gilt Armorial Hall contains chandeliers engraved with the coat-of-arms of all the Russian provinces.
ARoom 197 The 1812 War Gallery is hung with 332 portraits of Russian and allied Napoleonic war leaders.
ARoom 198 St George’s Hall served as the state rooms where the imperial throne used to sit. With white Carrara marble imported from Italy and floors crafted from the wood of 16 different tree species, it is a splendid affair.
Room 204: Pavilion Hall & Hanging Garden
The ceremonial Pavilion Hall is an airy white-and-gold room sparkling with 28 chandeliers and the famous Peacock Clock. The south windows look on to Catherine the Great’s hanging garden (built over the stables), while the north overlooks the Neva. The amazing floor mosaic in front of the windows is a copy of that in the Roman bath of Otricoli (Ocriculum) near Rome.
Rooms 207–238: Italian Art
Covering 30-plus rooms, the Hermitage’s collection of Italian art traverses the 13th to the 18th centuries. The highlights are certainly the works by the Renaissance artists: Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Giorgione and Titian. Look also for Botticelli, Caravaggio and Tiepolo.
ARoom 207 The earliest example in this collection is The Crucifixion, painted by Ugolino di Tedice in the second half of the 13th century.
ARoom 214 Of a dozen or so original paintings by da Vinci that exist in the world, two are here. The very different Benois Madonna (1478) and Madonna Litta (1490) are named after their last owners. For years, the latter was considered lost. However, in 1909, the Russian architect Leon Benois surprised the art world when he revealed that it was part of his father-in-law’s collection.
ARoom 217 Giorgione is one of the most mysterious painters of the Renaissance, as only a few paintings exist that are known for certain to be his work. A portrait of idealised beauty, Judith is said to represent the inseparability of life and death.
ARoom 221 The work of Titian, the best representative of the Venetian school during the 16th century, is featured here: Danaya and St Sebastian are widely accepted as two of his masterpieces.
ARoom 224 Accessed off this room is the Hermitage Theatre; there are lovely views from the connecting corridor over the Neva.
ARooms 226–227: Loggia of Raphael When Catherine the Great visited the Vatican she was so impressed that she commissioned Quarenghi to create this copy of a Vatican gallery; a team of Raphael’s students recreated the master’s murals on canvas. Note the occasional Russification on these versions: the two-headed eagle of the Romanov dynasty replaces the papal coat-of-arms.
ARoom 229 Here you’ll enjoy two pieces by Raphael, The Holy Family and Madonna and Child, as well as many pieces by his disciples.
ARoom 230 Contains the Hermitage’s only piece by Michelangelo, a marble statue of a crouching boy.
ARooms 237–238 These Italian Skylight Halls are bathed in natural light, which highlights the ornately moulded ceilings.
Rooms 239–240: Spanish Art
Ranging from the 16th to the 18th centuries, this collection includes the most noteworthy artists of this ‘Golden Age’ of Spanish painting: Murillo, Ribera and, of course, Velázquez. The collection also includes two remarkable paintings from the 16th century: the marvellous St Peter and St Paul, by El Greco, and St Sebastian Cured by St Irene, by Ribera.
Room 243: Knights’ Hall
Nicholas I started collecting artistic weapons and armaments from around the world. Here is the Western European collection, featuring four impressive 16th-century German knights sitting atop their armoured horses.
Rooms 245–247: Flemish Art
These three rooms dedicated to 17th-century Flanders are almost entirely consumed by three artists: Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony Van Dyck and Frans Snyders.
Rooms 249–254: Dutch Art
Dating from the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch collection contains more than 1000 pieces. The 26 paintings by Rembrandt in Room 254 nearly outshine anything else in these rooms. The collection traces his career, starting with Flora and The Descent from the Cross, which are noticeably lighter but more detailed. His later work tends to be darker and more penetrating, such as the celebrated The Return of the Prodigal Son. Painted between 1663 and 1665, it arguably represents the height of Rembrandt’s mastery of psychology in his paintings. The solemn baroque masterpiece is a moving portrait of unquestioning parental love and mercy.
Rooms 263–268: German Art
This small collection of German art ranges from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Among the earliest works here are five paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder.
Room 271: Great Church
Looking splendid following a major renovation completed in 2014, this Rastrelli-designed chapel is one of the Winter Palace's most dazzling spaces, with a white and gilt dome and the ceiling painting The Ascension of Christ by Pyotr Basin.
Rooms 272–288 & 290–297: French Art & Interiors
These rooms trace the development of French art from the 15th to the 18th centuries, including tapestries, ceramics, metalwork and paintings. Look for rooms devoted to Nicholas Poussin, founder of French classicism, and Claude Lorrain, master of the classical landscape. Room 282, Alexander Hall, is a testament to the victory over Napoleon in 1812.
Rooms 298–301: British Art
These rooms showcase 15th- to 18th-century British art. Highlights include:
ARoom 298 Portrait of a Lady in Blue, by Thomas Gainsborough, perhaps the most famous piece in the English collection.
ARoom 300 The Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpents by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which was commissioned by Catherine the Great to symbolise the growing strength of Russia.
Third-Floor Highlights
Access to Rooms 314–332, some of which are used for temporary exhibitions, is via stairs off Rooms 269 or 280 on the 2nd floor. The Far East, Central Asia and Islamic Near East collections are reached via the stairs off Rooms 302 or 156 also on the 2nd floor.
Rooms 351–391: Oriental & Middle Eastern Culture & Art
Art from the Far East, including China, Japan, Tibet, Indonesia, Mongolia and India, can be found in rooms 351 to 376. Rooms 381 to 391 have some wonderful works from Byzantium and Iran including fantastic early 19th-century portraits of Fat'h Ali Shah by Mihr' Ali. Room 391 provides a panoramic view across the Neva from the northwest corner of the Winter Palace.
TREASURE GALLERY

For lovers of things that glitter and the applied arts, the Hermitage's Treasure Gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-571 8446; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Winter Palace, Dvortsovaya pl; tour of Diamond or Golden Rooms R350; mAdmiralteyskaya) should not be missed. These two special collections, guarded behind vault doors, are open only by guided tour, for which you should either call ahead to reserve a place, or buy a ticket at the entrance. The Golden Rooms collection focuses on a hoard of fabulous Scythian and Greek gold and silver from the Caucasus, Crimea and Ukraine, dating from the 7th to 2nd centuries BC; the Diamond Rooms section has fabulous jewellery from Western Europe and pieces from as far apart as China, India and Iran.
HERMITAGE TIPS

AAvoid possibly long entrance queues by buying your ticket online. The printed-out voucher or PDF on a wi-fi–enabled device is valid for 180 days.
AAlternatively pay at the computerised ticket machines in the main entrance courtyard and be sure to wait for your tickets to be printed at the end of the transaction (they come after the payment receipt).
AIf you leave jackets and bags in the cloakroom, be aware that you can’t go back for anything without leaving the museum.
AHandbags, small shoulder bags and plastic bags are allowed in the Hermitage, but backpacks aren’t.
AThere is good provision of toilets throughout the Hermitage – don’t make the rookie mistake of thinking that those at the foot of the Jordan Staircase as you enter are the only ones available, as the lines (especially for women) can be very long indeed.

TAKING A BREAK

Eating options in the Hermitage are not great, limited to busy self-serve cafes on the ground-floor corridor between the foot of the Jordan staircase and Room 100.
Yat serves excellent Russian food in a charming atmosphere but a booking is advisable.
If you want to escape the crowds, head to Rooms 1 to 65 on the 1st floor which contain prehistoric relics as well as treasures from Siberia, Central Asia and the Caucasus. Due to the layout of the museum, you have to go up to the 2nd floor and then back down the stairs on the left side of the main entrance to get here. Because of this, you’ll find you have many of the galleries down here almost entirely to yourself.
JORDAN STAIRCASE

The main staircase of the Winter Palace – a magnificent creation of Bartolomeo Rastrelli – was originally known as the Ambassadorial Staircase. However, in the 19th century it became known as the Jordan Staircase as every year on 6 January the imperial family would descend these stairs to the Neva River for the celebration of Christ’s baptism in the River Jordan.
RUSSIAN ARK

Wander with a ghost through 33 rooms of the Hermitage and 300 years of Russian history in Russian Ark (2002). Director Alexander Sokurov shot the movie in one continuous 96-minute take in the Winter Palace.
Rooms 289 and 304–308 comprise the private apartments of Tsar Alexander II. Most spectacular is Room 304, the Golden Drawing Room, which features a fabulous gilt ceiling and a marble fireplace with an intricate mosaic over the mantle.
PEACOCK CLOCK

The centrepiece of the Pavilion Hall (Room 204) is the incredible Peacock Clock, created by James Cox and gifted to Catherine the Great in 1781 by Grigory Potemkin. A revolving dial in one of the toadstools tells the time: as it strikes the hour the automaton peacock spreads its wings and the toadstools, owl and cock come to life. A video beside the clock shows the action in close-up detail should you not be around for the once-weekly performance at 7pm on Wednesday.

GENERAL STAFF BUILDING
The east wing of this magnificent building, wrapping around the south of Palace Sq and designed by Carlo Rossi in the 1820s, marries immaculately restored interiors with contemporary architecture to create a series of galleries displaying the Hermitage's amazing collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist works. Contemporary works are displayed here, too, often in temporary exhibitions by major artists.

New Grand Enfilade
Entry to the galleries is via a new marble staircase, which doubles as an amphitheatre for musical performances. On the 1st floor a 'New Grand Enfilade' of lofty exhibition rooms has been created by throwing a glass ceiling over the building's interior courtyards. Among the giant works on display here are Ilya and Emilia Kabakov's Red Wagon installation and the restored 19th-century German and Austrian canvases from the Steiglitz Mansion on the English Embankment.
Off this central corridor are smaller galleries for temporary exhibitions as well as a beautifully restored trio of rooms that once housed the Imperial Russian Ministry of Finance.
The Art of Empire
Continuing up to the 2nd floor you find the following rooms:
ARooms 300–302 Contain a small collection of pieces by Carl Fabergé.
ARooms 307–316 French 19th-century painting and sculpture including Jean-Léon Gérôme's sultry Pool in a Harem which was stolen from the Hermitage in 2001 only to be mysteriously returned five years later.
ARooms 317–330 Beautifully decorated state rooms overlooking Palace Sq with art and decorative arts from 19th-century Russia; in Room 329 there's an amazing costume worn by Alexander I for an initiation ceremony.
ARooms 333–338 Once occupied by Russian Foreign Ministry.
ARooms 340–352 Nineteenth-century Western European art including works by Caspar David Friedrich.
Impressionists & Post-Impressionists
The 3rd-floor galleries house the Hermitage's collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings, arguably the best in the world. Much of this artwork was displayed for the first time in the 1990s, when the museum revealed some fabulous pieces, kept secret since seizure by the Red Army from Germany at the end of WWII.
Start with the following rooms:
ARoom 403 Monet's early piece Lady in a Garden and his late-career masterpiece Waterloo Bridge, Effect of Mist (1903).
ARooms 407 & 408 Renoir's celebrated Portrait of the Actress Jeanne Samary (1878) and the iconic Child With a Whip (1885).
ARoom 410 Cézanne's Mont Sainte-Victoire, Lady in Blue and The Smoker.
ARooms 411 & 412 Works by Gauguin including the primitive works that he created in Tahiti.
ARoom 413 Van Gogh's Thatched Cottages (1890) and the dreamy Memory of the Garden at Etten (1888).
Barbizon School
Next to Room 452 (where you'll find three sculptures by Rodin) is a series of unnumbered rooms displaying works from the Barbizon School, named for the village in France where this group of artists settled. They were reacting against romanticism, the prevailing school of art for the earlier part of the 19th century, and making a move towards realism. Gustave Courbet, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Théôdore Rousseau and Jean-François Millet are all represented.
Russian Avant-Garde
Russian avant-garde art is not a strong point of the Hermitage (if this is what you're looking for, try the Russian Museum). That said, the General Staff Building does display a couple of Kandinsky’s early works in Room 444 along with Kazimir Malevich's Black Square (1915), the most striking painting of the Petrograd avant-garde. Malevich created several variants of the simple black square against a white background throughout his career, of which this is the fourth and last. It was taken by many as a nihilistic declaration of the ‘end of painting’, causing both awe and outrage.
20th Century
Rooms 430 to 440 are where the big guns of the Hermitage's 20th-century works are shown. On display are over 40 paintings by Matisse and almost as many by Picasso. Henri Matisse was initially classified as a Fauvist, but he continued to paint in his own particular style, even as Fauvism declined in the early 20th century. Around this time, Matisse met Pablo Picasso and the two became lifelong friends. Picasso is best known as the founder and master of cubism, but again his work spanned many styles.
A turning point for Matisse – and perhaps his most famous work – is The Dance (1910). The intense colours and the dancing nudes convey intense feelings of freedom. This panel – along with the accompanying The Music – was painted specifically for Russian businessman Sergei Shchukin. While these panels are certainly commanding, don’t miss The Red Room and Portrait of the Artist’s Wife.
Picasso’s blue period is characterised by sombre paintings in shades of blue. When he was only 22, he painted The Absinthe Drinker, a haunting portrait of loneliness and isolation. The sensuous Dance of the Veils (1907) and Woman with a Fan (1908) are excellent representations of his cubist work, as are the ceramics on display here.
BLACK SQUARE

Kazimir Malevich’s Black Square went missing during the Soviet period, mysteriously reappearing in southern Russia in 1993. Oligarch Vladimir Potanin bought the painting for $US1 million and donated it to the Hermitage in 2002.
Inspired by romanticism, a group of painters in the 1860s began experimenting with painting modern life and landscapes, endeavouring to capture the overall effect of a scene instead of being overly concerned with details. The new trend – radical in its time – was known as Impressionism.
TAKE A BREAK

Unlike at the Winter Palace, the General Staff Building's Cafe Hermitage (Кафе Эрмитаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-703 7528; General Staff Bldg, 8 Dvortsovaya pl; mains R250-450; h11am-11pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, until 8pm Wed & Fri; mAdmiralteyskaya) is a pleasant self-serve place for light refreshments or an affordable meal.

RUSSIAN MUSEUM
Focusing solely on Russian art, from ancient church icons to 20th-century paintings, the Russian Museum's collection is magnificent and can easily be viewed in half a day or less. The collection is less overwhelming than that of the Hermitage, but the masterpieces nonetheless keep on coming as you tour the Mikhailovsky Palace and the attached Benois Wing.


vserg48 / shutterstock ©
The Museum's Collection
Mikhailovsky Palace was designed by Carlo Rossi and built between 1819 and 1825. It was a gift for Grand Duke Mikhail (brother of Tsars Alexander I and Nicholas I) as compensation for missing out on the throne. Nicholas II opened it as a public gallery on 7 March 1898.
The museum originated from the collection begun by Tsar Alexander III, whose bust greets you on the magnificent main staircase. The collection now numbers around 400,000 pieces (the Russian Museum also manages several other palaces, plus the Mikhailovsky and Summer Gardens). On display are a superb range of ancient icons, paintings, graphic art, sculpture, and folk, decorative and applied art. The collection of avant-garde works is particularly notable, including pieces by Nathan Altman, Natalya Goncharova, Kazimir Malevich and Alexander Rodchenko.
The museum’s Benois Wing houses pieces from the 20th century as well as temporary exhibitions. It was constructed between 1914 and 1919 and is connected to the original palace. It is accessible through an entrance on nab kanala Griboyedova.
Visiting the Russian Museum
Enter the Mikhailovsky Palace's lower floor to the right of the main facade. Pick up a museum map before ascending the magnificent main staircase to the 1st floor, as this is where the chronological ordering of the exhibits from the 10th to the 20th century begins.
Galleries close for restoration and rehangings from time to time, and works are sometimes loaned out, so be prepared for slight changes to the following.
Rooms 1–4: Religious Icons
The first four rooms of the museum encapsulate a succinct but brilliant history of Russian icon painting, including work from the three major schools of Russian icon painting: Novgorod, Muscovy and Pskov. Room 2 has St Nicholas the Miracle Worker with Life, while Room 3 features Russian master Andrei Rublev’s massive paintings of the apostles Peter and Paul as well as his Presentation. Room 4 is notable in its departure from earlier styles. Compare Old Testament Trinity with Scenes from Genesis (c. 1408) with the completely atypical Our Father (1669).

Rooms 5–7: Petrine & Post-Petrine Art
Peter the Great was a great patron of the arts and almost single-handedly brought the Western eye to Russian painting, as witnessed by the massive jump in style from ecclesiastical to secular subjects between Rooms 4 and 5. The rooms include three busts of Peter and two portraits.
Room 6 includes some charmingly odd canvases in very strange shapes as well as mosaic portraits of both Peter and Catherine the Great, as well as of Elizabeth I, Peter’s daughter. The centre of the room is taken up by a huge portrait of the ill-fated Peter III, but look out for the impressive bust of Prince Menshikov. Room 7 has an amazingly ornate ceiling. The room houses a sculpture of Empress Anna with an Arab Boy and a few impressive tapestries, including one that depicts Peter the Great at the Battle of Poltava, his greatest military victory.
Rooms 8–11: Rise of the Academy
These rooms display the early works of the St Petersburg Academy of Arts. These artists borrowed the European classical aesthetic for their work. Look for portraits in Rooms 8 and 10 (including two portraits and a full-sized sculpture of Catherine the Great in Room 10) and biblical themes in Room 9.
Room 11 is the Rossi-designed White Hall, which was Grand Duke Mikhail’s drawing room. Here, the interior is the art – in this case representing the Empire epoch. It’s wonderfully ornate and shiny – a perfect place to host musical greats like Strauss and Berlioz, who performed here.

Rooms 12–17: Dominance of the Academy
By the early 19th century the Academy of Arts was more and more influenced by Italian themes, given the unfashionability of France. In Room 12 look for Vladimir Borovikovsky’s magnificent Catherine II Promenading in Tsarskoe Selo and his Portrait of Murtaza Kuli, his picture of the brother of the Persian Shah. Room 13 is full of paintings of peasant subjects with uplifting titles such as Peeling Beetroot.
Room 14 is truly spectacular, including enormous canvases such as Karl Bryullov’s incredible The Last Day of Pompeii and The Crucifixion, and Ivan Aivazovsky's terrifying The Wave.
Room 15 is also impressive, with the far wall made up of studies for Alexander Ivanov’s masterpiece The Appearance of Christ Before the People (1837–57), which hangs in Moscow’s Tretyakov Gallery. Ivanov spent 20 years on this work, but it was met with a negative critical reception. However, later generations appreciated the work, and even these studies, many of which mark a notable departure in terms of detail and representation.
Rooms 18–22: Genre Painting
At the turn of the 19th century, it became fashionable for ‘genre painting’ to look to themes from (an incredibly idealised) rural Russia, which you can see in Rooms 18 and 20. Room 19 has some beautiful portraits by Ivan Kramskoi, including ones of his daughter Sofia and fellow painter Ivan Shishkin.
Room 21 contains some enormous canvases: Phrina at the Poseidon Celebration in Elesium by Genrikh Semiradsky, Christian Martyrs at the Colosseum by Konstantin Flavitsky and Nero’s Death by Vasily Smirnov. Room 22 is dominated by a huge rendition of Pugachev's Judgement by Vasily Perov.
Rooms 23–24: The Wanderers
In these galleries you'll find works by the Wanderers (Peredvizhniki), a group of Academy artists who saw their future outside the strict confines of that institution. They wandered among the people, painting scenes of realism that had never been seen before in Russian art. Prime examples include Nikolai Perov's animated Hunters at Rest and the Monastery Refectory, a scathing critique of the Church establishment's greed. Also keep an eye out for Pavel Christiakov's serene Jovannina Sitting on Window Sill.
Rooms 25 & 26: Konstantin Makovsky & Nicholas Ghe
Room 25 is devoted to Konstantin Makovsky (1839–1915), who painted the incredibly cinematic Festivity During the Carnival on Admiralty Sq in St Petersburg at the age of just 30. Also a standout is his portrait of his wife Julija.
Ghe’s masterpiece, Peter I Interrogating Tsarevich Alexey in Peterhof, is usually found in Room 26 along with other dark Ghe works such as The Last Supper.
Rooms 27–32: Landscapes & Portraits
Contemporaries of the Wanderers, landscape artists such as Ivan Shishkin were still popular. These rooms also document the rise of populist art, which had a strong social conscience and sought to educate the public. Examples of this are Konstantin Savitsky’s To War (Room 31) and Grigory Myasoyedov's lyrical Harvest Time.
In Room 28 pause to take in the talent of Ukrainian artist Marie Bashkirtseff (1858–84) who died young but not before painting striking portraits, such as Umbrella and the Three Smiles series.
Rooms 33–34: Ilya Repin
Take your time viewing several masterpieces by Ilya Repin (1844–1930), one of Russia’s most famous painters. The iconic Barge Haulers on the Volga is an incredible picture, as is Cossacks Writing a Letter to the Turkish Sultan. There is also his marvellous portrait of a barefoot Leo Tolstoy.
Rooms 35–47: Late-19th-Century Russian Art
These rooms display the large number of contradictory styles that were fashionable in St Petersburg before the explosion of the avant-garde. These include Vasily Surikov, a master of the historical painting that was in vogue in the late 19th century. His portrayals of Yermak’s Conquest of Siberia and Suvorov Crossing the Alps (Room 36) are particularly dramatic, but the lifelike rendition of Cossack rebel Stepan Razin (Room 37) is undoubtedly his most evocative.
Rooms 48–49: Antokolsky’s Sculptures & Folk Art
Mark Antokolsky’s statues Ivan the Terrible and Death of Socrates are on display either side of a souvenir stand. From here you enter the Benois Wing to your right or continue straight ahead for the comprehensive account of Russian folk art, a really lovely display featuring everything from kitchen equipment to giant carved house gables. Room 49 is a long corridor devoted to the museum's history showcasing old photos and posters from past exhibitions.

Rooms 66–71: Early-20th-Century Art
On the 2nd floor of the Benois Wing, the collection moves into the 20th century with works by the father of modern Russian art, Mikhail Vrubel (1856–1910) in Room 66. Some of his groundbreaking works include Epic Hero (Bogatyr) and Flying Demon.
Rooms 67 to 71 include works by an array of important early-20th-century painters including Nikolai Sapunin, Mikhail Nesterov and Boris Kustodiev, whose Merchant’s Wife at Tea is perhaps the most well-known picture here.
Rooms 72–78: Russian Avant-Garde Painting
Between 1905 and 1917, the Russian art world experienced an explosion of creative inspiration that defied the stylistic categorisation that had existed before. Room 72 is home to Nathan Altman’s gorgeous, semi-cubist Portrait of the Poetess Anna Akhmatova, painted in 1914, and it remains one of his most famous works even though Akhmatova apparently didn’t care for it herself. In the same room is Altman’s striking Self Portrait (1911). Room 74 contains primitivist paintings by artist couple Natalya Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov.
Futurism and suprematism, including works by Malevich such as Black Square and Vladimir Tatlin's Counter Relief, can be found in Rooms 75 to 76. Room 77 is devoted to constructivism and features works by Alexander Rodchenko and Vladimir Lebedev. Room 78 displays the bright, ethereal work of Pavel Filonov.
Rooms 80–81: Early Soviet Art
Most paintings from the Stalin era may have been censored beyond meaning, but there are some interesting portraits of daily life here, such as Alexander Samokhvalov’s Militarised Komsomol (1932–33) and various pictures from WWII showing heroic resistance and national unity.
Rooms 82–86: Late Soviet Art
With Stalin gone and the ‘thaw’ under way in the 1950s, Soviet art recovered somewhat from the severity of socialist realism. Idealised images of rural life and peasants still feature very strongly, however. Look for Alexei Sundukov's Queue which captures the failed economy of the times and Dmitry Zhilinsky's The Artist's Family, showing several generations of a family.
Rooms 87–94: Applied & Decorative Art
Works in these galleries range from a beautifully glazed ceramic fireplace by Mikhail Vrubel and other art nouveau–inspired pieces, to Soviet-era porcelain and textiles printed with ingenious patterns made out of tiny tractors or planes.
Rooms 101–109: Temporary Exhibitions
The Russian Museum's temporary exhibitions are hung on the ground-floor galleries either side of entrance to the Benois Wing. To reach these from the 1st floor of the Benois Wing (following your tour of the museum's main collection), use the stairs down off rooms 91 and 92.
OTHER BRANCHES OF THE RUSSIAN MUSEUM

AThe Russian Museum also manages three other impressive palaces in the city centre, where you can view temporary exhibits, permanent collections and grand state rooms: the Marble Palace, the Stroganov Palace and Mikhailovsky Castle.
AOf the palaces, the Marble Palace has the best art collection, while the Stroganov Palace has the best interiors.
ACombined tickets, available at each palace, covers entrance either to your choice of two the same day (adult/student R600/270) or to all four within a three-day period (R850/400).
PETER I INTERROGATING TSAREVICH ALEXEY IN PETERHOF

Ghe's masterpiece captures the tumultuous relationship between Peter the Great and his son Alexey, whom he had imprisoned and tortured to death as he tried to extract information about ‘plotters’ against him. It foreshadows Alexey’s brutal end in the Peter and Paul Fortress. Initially the painting was met with such critical coldness Ghe declared that art should not be for sale, became a follower of Tolstoy, bought a farm and began painting portraits for a pittance so that anyone who wanted one could afford them.
TAKE A BREAK

The best place to eat within the museum is Grand Cafe Mikhailovsky ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Benois Wing, Russian Museum, nab kanala Griboyedova; mains R300; h10am-5pm Mon, Wed, Fri-Sun 10am-5pm, Thu 1-8pm; mNevsky Prospekt), in the Benois Wing, where you can enjoy a coffee and cake or a more substantial meal of three courses plus tea for just R380 between noon and 3pm.

ILYA REPIN

One of Russia's greatest artists, Ilya Repin was born in Chuhuiv, now part of Ukraine. Originally a member of the Wanderers, he outgrew the movement and went on to produce key works of Russian realist and populist art. His masterpiece, Barge Haulers on the Volga, an unrivalled portrait of human misery and enslavement in rural Russia, shows why the early Soviet authorities held him in high regard as a model for the Socialist Realist painters to come.

CHURCH ON THE SPILLED BLOOD
This five-domed dazzler is St Petersburg’s most elaborate church, with a classic Russian Orthodox exterior and an interior decorated with some 7000 sq m of mosaics. Officially called the Church of the Resurrection of Christ, its full colloquial name (Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood) references the assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II here in 1881.

Restored Beauty
The church, which was was consecrated in 1907, incorporates elements of 18th-century Russian architecture from Moscow and Yaroslavl, and is so lavish it took 24 years to build and went over budget by 1 million rubles – an enormous sum for the times. Decades of abuse and neglect during most of the Soviet era ended in the 1970s when restoration began. When the doors reopened 27 years later on what is now a museum, visitors were astounded by the spectacular mosaics covering the walls and ceilings. Designs for the mosaics came from top artists of the day including Victor Vasnetsov, Mikhail Nesterov and Andrey Ryabushkin.
The Exterior
The polychromatic exterior – decorated with mosaics of detailed scenes from the New Testament and the coats of arms of the provinces, regions and towns of the Russian Empire of Alexander’s time – is equally showstopping. Twenty granite plaques around the facade record the main events of Alexander’s reign.

ST ISAAC’S CATHEDRAL
Named after St Isaac of Dalmatia, on whose feast day Peter the Great was born, this is one of the largest domed buildings in the world. Most people bypass the museum to climb the 262 steps to the kolonnada (colonnade) around the drum of the dome; the outlook across the city is superb.


akedesign / shutterstock ©
Controversial Design
French architect Auguste de Montferrand began designing the cathedral in 1818. Due partly to technical issues, it took so long to build (until 1858) that Nicholas I was able to insist on an even more grandiose structure than Montferrand had originally planned. More than 100kg of gold leaf was used to cover the 21.8m-high dome alone, while the huge granite pillars on the building’s facade each weigh over 120 tonnes. There’s a statue of Montferrand holding a model of the cathedral on the west facade, although Nicholas I denied the architect his dying wish, to be buried here, considering it too high an honour for a mere artisan.
Interior Decoration
The cathedral’s interior is lavishly decorated with 600 sq m of mosaics, 16,000kg of malachite, 14 types of marble and an 816-sq-m ceiling painting by Karl Bryullov. Look out for some interesting photographs of the cathedral throughout its history, too.

PALACE SQUARESQUARE
(Дворцовая площадь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovaya pl; mAdmiralteyskaya)
This vast expanse is simply one of the most striking squares in the world, still redolent of imperial grandeur almost a century after the end of the Romanov dynasty. For the most amazing first impression, walk from Nevsky pr, up Bolshaya Morskaya ul and under the triumphal arch ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ).
In the centre of the square, the 47.5m Alexander Column (Алексaндровская колонна MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Palace Sq; mAdmiralteyskaya) was designed in 1834 by Montferrand. Named after Alexander I, it commemorates the 1812 victory over Napoleon.
The square’s northern end is capped by the Winter Palace (Zimny Dvorets), a rococo profusion of columns, windows and recesses, topped by rows of larger-than-life statues. A residence of tsars from 1762 to 1917, it’s now the largest part of the State Hermitage Museum.
Curving an incredible 580m around the south side of the square is the Carlo Rossi–designed General Staff Building completed in 1829. The east wing now houses a branch of the Hermitage while the west wing is the headquarters of the Western Military District. The two great blocks are joined by a triumphal arch over Bolshaya Morskaya ul, topped by the Chariot of Glory by sculptors Stepan Pimenov and Vasily Demuth-Malinovsky, another monument to the Napoleonic Wars.
NEVSKY PROSPEKTSTREET
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Nevsky Prospekt is Russia’s most famous street, running 4km from the Admiralty to Alexander Nevsky Monastery, from which it takes its name. The inner 2.5km to Moskovsky vokzal is the city’s shopping centre and focus of its entertainment and street life. Walking Nevsky is an essential St Petersburg experience. If you’re here on a holiday evening (such as 27 May – City Day), the sight of thousands of people pouring like a stream down its middle is one you’ll not forget.
Nevsky Prospekt was laid out in the early years of St Petersburg, as the start of the main road to Novgorod, and soon became dotted with fine buildings, squares and bridges. At the beginning of the 1900s, it was one of Europe’s grandest boulevards, with cobblestone footpaths and a track down the middle for horse-drawn trams. On either side of the tracks were wooden paving blocks to muffle the sound of horse-drawn carriages – an innovation that was a world-first and for which the avenue was dubbed the quietest main street in Europe.
Today, things are quite a bit noisier. The traffic and crowds can become oppressive and, after a while, you’ll find yourself going out of your way to avoid the street.
KAZAN CATHEDRALCHURCH
(Казанский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 4663; http://kazansky-spb.ru; Kazanskaya pl 2; h8.30am-7.30pm; mNevsky Prospekt)F
This neoclassical cathedral, partly modelled on St Peter’s in Rome, was commissioned by Tsar Paul shortly before he was murdered in a coup. Its 111m-long colonnaded arms reach out towards Nevsky pr, encircling a garden studded with statues. Inside, the cathedral is dark and traditionally Orthodox, with a daunting 80m-high dome. There is usually a queue of believers waiting to kiss the icon of Our Lady of Kazan, a copy of one of Russia’s most important icons.
Look for the victorious Napoleonic War field marshal Mikhail Kutuzov (whose remains are buried inside the cathedral) and his friend and aide Mikhail Barclay de Tolly.
The cathedral's design reflects Paul's eccentric desire to unite Catholicism and Orthodoxy in a kind of ‘super-Christianity’ as well as his fascination with the Knights of Malta, of which he was a member.
STROGANOV PALACEMUSEUM
(Строгановский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.rusmuseum.ru; Nevsky pr 17; adult/student R300/150; h10am-6pm Wed & Fri-Mon, 1-9pm Thu; mNevsky Prospekt)
One of the city’s loveliest baroque exteriors, the salmon-pink Stroganov Palace was designed by court favourite Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1753 for one of the city’s leading aristocratic families. The building has been superbly restored by the Russian Museum, and you can visit the impressive state rooms upstairs, where the Grand Dining Room, the Mineralogical Study and the Rastrelli Hall, with its vast frieze ceiling, are the obvious highlights.
Famously, the Stroganov’s chef created here a beef dish served in a sour cream and mushroom sauce that became known to the world as ‘beef stroganoff’.

This branch of the Russian Museum features temporary exhibitions of contemporary art and a permanent display of paintings from the Ludwig Museum in Cologne that includes works by Picasso, Warhol, Basquiat and Liechtenstein. The palace, designed by Antonio Rinaldi, gets its name from the 36 kinds of marble used in its construction. Highlights include the Gala Staircase, made of subtly changing grey Urals marble; and the impressive Marble Hall, with walls of lapis lazuli and marble in a range of colours from yellow to pink.
Built between 1768 and 1785, the palace was a gift from Catherine the Great to Grigory Orlov for suppressing a Moscow rebellion. Outside it stands the equestrian statue of Alexander III.
SUMMER GARDENPARK
(Летний сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 0374; https://igardens.ru; nab reki Moyki; tours from R1200; h10am-10pm May-Sep, 10am-8pm Oct-Mar, closed Apr; mGostiny Dvor)F
The city's oldest park, these leafy, shady gardens can be entered either at the northern Neva or southern Moyka end. Early-18th-century architects designed the garden in a Dutch baroque style, following a geometric plan, with fountains, pavilions and sculptures studding the grounds. The ornate cast-iron fence along the Neva side was a later addition, built between 1771 and 1784.
The gardens functioned as a private retreat for Peter the Great (his modest Summer Palace ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812 314 0374; Muzey Letny Dvorets Petra 1), closed for renovations, is here) before becoming a strolling place for St Petersburg’s 19th-century leisured classes. Only in the 20th century were commoners admitted.
Tours can be booked in advance or at the Teahouse which is the best of several cafes to be found in the gardens and which occasionally hosts music concerts on summer evenings.
The 92 marble statues, busts and sculptural groups that decorate parts of the garden are replicas: the 18th-century originals are housed in the Mikhailovsky Castle.
MIKHAILOVSKY CASTLEMUSEUM
(Михайловский замок MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-595 4248; www.rusmuseum.ru; Sadovaya ul 2; adult/student R300/150; h10am-6pm Mon, Wed & Fri-Sun, 1-9pm Thu; mGostiny Dvor)
A branch of the Russian Museum, the castle is worth visiting for its temporary exhibits as well as a few finely restored state rooms, including the lavish burgundy and gilt throne room of Tsar Paul I’s wife Maria Fyodorovna.
Rastrelli’s original fairytale wooden palace for Empress Elizabeth was knocked down in the 1790s to make way for this bulky edifice, a bizarre take on a medieval castle, quite unlike any other building in the city.
The son of Catherine the Great, Tsar Paul I, was born in the wooden palace and he wanted his own residence on the same spot. He specified a defensive moat as he (quite rightly) feared assassination. But this erratic, cruel tsar only got 40 days in his new abode before he was suffocated in his bedroom in 1801.
In 1823 the palace became a military engineering school (hence its Soviet-era name, Engineer’s Castle, or Inzhenerny Zamok), whose most famous pupil was Fyodor Dostoevsky.
MIKHAILOVSKY GARDENPARK
(Михайловский сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://igardens.ru; h10am-10pm May-Sep, 10am-8pm Oct-Mar, closed Apr; mNevsky Prospekt)F
Administered by the Russian Museum, these 8.7-hectare gardens are lovely and offer an impressive perspective of Mikhailovsky Castle. They are famous for their Style Moderne wrought-iron fence and gates, a profusion of metallic blooms and flourishes that wrap around one side of the Church on the Spilled Blood.
BRONZE HORSEMANMONUMENT
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Senatskaya pl; mSadovaya)
The most famous statue of Peter the Great was immortalised as the Bronze Horseman in the epic poem by Alexander Pushkin. With his horse (representing Russia) rearing above the snake of treason, Peter’s enormous statue was sculpted over 12 years for Catherine the Great by Frenchman Etienne Falconet. Its inscription reads ‘To Peter I from Catherine II – 1782’.
Many have read significance into Catherine’s linking of her own name with that of the city’s founder: she had no legitimate claim to the throne and this statue is sometimes seen as her attempt to formalise the link (philosophical, if not hereditary) between the two monarchs. The significance of the inscription in both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets would not have been lost on the city’s population, which was still in the process of Westernisation during Catherine’s reign.
Despite completing his lifework here, Falconet departed Russia a bitter, angry man. Years of arguing with the head of the Academy of Fine Arts over the finer details of the sculpture had taken its toll, and he didn’t even bother staying for the unveiling.
It’s tradition for local newlyweds to be photographed here after their weddings, so expect to see plenty of jolly wedding parties.
RUSSIAN MUSEUM OF ETHNOGRAPHYMUSEUM

This excellent museum displays the traditional crafts, customs and beliefs of more than 150 cultures that make up Russia’s fragile ethnic mosaic. It’s a marvellous collection with particularly strong sections on the Jews of Russia, Transcaucasia and Central Asia, including rugs and two full-size yurts (nomads’ portable tent-houses). Galleries are accessed either side of the magnificent 1000-sq-m Marble Hall, flanked by rows of pink Karelian-marble columns, in which events and concerts are held.
You need to buy an extra ticket to view the treasure room, which has some great weapons and rare devotional objects.

Excavations beneath the Hermitage Theatre in the late 1970s revealed remains of the principal residence of Peter the Great, including a large fragment of the former state courtyard, as well as several suites of palace apartments. Some rooms have been restored to their appearance during Peter’s era, complete with Dutch tiles and parquet floors, and are used to exhibit some of Peter’s personal items from the Hermitage collection.
The cobbled courtyard has one of Peter’s official carriages and a sledge. In the last room before you leave, don't miss the wax effigy of Peter made by Bartolomeo Rastrelli after the tsar died in the palace in 1725.
ADMIRALTYARCHITECTURE
(Адмиралтейство MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Admiralteysky proezd 1; mAdmiralteyskaya)
The gilded spire of the Admiralty is a prime St Petersburg landmark, visible from Gorokhovaya ul, Voznesensky pr and Nevsky pr, as all of these roads radiate outwards from this central point. From 1711 to 1917, this spot was the headquarters of the Russian navy; now it houses the country’s largest military naval college and is closed to the public.
The building itself was reconstructed between 1806 and 1823 to the designs of Andreyan Zakharov. With its rows of white columns and its plentiful reliefs and statuary, it is a foremost example of the Russian Empire style. Get a close look at the globe-toting nymphs flanking the main gate. Despite the spire’s solid-gold appearance, it’s actually made from wood and was almost rotted through before restoration efforts began in 1996.
ALEXANDER GARDENPARK
(Александровский сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Admiralteysky pr; mAdmiralteyskaya)F
Laid out from 1872 to 1874, these pleasant gardens, named after Alexander II, wrap around the Admiralty and are mentioned in Pushkin's famous verse novel Eugene Onegin as a fashionable place for a stroll. They remain so, dotted with statues of Glinka, Lermontov, Gogol and other cultural figures, as well as a fountain that dates to 1879. Opposite St Isaac's there's a very good children's playground within the garden.

Alexander Pushkin, Russia’s national poet, had his last home here on one of the prettiest curves of the Moyka River. He only lived here four months, and died here after his duel in 1837. The little house is now the Pushkin Flat-Museum, which has been reconstructed to look exactly as it did in the poet’s last days.

In the very same building that housed the tsarist and the Bolshevik secret police offices, this small museum recounts the history of this controversial institution and includes one room that recreates the office of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka (Bolshevik secret police). Each of the remaining three rooms is devoted to the secret police during a different period of history: the tsarist police, the Cheka and the KGB.
Exhibitions are heavy on photographs and documents, but some of them are fascinating. Some explanatory materials are available in English.
MARS FIELDPARK
(Марсово поле MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab Lebyazhey kanavki; mNevsky Prospekt)
Named after the Roman god of war and once the scene of 19th-century military parades, the grassy Mars Field is a popular spot for strollers, even though in the early 20th century it was used as a burial ground for victims and heroes of the revolution. At its centre, an eternal flame ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) has been burning since 1957 in memory of the victims of all wars and revolutions in St Petersburg.
LUTHERAN CHURCHCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 0798; www.petrikirche.ru; Nevsky pr 22; h9am-9pm; mNevsky Prospekt)F
Tucked in a recess between Bolshaya and Malaya Konyushennaya uls is this lovely church, in the Romantic-Gothic style, built for St Petersburg’s thriving German community in the 1830s. It's distinguished by a four-column portico and topped with a discreet cupola. Concerts are also held here, including free ones when the church organ is played.
There's an exhibition in the upstairs gallery about the city's German population and the church, which during Soviet times housed a swimming pool (the high diving board was placed in the apse).
BRODSKY HOUSE-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей-квартира И.И. Бродского MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.nimrah.ru/musbrod; pl Iskusstv 3; adult/student R300/100; hnoon-7pm Wed-Sun; mNevsky Prospekt)
This is the former home of Isaak Brodsky, Repin’s favourite student and one of the favoured artists of the revolution (not to be confused with Joseph Brodsky, one of the least-favourite poets of the same regime). Besides being a painter himself, Brodsky was also an avid collector, and his house-museum contains his collection of thousands of works, including lesser-known paintings by top 19th-century artists such as Repin, Levitan and Kramskoy.

Continuing with a tradition of non-Orthodox churches being built on Nevsky pr, the Armenian merchant Ovanes Lazarian paid for the city’s first Armenian church to be erected here in 1771. Designed by German architect Georg Veldten and completed in 1780, the church's intimate interior was destroyed during Soviet times, but has since been restored.
PLOSHCHAD OSTROVSKOGOSQUARE
(Площадь Островского MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mGostiny Dvor)
Created by Carlo Rossi in the 1820s and 1830s, this square is named for Alexander Ostrovsky (1823–86), a celebrated 19th-century playwright. An enormous statue of Catherine the Great ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Ostrovskogo) (1873) stands amid the chess, backgammon and mah-jong players who crowd the benches here. At the Empress’ heels are renowned statesmen of the 19th century, including her lovers Orlov, Potemkin and Suvorov.
The most prominent building on the square is Rossi’s neoclassical Alexandrinsky Theatre.
The square’s west side is taken up by the National Library of Russia ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-310 7137; www.nlr.ru; pl Ostrovskogo 1/3; h9am-9pm Mon-Fri, 11am-7pm Sat & Sun; W; mGostiny Dvor).
PLOSHCHAD LOMONOSOVASQUARE
(Площадь Ломоносова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mGostiny Dvor)
Named after the great scientist Mikhail Lomonosov, this small square forms the southwestern end of the Carlo Rossi–designed ensemble and is the best spot from which to admire the ideal symmetrical proportions of ul Zodchego Rossi: the buildings on this street are 22m wide, 22m apart and 220m long.
The Vaganova School of Choreography at No 2 is the Mariinsky Ballet’s training school, where Pavlova, Nijinsky, Nureyev and others learned their art.
From the square you can also admire Most Lomonosova, a stone drawbridge (no longer functioning) dating from 1787 with four Doric pavilions that housed the drawbridge mechanism.
PLOSHCHAD ISKUSSTVSQUARE
(Площадь Искусств MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mNevsky Prospekt)
In the 1820s and 1830s, Carlo Rossi designed Ploshchad Iskusstv (Arts Square), named after the cluster of museums and concert halls that surrounds it, and the lovely Mikhailovskaya ul, which joins the square to Nevsky pr. There is invariably a pigeon perched atop the statue of Pushkin ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Iskusstv), erected in 1957, which stands in the middle of the tree-lined square.
VORONTSOV PALACEHISTORIC BUILDING
(Воронцовский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Sadovaya ul 26; mGostiny Dvor)
Opposite Gostiny Dvor, this palace (1749–57) is another noble town house by Rastrelli. From 1810 it was the most elite military school in the empire and is still used as a military school for young cadets. The palace is occasionally opened for concerts and such, details of which are posted out the front.
ANICHKOV PALACEPALACE
(Аничков дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 9555; www.anichkov.ru; Nevsky pr 39a; mGostiny Dvor)
Built between 1741 and 1751, with input from a slew of architects, including Rastrelli and Rossi, the Anichkov Palace is now officially known as the St Petersburg City Palace of Youth Creativity. It's the location for over 1000 hobby classes and after-school clubs for the city's children. There’s a small museum inside, but it is only open sporadically for tours.
The palace was twice a generous gift for services rendered: Empress Elizabeth gave it to her favourite Count Razumovsky and later Catherine the Great presented it to Potemkin. This was also Tsar Nicholas II’s favourite place to stay in St Petersburg – he far preferred the cosy interiors to the vastness of the Winter Palace.

For an idealised view of what parts of St Petersburg looked like back in the early 18th century, this interactive model village is a small revelation. The scaled models of the Peter and Paul Fortress, Vasilyevsky Island, Peterhof, Oranienbaum etc are incredibly detailed with moving horse and carriages and sailing ships.
The ensemble is laid out to reflect the four seasons and lit for both night and day. You'll find it on the 6th floor above the metro entrance.
CHURCH OF THE SAVIOUR NOT MADE BY HUMAN HANDSQUARE

Giving new meaning to 'back in the USSR', this 'museum' is sure to be one of the most entertaining ones you will visit in St Petersburg. Admission includes a stack of 15 kopek coins used to operate the 50-odd game machines in its collection, which date to the Brezhnev era.
Have great fun joining local kids and their nostalgic parents as they play games such as Morskoi Boi (Battleships), table ice hockey and Repka, based on a Russian fable about pulling a giant radish out of the ground!
There's a pleasant cafe here too and at least once a month they host late-night DJ parties when ping-pong tables are rolled out to add to the fun.

TOP SIGHT
FABERGÉ MUSEUM
The magnificently restored Shuvalovsky Palace is home to the world's largest collection of pieces manufactured by the jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé (including nine Imperial Easter eggs) and fellow master craftspeople of pre-revolutionary Russia.
Fabergé founded his jewellery business in St Petersburg in 1842. At its height he employed 700 people across many factories and in four shops in Russia and one in London. The tradition of tsars giving their wives jewelled Easter eggs began in 1885 when Alexander III commissioned the 37-year-old Fabergé to create a present for his Danish wife Maria Feodorovna. From 1897, the new tsar Nicholas II asked the jeweller to continue making the eggs for his mother, now the Dowager Empress, and his own wife Alexandra Feodorovna.
As dazzling as these brilliant baubles are, they are just a prelude to a series of other lavishly decorated halls in which thousands of other pieces are displayed, including silver tea services, enamelled and jewelled cigarette cases and belt buckles, jade bowls and Russian Impressionist paintings. Look out for pieces by Fyodor Rückert, whose cloisonné enamel work is highly distinctive and beautiful.

Like its sibling restaurant Chekov, Gogol whisks diners back to the genteel days of pre-revolutionary Russian home dining.

Cococo has charmed locals with its inventive approach to contemporary Russian cuisine. Your food is likely to arrive disguised as, say, a small bird's egg, a can of peas or a broken flowerpot – all rather gimmicky, theatrical and fun. The best way to sample what it does is with its tasting menu (R2900). Bookings are advised.
Every Thursday at 7pm the chef pushes out the boundaries with a special 10-course tasting menu (R5000). If that all sounds too much, consider popping in here for a pleasant breakfast: the space doubles as the in-house restaurant of the W Hotel.

Approach the magnificent 1Palace Square on Dvortsovaya pl, from Bolshaya Morskaya ul. Turning the corner from Nevsky pr, behold the 2Alexander Column, perfectly framed under the triumphal arch with the 3Winter Palace as its elaborate backdrop. Turn right at the square's northeast corner to find the colossal 4Atlantes holding aloft the portico of the New Hermitage.
At the Moyka River, cross to the eastern bank using either span of the 5Pevchesky Most. Head north along the river to the final residence of Russia’s most celebrated poet and now the 6Pushkin Flat-Museum. Around the corner, Konyushennaya pl is dominated by the 18th-century court stables, currently under restoration. In the middle of the complex you can visit the 7Church of the Saviour Not Made by Human Hand where Pushkin's funeral service was held.
Rest for a while in either the 8Mars Field, the former imperial guard parade grounds back over the Moyka River, or in the shady canal-side 9Mikhailovsky Gardens. Revived, you'll now be ready for the spectacular aChurch on the Spilled Blood. There's a spetacular view of the church from bTeatralny most near the intersection of the Moyka and Griboyedov Canal.
Detour off nab kanala Griboyedova to find a statue of Pushkin in the middle of pretty cpl Iskusstv. The square is ringed by celebrated cultural institutions, including the dRussian Museum and eMikhailovsky Theatre.

Head up Dumskaya ul to return to Nevsky pr and navigate your way along the exterior vaulted gallery surrounding the iBolshoy Gostiny Dvor, the 18th-century trading arcade still serving shoppers. A short walk east along Nevsky pr is Ploshchad Ostrovskogo, a small park with an impressive jstatue of Catherine the Great and a view the impressive facade of the kAlexandrinsky Theatre.

The antithesis of the nearby dive bars, Apotheke is a calm, cosy cocoon for cocktail connoisseurs. Its slogan is 'think what you drink', so there's no official menu but a friendly young bartender, most likely in a white jacket and sporting a hipster moustache, to make suggestions or simply surprise you.

Boroda means beard in Russian, and sure enough you'll see plenty of facial hair and tattoos in this hipster cocktail hang-out. Never mind, as the mixologists really know their stuff – we can particularly recommend their smoked Old Fashioned, which is infused with tobacco smoke, and their colourful (and potent) range of shots.

Gran is a great little neighbourhood cafe that prepares excellent cups by your brew method of choice – Aeropress, Chemex or Hario pour-overs. Of course, if you prefer just a latte or a flat white, the baristas here have you covered. It's a small, raw space with flowers and touches of artwork softening the brick and concrete.
Coffees aside, Gran has waffles, granola and other breakfast fare (served til 4pm), plus panini, bagel sandwiches and desserts.

'Abandon hope all ye who enter here,' warns the sign on the door – and it's putting no one off cramming into this popular club that occupies a former chapel in the courtyard area south of the square. In warmer months patrons linger outside where there's a greasy burger bar to help soak up the alcoholic excesses.
KOFE NA KUKHNECAFE
(Кофе на Кухне MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/morecoffee; nab reki Fontanki 13; h8.30am-10pm Mon-Fri, 10am-11pm Sat & Sun; W; mGostiny Dvor)

It's a happening bar, it serves a mean burger and there's a hairdresser at the back – should you fancy a new 'do' part-way through the night. Oh, and there's a fussball table, if conversation lags and you fancy a bit of hand-twisting action.
CAFE-BAR PRODUCKTYCAFE

GOLUBAYA USTRITSAGAY
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-921-332 5161; www.boyster.ru; ul Lomonosova 1; h7pm-6am; mGostiny Dvor)
Loud, lewd and lots of fun, this is the coolest gay place in town. Take your pick from the main bar, where the uninhibited crowd is often quite literally hanging from the rafters, the Priscilla Queen of the Desert karaoke bar, or the other upstairs bars and dancefloors.
Meaning Blue Oyster, the bar is named after the leather bar that featured in the 1980s Police Academy movies, but is as unlike it as vinyl is to velvet.
BERMUDY BAR DISCOBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/bar_bermudy; Bankovsky per 6; h6pm-6am; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Resurrecting the time-honoured St Petersburg practice of dancing on the tables, this friendly bar does indeed become more of a disco than a bar after midnight. With low prices, good cocktails, table football and a trashy, fun atmosphere, Bermudy is an anything-goes destination if you want a late night.
W TERRACEBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-610 6155; www.wstpetersburg.com; W Hotel, Voznesensky pr 6; hnoon-1am Sun-Thu, noon-2am Fri & Sat May-Sep; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)

Huge, with several bars and dance floors, as well as a men-only dark room, this is a stalwart of the St Petersburg gay scene. There are events on throughout the week. Music is mainly at the pop and house end of the spectrum and there's usually plenty of topless eye-candy gyrating at weekends.
WARSZAWABAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/warszawabufet; Kazanskaya ul 11; h10am-2am Sun-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; mNevsky Prospekt)
Russian urbanites have always harboured a special admiration for the quaint provincialism of Eastern Europe, hence this smallish bar with old-fashioned wallpaper, vintage furniture and portraits of 20th-century Polish film stars. Polish beer is on tap and cocktails are based on liquors you may have never heard of. Good for deep, vodka-infused philosophical conversations.
DACHABAR
(Дача MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/bardacha; Dumskaya ul 9; h6pm-6am; mGostiny Dvor)
This is the joint that kicked off the whole Dumskaya dive-bar scene in 2004. We'd say it's showing its age, but truth is that it was never about keeping up appearances here – just drinking and dancing the night through in a packed-to-the-gills space.
FIDELCLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/barfidel; Dumskaya ul 9; h6pm-6am; mGostiny Dvor)
This long-running dive bar is a sort of musical and alcoholic tribute to the ruler who 'outlived six presidents of America and six leaders of the Soviet Union and Russia'.
WITNESS TO HISTORY

Palace Square has been the location for some of the most dramatic moments in St Petersburg's history. On Bloody Sunday (9 January 1905), tsarist troops fired on workers who were peaceably gathered in the square, sparking the 1905 revolution. And it was across Dvortsovaya pl that the storming of the Winter Palace took place during the 1917 October Revolution, an event re-enacted by Lenin and thousands of Red Guards in 1920 and later filmed in 1927 for Sergei Eisenstein's October, commissioned by the government to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.

It’s generally easier and cheaper to get tickets to the performances staged here than those at the Mariinsky.
oALEXANDRINSKY THEATRETHEATRE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-710 4103; www.alexandrinsky.ru; pl Ostrovskogo 2; tickets R900-6000; mGostiny Dvor)
This magnificent venue is just one part of an immaculate architectural ensemble designed by Carlo Rossi. The theatre’s interior oozes 19th-century elegance and style, and it’s worth taking a peek even if you don’t see a production here.
This is where Anton Chekhov premiered The Seagull in 1896; the play was so badly received on opening that the playwright fled to wander anonymously among the crowds on Nevsky pr. Chekhov is now a beloved part of the theatre's huge repertoire, ranging from Russian folktales to Shakespearean tragedies.
Head through the archway in the southwest corner of the square to find the Alexanderinsky's New Stage.
NEW STAGEPERFORMING ARTS
(Новая сцена MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-401 5341; http://alexandrinsky.ru; nab reki Fontanki 49a; mGostiny Dvor)
The New Stage at Alexandrinsky, which opened in 2013, is a strikingly modern building for the historic city center but one that keeps a low profile due to the architect's ingenious use of glass and a secluded courtyard space. Come here to see contemporary dance, music, film, lectures and other events.
The theatre's roof is also one of the venues for the summer programme of screenings organised by Roof Cinema.

Dating back to 1929, this theatre, as its name implies, specialises in musical and comedic plays and performances. Over the White Nights tourist season you'll likely find Swan Lake on here. At other times check it out for its high-quality musical productions.
HERMITAGE THEATREBALLET
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-408 1084; https://hermitagetheater.com; Dvortsovaya nab 32; online tickets from R8300; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Designed by Giacomo Quarenghi, this intimate neoclassical auditorium was once the private theatre of the imperial family, and stands on the site of the original Winter Palace of Peter I. Book early if you’d like to see a ballet (usually classics such as Swan Lake and Giselle) at a discount, but still be prepared to pay well over the odds compared to other theatres in the city.
Access to the theatre is via an entrance to the Large (Old) Hermitage on Dvortsovaya nab; look for the door on the southwest side of the stone bridge over the small water channel.
BOLSHOI ST PETERSBURG STATE CIRCUSCIRCUS

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 5614; www.domkino.spb.ru; Karavannaya ul 12; htickets from R100; mGostiny Dvor)
One of the handful of cinemas in the city where you can see foreign films and some higher-brow Hollywood productions with subtitles, as well as arty Russian movies. It is also where the British Council holds its British Film Festival. Despite a refit, the whole place remains remarkably Soviet in a charming way.
The cinemas are small so book ahead or get here early if there's a film you particularly want to see. In the same building is Rodina, another classy cinema with two screens.
AVRORACINEMA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-315-52-54; www.avrora.spb.ru; Nevsky pr 60; tickets R300-700; mGostiny Dvor)
Opening in 1913 as the Piccadilly Picture House, this was the city’s most fashionable cinema in the early years of Russian film, and it has retained its position pretty consistently ever since. Today most premieres (to which you can nearly always buy tickets) take place here. Foreign films are dubbed into Russian, though sometimes you’ll find the odd subtitled one.
Renamed the more Soviet-sounding Avrora in 1932, it was here that a young Dmitry Shostakovich played piano accompaniment to silent movies.
GLINKA CAPELLA HOUSECLASSICAL MUSIC
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 1058; www.glinka-capella.ru; nab reki Moyki 20; mAdmiralteyskaya)

(Приют комедианта MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-310 3277; www.pkteatr.ru; Sadovaya ul 27/9; htickets R600-1800; mSennaya Ploshchad)
This delightful theatre’s name means ‘the actor’s shelter’ and it does a pretty good job of fulfilling its role, providing refuge for some of the city’s best up-and-coming actors, directors and producers. It was founded by actor Yury Tomashevsky in the late 1980s, when the city turned over a defunct cinema that the group still uses.
Productions are in Russian.

Named after Vera Komissarzhevskaya, a great actress who gained her reputation as leading lady in Vsevolod Meyerhold performances during the late 19th century, this theatre is known for its modern treatment of classic plays. Productions are in Russian.
MONUMENT TO ALEXANDER III

‘I don’t care about politics. I simply depicted one animal on another,’ said sculptor Paolo Trubetskoy defending his equestrian statue of Alexander III when it was unveiled in 1909. Originally erected on pl Vosstaniya, the unflattering giant bronze of the stout, unpopular tsar had caused a scandal among St Petersburg society who were divided on its artistic merits. Alexander's son Nicholas II considered shipping it off to Irkutsk, but when rumours started that he wanted to send his dad into Siberian exile, he changed his mind.
In 1937 the statue was removed from pl Vosstaniya and sent to languish in an interior courtyard of the Russian Museum. In post-communist Russia, when the Marble Palace ceased to house the Lenin Museum, the statue was moved to the forecourt there, replacing Lenin's armoured car (which now can be seen at the Artillery Museum).

This glorious Style Moderne building is now dubbed Au Pont Rouge after the Krasny most (Red Bridge) it stands beside. Inside you'll find choice fashions and accessories and top-notch souvenirs.
The restoration included the rebuilding of the glass cupola, destroyed in the 1930s so as not to clutter the view towards the Admiralty down Gorokhovaya ul. On the ground floor there's a branch of the French cafe Patisserie Garçon.
oTAIGAFASHION & ACCESSORIES
(Тайга MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://taiga.space; Dvortsovaya nab 20; h1-9pm; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Like several other of the city's trendy hangouts, Taiga keeps a low profile despite its prime location close by the Hermitage. The warren of small rooms in the ancient building are worth exploring to find cool businesses ranging from a barber to fashion and books. 8 Store is one of the best, a stylish boutique stacked with clothes and accessories by local designers.
Also great for original design gifts and souvenirs is Imenno Lavka.
TYKVAFASHION & ACCESSORIES

Not in the same sprawling, raggedy league as other St Petersburg creative clusters, Maker is really one big shop selling mainly locally designed clothes and accessories, aimed at 'normal people' by which it means its prices are not out of this stratosphere. There's a cafe and a beauty salon here, too.
21 SHOPFASHION & ACCESSORIES
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://21-shop.ru; Bolshaya Konyushennaya ul 19/8; h11am-8pm; mNevsky Prospekt)

Next to the cafe-bar of the same name, this is one of the best second-hand fashion stores in the city – it has a good eye for quality labels and a stylish look, but consequently you'll pay more than the average for the goods.
UNTSIYATEA
(Унция MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-325 5800; www.chay.info; Nevsky pr 5; h10am-9pm; mAdmiralteyskaya)

In a city with men in uniform on every street corner, this is where you can get yours (the uniform that is!). Buy stripey sailor tops, embroidered badges, big boots, camouflage jackets and snappy caps at decent prices. Look for the circular green and gold sign with ‘Military Shop’ written in English; the entrance is in the courtyard.
YAKHONTJEWELLERY
(Яхонт MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 6415; www.juvelirtorg.spb.ru; Bolshaya Morskaya ul 24; h10am-8pm; mAdmiralteyskaya)
From this building, Carl Fabergé dazzled the imperial family and the rest of the world with his extraordinary bespoke designs. Yakhont has no link to the Fabergé family, but it is carrying on the tradition anyway. This long, dark salon provides an impressive showcase of the work.
STARAYA KNIGABOOKS
(Старая книга MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-315 1151; http://staraya-kniga.ru; Nevsky pr 3; h10am-7pm; mAdmiralteyskaya)
This long-established antique bookseller is a fascinating place to rummage around. The stock ranges from fancy, mint-edition books to second-hand, well-worn Soviet editions, maps and art (in the section next to the art-supplies shop).

APRAKSIN DVORMARKET
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-310 5608; http://apraksinmarket.ru/; Sadovaya ul 30; h10am-7pm; mGostiny Dvor)
There's been a market here since the 18th century. Although parts of it are being upgraded, it remains mostly a gritty and chaotic Dostoevsky-style warren of stalls offering mainly cheap clothes, shoes and leather goods, as well as food and snacks beloved by the multiethnic traders who work here.
If you're hungry look for Chufalnya ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Korpus 27, Apraksin Dvor, Sadovaya ul 30 (enter from Apraksin per); mains R240-360; h10am-10pm; mSennaya Ploshchad), a Chinese grocery and cafe on the upper floor of the Korpus 27 block.

Nikolai Gogol described it as 'Petersburg's universal channel of communication' in his story Nevsky Prospekt. Some 300 years on from its creation, little has changed. Nevsky remains the city's most famous street, running 4.7km from the Admiralty to the Alexandr Nevsky Monastery, from which it takes its name. Taking a stroll along it is an essential St Petersburg experience and particularly special at dusk as the low light casts shadows and picks out silhouettes from the elegant mix of architecture.
The inner 2.5km to Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal) is the city's prime shopping drag that pulses with street life. Here you'll find baroque palaces, churches in a range of denominations, all manner of entertainments and, above all, shops, some historic in their own right. These are the key ones not to miss:
ASinger Building ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 28; mNevsky Prospekt) The former headquarters of the Singer sewing machine company, which opened a factory in the Russian capital in 1904, is one of St Petersburg’s most gorgeous buildings. Its Style Modern architecture, designed by Pavel Suzor, and topped with a glass tower and scuplture, also housed the American consulate for a few years prior to WWI. It's possible to access the offices part of the building including the interior of the glass dome on a tour (R6000 for up to three people) organised with Placemates.
ABolshoy Gostiny Dvor (Большой Гостиный Двор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-630 5408; http://bgd.ru; Nevsky pr 35; h10am-10pm; mGostiny Dvor) One of the world’s first indoor shopping malls, the ‘Big Merchant Yard’ dates from between 1757 and 1785 and stretches 230m along Nevsky pr (its perimeter is more than 1km long). This Rastrelli creation is not as elaborate as some of his other work, finished as it was by Vallin de la Mothe in a more sober neoclassical style. At its height at the turn of the 20th century, Gostiny Dvor contained over 170 shops.
APassage (Пассаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-313 7400; http://passage.spb.ru; Nevsky pr 48; h10am-9pm; mGostiny Dvor) Built between 1846 and 1848, this arcade has a glass roof spanning the entire block from Nevsky to Italiyanskaya ul. Dostoevsky wrote a story about a man who was swallowed by a crocodile in Passage, after a live crocodile was exhibited here in 1864. Look for the small exhibition on the 1st floor with historical photos and other items related to the arcade. The handsomely restored ground floor has several good souvenir and antique shops.
AKupetz Eliseevs ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-456 6666; www.kupetzeliseevs.ru; Nevsky pr 56; h10am-11pm; W; mGostiny Dvor) This Style Moderne stunner is St Petersburg's most elegant grocery store. Built in 1904 as the flagship of the Eliseev Brothers' highly successful chain of food emporiums, little expense or design flourish was spared in its construction. In recent years the building has been restored to its full grandeur with huge plate-glass windows providing glimpses into a dazzling interior of stained glass, chandeliers, polished brass and a giant pineapple palm. The building's exterior is no less lavish, graced with four allegorical sculptures representing industry, trade and commerce, art and science. The building also included a theatre, which is still functioning.

History of the Hermitage
When, in 1764, Catherine the Great purchased the art collection of Johann Gotzkowski, which contained a large number of works by Rubens, Rembrandt and Van Dyck, little did anyone suspect that this would form the basis of one of the world’s most celebrated art museums, the repository of millions of artistic masterpieces from around the world.
A New Winter Palace
Some 30 years earlier, it was Empress Anna who engaged a young Bartolomeo Rastrelli to incorporate the existing royal buildings on the Neva into a proper palace. Her successor, the ever-extravagant Empress Elizabeth, wanted something grander so in 1754 she signed a decree ordering the creation of a winter palace, closely supervising its design and construction. Her inopportune death in 1761 occurred only a few months before the Winter Palace was finally completed, but her legacy has been confirmed by what is arguably St Petersburg’s most strikingly beautiful palace.
Visitors and residents were wowed by the capital’s newest addition: ‘visible from a distance, rising above the rooftops, the upper storey of the new Winter Palace, adorned with a host of statues’, as it was described by one 18th-century visitor to the capital. But the palace, of course, was a private residence. After the death of Empress Elizabeth, Peter III lived here for only three months before he was overthrown in a palace coup and replaced by Catherine the Great. This grand baroque building thenceforth became the official residence of the imperial family.
The Imperial Art Collection
Collecting art was an obsession for Catherine, who purchased some of the most extensive private collections in Europe, including those of Heinrich von Brühl, Lord Robert Walpole and Baron Pierre Crozat. By 1774 Catherine’s collection included over 2000 paintings, and by the time of her death in 1796 that number had doubled.
Catherine and her successors didn’t much care for Rastrelli’s baroque interiors and had most of the rooms completely remodelled in classical style. To display her art, Catherine first had built the Small Hermitage and later the so-called Old Hermitage, and allowed prominent people to privately visit the collection on application. In the 1780s Giacomo Quarenghi added the Hermitage Theatre, which served as the private theatre for the imperial family; it is still used today although now for public performances.
The early 19th century saw the expansion of the collection, particularly in the field of classical antiquity, due both to the continued acquisition of other collections and rich finds being discovered in southern Russia. More acquisitions followed Russia’s victory over Napoleon in 1812 and included the private collection of Napoleon’s consort, Joséphine de Beauharnais.
In December 1837 a devastating fire broke out in the heating shaft of the Field Marshals’ Hall; it burned for over 30 hours and destroyed a large portion of the interior. Most of the imperial belongings were saved, thrown out of windows or dragged outside to sit in the snow. Nicholas I vowed to restore the palace as quickly as possible, employing architect Vasily Stasov and thousands of workers to toil around the clock. Their efforts were not in vain, as the project was completed in a little over a year. Most of the classical interiors in the ceremonial rooms that we see today, including the Grand Hall, the Throne Room and the Armorial Hall, were designed by Stasov.

Russia’s First Public Art Museum
While Peter the Great opened the Kunstkamera, his private collection of curiosities, to the public in the early 18th century, it was Nicholas I who eventually opened the first public art museum in Russia. During a visit to Germany in 1838 he was impressed by the museums he saw in Munich – specifically, by the idea of buildings that were architectural masterpieces in themselves, designed specifically to house and preserve artistic masterpieces. He employed German architect Leo von Klenze and local boy Vasily Stasov to carry out such a project in the proximity of the Winter Palace. The result was the ‘neo-Grecian’ New Hermitage, adorned by statues and bas-reliefs depicting great artists, writers and other cultural figures. After 11 years of work, the museum was opened to the public in 1852.
At this time, the first director of the Hermitage was appointed and the collection as a museum, rather than the tsar’s private gallery, began to take shape. Various further acquisitions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries meant that the Hermitage had truly arrived as a world-class museum. Particularly important caches of paintings included the two Leonardo da Vinci Madonnas (acquired in 1865 and 1914), Piotr Semionov-Tien-Shansky’s enormous collection of Dutch and Flemish art, purchased in 1910, and the Stroganov collection of Italian old masters.

Expanding the Collection
It was the postrevolutionary period that saw a threefold increase in the Hermitage’s collection. In 1917 the Winter Palace and the Hermitage were declared state museums, and throughout the 1920s and 1930s the Soviet state seized and nationalised countless valuable private collections, including those of the Stroganovs, Sheremetyevs, Shuvalovs, Yusupovs and Baron Stieglitz. In 1948 it incorporated the renowned collections of post-Impressionist and Impressionist paintings of Moscow industrialists Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov, including works by Matisse and Picasso.
During WWII, Soviet troops in Germany and Eastern Europe appropriated enormous numbers of paintings that had belonged to private collectors. In 1995, after years of keeping the paintings in storage, the Hermitage finally put these works, including those by Monet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Picasso and Matisse, on public display. In recent years, the museum has been building a collection of contemporary art that currently numbers around 1500 pieces, some of which are displayed in the General Staff Building – a tiny fraction of the three million items listed in the Hermitage’s inventory.

St Petersburg’s Bridges
A city threaded with canals and rivers needs bridges. St Petersburg has made a virtue of this necessity, crafting bridges that are both practical and beautiful to look at. Here are a few of our favourites:

Anichkov most | popova valeriya/shutterstock ©
Anichkov most (Аничков мост)
Named after its engineer and featuring rearing horses at all four corners, the striking ornamentation of this bridge symbolises humanity’s struggle with and taming of nature.
Bankovsky most (Банковский мост)
This charming footbridge is suspended by cables emerging from the mouths of golden-winged griffins. The name comes from the Assignment Bank (now a further-education institute), which stands on one side of the bridge.

Griffin statue, Bankovsky most | win-initiative/Getty Images ©
Lviny most (Львиный мост)
Another suspension footbridge over Griboyedov Canal, this one is supported by pairs of regal lions, hence its name.
Panteleymonovsky most (Пантелеймоновский мост)
At the confluence of the Moyka and the Fontanka, this beauty features lamp posts bedecked with the double-headed eagle and railings adorned with the coat of arms.
1-y Inzhenerny most (Первый Инженерный мост)
While there is no shortage of adornment on the cast-iron bridge leading to Mikhailovsky Castle, the highlight is the Chizhik-Pyzhik, the statue of the little bird that hovers over the Moyka.
Troitsky most (Троицкий мост)
Opened in 1903, this Franco-Russian codesign is a Style Moderne classic. Like most other spans across the Neva it is a drawbridge, raised every evening during the shipping season at designated times to allow the passage of river traffic.

Explore Sennaya & Kolomna
Stretching north and south of the meandering Moyka River, these two neighbourhoods may lack the dense concentration of sights found in the Historic Heart, but are still blessed with some spectacular sights. By day, you can explore the lavish interiors of the Yusupov Palace or bask in the greenery and art-filled spaces of New Holland Island, then return by night for magnificent concerts at one of three performing arts venues under the Mariinsky umbrella.
There’s also much history hidden in these scenic streets. Russophiles can wander the lanes off Sennaya Ploschad, a region where Dostoevesky – and some of his best known characters – lived and roamed, and explore pivotal domestic achievements at the Central Naval Museum and the Railway Museum. There are plenty of lesser known attractions as well, including one of the city’s most photogenic cathedrals and Russia’s most impressive synagogue.
You could spend a few days exploring the area, or simply base yourself here. The district offers proximity to the Historic Heart – with more of a local feel – and plenty of great dining options as well.
Local Life
ACanal Life Sennaya and Kolomna are home to some of the prettiest canals in the city, well away from the crowds. Check out the gorgeous Kryukov Canal, the far ends of the Griboyedov Canal and the Fontanka River.
AFree Concerts Check out the Maly Zal (small hall) at the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory, where you’ll often see fantastic free concerts from students and alumni.

Getting There & Away
AMetro Sennaya is served by the interconnecting Sennaya pl (Line 2), Spasskaya (Line 4) and Sadovaya (Line 5) stations, the city’s biggest interchange, entrances to which are all on Sennaya pl. Kolomna is not served by the metro at all at the time of writing, though an extension to the Mariinsky is planned. Currently the nearest stations are those on Sennaya pl or Admiralteyskaya station in the Historic Heart.
ABus Bus 3 connects the Mariinsky with Nevsky pr via Bolshaya Morskaya ul, while Trolleybus 5 connects pl Truda with Nevsky pr via Konnogvardeysky bul.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
Book ahead of time to see the ballet or opera performance you’re interested in at the Mariinsky Theatre, especially during the White Nights, when performances of popular productions sell out months in advance. You can book and pay for tickets on the website, and then collect them at the box office before the performance, which is much better than trying to find what’s available once you’re in town.

MARIINSKY THEATRE
The Mariinsky Theatre has played a pivotal role in Russian ballet ever since it was built in 1859, and it remains one of Russia's most loved and respected cultural institutions. Its pretty green-and-white main building on aptly named Teatralnaya pl (Theatre Sq) is a must for any visitor wanting to see one of the world's great ballet and opera stages.


brian kinney / shutterstock ©
A Glittering History
The building you see today opened its doors in 1860, and was named in honour of Maria Alexandrovna, the wife of Tsar Alexander II. Since its inception, the Mariinsky has seen some of the world's greatest musicians, dancers and singers on its stage. Petipa choreographed his most famous works here, including Swan Lake and The Nutcracker, and the premieres of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades and Prokofiev's Romeo & Juliet were also held here. The Soviets initially closed the Mariinsky down, but as the renamed Kirov Ballet it became a major force in promoting the Soviet Union abroad, and is still the main reason that ballet and Russia remain synonymous worldwide.
Performance
The best way to experience the building as its designers intended is to see an opera or ballet. Outside performance times you can wander into the theatre’s foyer and maybe peep into the lovely auditorium. As well as the main Mariinsky Theatre, there is also the newer, world-class Mariinsky II next door, a 2000-seat, six-stage theatre that marks the Mariinsky’s arrival in the 21st century.

YUSUPOV PALACE
This spectacular palace on the Moyka River has some of the best 19th-century interiors in the city, in addition to a fascinating and gruesome history. The palace’s last owner was the eccentric Prince Felix Yusupov, a high-society darling and at one time the richest man in Russia. Most notoriously, this palace is where Grigory Rasputin was murdered in 1916.

Amazing Interiors
The palace was built by Vallin de la Mothe in the 1770s, but the current interiors date from a century later, when it became the residence of the illustrious Yusupov family. The palace interiors are sumptuous and rich, with many halls painted in different styles and decked out with gilded chandeliers, silks, frescoes, tapestries and some fantastic furniture. Your visit begins on the 2nd floor, which features an amazing ballroom (the White Column Room), banquet hall, the delightful Green Drawing Room and the ornate rococo private theatre. The tour continues on the ground floor, where you will see the fabulous Turkish Study (used by Felix as a billiards room), the Prince's study and the Moorish Drawing Room, among many other rooms.
The Mad Monk
In 1916 Rasputin was murdered here by Felix Yusupov and some fellow plotters, who considered the Siberian mystic to have become too powerful. To see the room where Rasputin’s murder began (he was poisoned and shot to no avail, finally succumbing to drowning) you have to pay for an extra 90-minute tour, which takes place at 5pm daily.

NEW HOLLAND ISLAND
Closed to the public for much of the past three centuries, New Holland Island has been transformed into a stunning new green space and cultural complex. Come to check out art installations on the grounds, have a meal or a drink in one of the historic brick buildings, and take part in some of the many events happening year-round.


brian kinney / shutterstock ©
Background
In Peter’s time, the complex was used for shipbuilding (its name refers to the place where he learned the trade). The impressive red-brick-and-granite arch, designed by Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe in the late 18th century, is one of the city’s best examples of Russian classicism. In the 19th century, a large basin was built in the middle of the island and experiments were conducted by scientist Alexey Krylov in an attempt to build a boat that couldn’t be capsized. In 1915 the navy built a radio transmitter here – the most powerful in Russia at the time. It was from there that Lenin gave his famous 1917 broadcast, announcing the revolution had begun. During WWII, the island suffered heavy damage during bomb raids and artillery fire. The buildings that did survive fell into ruin in the post-war years, and remained largely derelict until the 21st century.
Buildings & Grounds
Near the entrance to the island, the newly built Pavilion houses temporary exhibitions and is also the place to hear lectures, artist presentations and other events. Around the corner, the handsomely restored Foundry, dating from the mid-19th century, is built on the site that some believe was used as Peter the Great’s original blacksmith shop. Today it houses the casual Volkonsky Deli and the more stylish Kuznya House, a sit-down restaurant that transitions into a late-night lounge with DJs on weekends. In front of the Foundry, a herb garden adds beauty to the setting, with its lavender, dill, thyme, mint and other plants. A small pond at the centre of New Holland invites contemplation (and ice skating in winter). A path skirts the perimeter, while stairs lead down to pontoons, getting you close to the water.
Work continues on New Holland, with 2017 seeing the opening of the Bottle, a brick, three-storey, ring-shaped building dating from the 19th century that has cafes, stores (including an excellent art-minded bookseller) and workshops. An inner courtyard has a small stage with its own line-up of concerts and other events.
Events
There are loads of events happening in New Holland. Outdoor concerts are the big draw in the summer, and past years have brought out top names from SPB’s music scene as well as international artists like Ane Brun from Stockholm and hip-hop trio Digable Planets from Brooklyn. It’s a peaceful place to perfect your sun salutations during yoga sessions on the grass, hone your drawing skills at a sketching class, or work up a sweat during ‘Sports Days’ when trainers give free fitness classes. You can also catch periodic film screenings and lectures on art and architecture.
Hands-on Activities
Aside from lounging on the grass on warm sunny days, the island is a fine spot for a bit of ping pong, pétanque or chess. New Holland even hosts occasional tournaments – all are welcome to join. You can hire out games from the visitor centre. In the winter, there’s also ice skating on the pond.
Playground
A photogenic playground pays homage to New Holland’s shipbuilding days with a model of the Petr and Pavel frigate, built to 80% scale. Stretching 26m long and 6m high, this open wooden structure has rope bridges, platforms, a wooden steering wheel, and a telescope, making it a fantastic setting for kids to explore. Next to it is a smaller playground better suited to younger kids, with swings and slides.

SENNAYA PLOSHCHADSQUARE
(Сенная площадь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Immortalised by Dostoevsky, who lived all over the neighbourhood and set Crime and Punishment here, St Petersburg’s Haymarket was once the city’s filthy underbelly. Indeed, until a much-needed facelift just over a decade ago, the square was overloaded with makeshift kiosks and market stalls, which made it a magnet for the homeless, beggars, pickpockets and drunks. These days, you'll have to look hard to find vestiges of its once insalubrious days.
The peripatetic Dostoevsky, who occupied some 20 residences in his 28-year stay in the city, once spent a couple of days in debtors’ prison in what is now called the Senior Officers’ Barracks, just across the square from the Sennaya pl metro station.
Alyona Ivanovna, the elderly moneylender murdered in Crime and Punishment, lived a few blocks west of here, at nab kanala Griboyedova 104. Her flat would have been No 74, in the courtyard on the 3rd floor.
RAILWAY MUSEUMMUSEUM

This museum near Sennaya pl is a must for train-set fans and modellers. It houses a collection of scale locomotives and model railway bridges, often made by the engineers who built the real ones. The oldest such collection in the world, the museum dates to 1809, 28 years before Russia had its first working train!
Come on weekends for the free Russian-language tours of the museum (held at 11am and 2pm), when guides raise little drawbridges, ring station bells and operate mechanised trains along various tracks in the galleries.
Look out for the fantastic map of Russia hanging above the main museum staircase showing all the train lines in the country, which almost makes up for the total lack of signage in English.
YUSUPOV GARDENSPARK
(Юсуповский сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Sadovaya ul; hsunrise-sunset; mSadovaya)
West of Sennaya pl along Sadovaya ul you’ll find the charming Yusupov Gardens, a pleasant park with a big lake in the middle. The flower-filled grounds are a popular place to stroll, sit and sunbathe. The building set back behind the gardens is the Old Yusupov Palace ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) (not to be confused with the Yusupov Palace on the Moyka River), which is closed to the public and is used mainly for official receptions.

Following a move to this beautifully repurposed building opposite the former shipyard of New Holland, the Central Naval Museum has moved into the 21st century and is now one of St Petersburg's best history museums. The superb, light-bathed building houses an enormous collection of models, paintings and other artefacts from three centuries of Russian naval history, including botik, the small boat known as the 'grandfather of the Russian navy' – stumbling across it in the late 17th century was Peter the Great's inspiration to create a Russian maritime force.
The real attraction here is the superb collection of model boats, some of which are simply extraordinary in size and detail. There's sadly little signage in English, so it's worthwhile paying extra for an audio guide (R600 to R800) if you're interested in really understanding what you're seeing. The entrance to the museum is opposite New Holland on nab Kryukova kanala.
NIKOLSKY CATHEDRALCATHEDRAL
(Никольский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nikolskaya pl 1/3; h9am-7pm; mSadovaya)
Surrounded on two sides by canals, this ice-blue cathedral is one of the most picture-perfect in the city, beloved by locals for its baroque spires and golden domes. It was one of the few churches that still operated during the Soviet era, when organised religion was effectively banned.
Nicknamed the Sailor’s Church (Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors), it contains many 18th-century icons set against rich green columns, and a fine carved wooden iconostasis, though visitors are limited to only a small area of the church’s interior.
A graceful bell tower overlooks the Griboyedov Canal, which is crossed by Staro-Nikolsky most. From this bridge, you can see seven other bridges, more than from any other spot in the city.

This multi-floored gallery near the Griboyedov Canal stages intriguing exhibitions that showcase the talents of Russian artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.

This 19th-century townhouse was the suitably grand childhood home of Vladimir Nabokov, infamous author of Lolita and arguably the most versatile of 20th century Russian writers. Here Nabokov lived with his wealthy family from his birth in 1899 until the revolution in 1917, when they left the country. Nabokov artefacts on display include family photographs, first editions of his books and parts of his extensive butterfly collection.
The house features heavily in Nabokov’s autobiography Speak, Memory, in which he refers to it as a ‘paradise lost’. Indeed, he never returned, dying abroad in 1977. Aside from the various Nabokov artefacts, there's actually relatively little to see of the former home itself, save for some charming interiors (ask to see the gorgeous stained-glass windows in the stairwell, which are not technically part of the museum, but staff may allow you to take a peek).
RUMYANTSEV MANSIONMUSEUM
(Особняк Румянцева MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Angliyskaya nab 44; adult/student R200/100; h11am-6pm Thu-Mon, to 5pm Tue; mAdmiralteyskaya)
History buffs should not miss this oft-overlooked but superb local museum. Part of the State Museum of the History of St Petersburg, the mansion contains an exhibition of 20th-century history, including displays devoted to the 1921 New Economic Policy (NEP), the industrialisation and development of the 1930s, and the Siege of Leningrad during WWII. Exhibitions are unusual in that they depict everyday life in the city during these historic periods. Each room has an explanatory panel in English.
The museum is housed in the majestic 1826 mansion of Count Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantsev, a famous diplomat, politician and statesman, as well as an amateur historian whose personal research library became the basis for the Russian State Library in Moscow. The history of the mansion and its owners is fascinating in itself, and the few restored staterooms at the front of the house suggest daily life for the Rumyantsevs was an opulent affair.
GRAND CHORAL SYNAGOGUESYNAGOGUE
(Большая хоральная синагога MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %921-978 4464; www.eng.jewishpetersburg.ru; Lermontovsky pr 2; h10am-6pm Sun-Fri, services 10am Sat; mSadovaya)
Designed by Vasily Stasov, the striking Grand Choral Synagogue opened in 1893 to provide a central place of worship for St Petersburg’s growing Jewish community. Its lavishness (particularly notable in the 47m-high cupola and the decorative wedding chapel) indicates the pivotal role that Jews played in imperial St Petersburg. The synagogue was fully revamped in 2003. Visitors are welcome except on the Sabbath and other holy days. Men and married women should cover their heads upon entering.
Also on-site are the Small Synagogue (generally opened for guided tours only), the Jewish restaurant Le'chaim and a Kosher Shop. In summer, the synagogue also hosts performances with a Jewish cantor and other musicians performing chaaznut and klezmer music. The synagogue organises English-language tours of the building, as well as Jewish heritage tours of St Petersburg, all of which need to be organised in advance – see the website.
RUSSIAN VODKA MUSEUMMUSEUM

This excellent private museum tells the story of Russia’s national tipple in an interesting and fun way, from the first production of ‘bread wine’ to the phenomenon of the modern international vodka industry, complete with waxwork models and some very cool bottles. You can guide yourself through the exhibit, or be accompanied by an English-speaking guide who’ll liven things up a bit. If you’d like to sample the exhibits, too, take a tasting tour!
There’s an excellent restaurant in the same building, and if you eat there, you can get a discount on museum entry.

MUSEUM OF THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONMUSEUM

Back in the day, this was called the Museum of Atheism; it had a very strong anti-religious bent and was housed in the Kazan Cathedral. Now the name has changed, as has the location, but the fascinating exhibition remains, describing the history of various world religions, including Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity, and taking in everything from Russian icons to Pacific cults and Greek gods. Very little is signed in English, but there is a good-value audio guide.
HOUSE OF MUSICPALACE
(Дом музыки MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-400 1400; www.spdm.ru; nab reki Moyki 211; tours R350; hticket office 11am-6pm Mon-Thu, to 5pm Fri; mSadovaya)
This fabulous and fully restored mansion on the Moyka River belonged to Grand Duke Alexey, the son of Alexander II. The wrought-iron-and-stone fence is one of its most stunning features, with the Grand Duke’s monogram adorning the gates. Tours of the house usually take place once or twice a week, but the dates vary and tickets often sell out in advance, so check the website. Another way to visit the interior is to attend a concert here.
The palace was built in 1895 by Maximilian Messmacher, and each facade represents a different architectural style. The interior is equally diverse, and since renovation has housed the House of Music (Dom Muzyki), where popular classical concerts (R200 to R1000) are regularly held in the building's English Hall. Guided tours are given in Russian and German only.
ST ISIDORE'S CHURCHCHURCH
(Свято-Исидоровская церковь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Rimskogo Korsakova 24; h9am-6.30pm; mSadovaya)
The last great church to have been built in St Petersburg before the revolution, this neo-Byzantine beauty dates from 1907 and creates one of the most gorgeous silhouettes in the entire city, best viewed from the nearby Pikalov Bridge, or the Griboyedov Canal. There's little to see inside, but it's worth a detour to see its onion domes.
MARIINSKY PALACEPALACE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Moyki)
The last neoclassical palace constructed in St Petersburg, the Mariinsky Palace (not to be confused with the theatre) was built between 1839 and 1844. Today it houses the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg, and is closed to the public.
ALEXANDER BLOK HOUSE-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей-квартира Блока MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; ul Dekabristov 57; adult/student R150/100; h11am-6pm Thu-Mon, to 5pm Tue; mSadovaya)
This museum occupies the flat where poet Alexander Blok spent the last eight years of his life (1912–20). The 4th-floor apartment has been preserved much as it was when Blok lived here with his wife Lyubov (daughter of chemist and inventor Mendeleev). When the poet fell ill in 1920, his family moved into the 2nd-floor apartment where he died a year later. An exhibition demonstrates the influence of Blok’s work, as well as some original copies of his poems; signage in Russian only.
The revolutionary Blok believed that individualism had caused a decline in society’s ethics, a situation that would only be rectified by the communist revolution he lived to see, though he died before he could become truly disillusioned with post-revolutionary Russia. The room where Blok died contains his death mask and a drawing of Blok on his deathbed, sketched on the last page of the poet’s pad. Chamber concerts and poetry readings occasionally take place here; ask downstairs for the schedule.
POPOV COMMUNICATIONS MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей связи Попова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.rustelecom-museum.ru; Pochtamtsky per 4; adult/student R200/100; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sat; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Housed in the fabulous 18th-century palace of Chancellor Bezborodko, this museum of communications is the perfect addition to Pochtamtskaya ul (Post Office St). It is named for Professor Alexander Popov, inventor of the radio, and it covers all manner of communication, from the Pony Express to the modern era.
Exhibits are interactive and interesting, including an antique telephone switchboard that still works, the first civil communications satellite, Luch-15, which occupies a prominent place in the atrium, and plenty of multimedia explanations of how things work. Stamp collectors will have a field day admiring the national philatelic collection.
DOSTOEVSKY'S DOMAIN

Dostoevsky lived all over this area; he resided in three flats on tiny Kaznacheyskaya ul alone. From 1861 to 1863, he lived at No 1. In 1864, he spent one month living in the faded red building at No 9, before moving to No 7. Here, he lived from 1864 to 1867 and wrote Crime and Punishment; indeed, the route taken by the novel’s antihero Raskolnikov to murder the old moneylender passed directly under his window.
Speaking of Crime and Punishment, one of the most infamous addresses in the neighbourhood is an innocuous house on the corner of Stolyarny per (called ‘S… lane’ in the book). Known as the Raskolnikov House, it's one of two possible locations of the attic apartment of Dostoevsky's troubled protagonist. Those who claim this is the place go further, saying that Rodion retrieved the murder weapon from a street-sweeper’s storage bin inside the tunnel leading to the courtyard.
The house, not open to the public, is marked by a sculpture of Dostoevsky. The inscription says something to the effect of ‘The tragic fate of the people of this area of St Petersburg formed the foundation of Dostoevsky’s passionate sermon of goodness for all mankind’. Other Dostoevsky connoisseurs argue that it would be more appropriate if Raskolnikov’s attic apartment was located further down the street at No 9, which is otherwise unmarked.

CO-OP GARAGEPIZZA$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cooperativegarage.com; Gorokhovaya 47; pizzas R260-390; hnoon-midnight Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri & Sat; Wv)
Tucked into an unmarked courtyard off Gorokhovaya, this sprawling restaurant and drinking den is the go-to spot for creatively topped thin-crust pizzas and craft beers. The industrial setting draws a chatty crowd of tatted-up hipsters and style mavens, with a mostly rock soundtrack playing in the background. On warm days you can take a table in the courtyard.
There's also a small take-out window opposite the pizza spot, where you can get tasty wok-fried noodles and draught beer.
JULIA CHILD BISTROINTERNATIONAL$

This neighbourhood charmer is a fine anytime spot, with good coffees, teas and snacks, plus creative thoughtfully prepared dishes like kasha (porridge) with mushrooms and feta for breakfast, or halibut with lemon cabbage and celery mousse later in the day. Kindly staff and a laid-back setting will make you want to stick around for a while.
Despite the name, there isn't much of a Julia Child connection – aside perhaps from the emphasis on quality ingredients and an interior that vaguely resembles the cookbook virtuoso's studio kitchen.
TESTOITALIAN$
(Тесто MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.testogastronomica.ru; per Grivtsova 5/29; mains R310-550; h11am-11pm; Wv; mSennaya Ploshchad)
This pleasant little place is good value and yet takes Italian cookery very seriously. Choose from a wide range of homemade pastas and top them with your favourite sauce, whether tomato-based bolognese or a rich, creamy salmon sauce. A few options for soup, salad and pizza round out the menu, but the pasta is the main focus.

This sparkling, friendly and capacious offering right on the Haymarket is a major draw for diners at all hours. Like many other Ginza restaurants, Khochu Kharchu has a fully photographic menu of delicious comfort food, focused on Mingrelian (West Georgian) cooking. Come for calorific khachapuri (cheese-stuffed bread), khinkali (dumplings), and of course the eponymous kharcho, a beef, rice, tomato and walnut soup.

Headed by a chef from New Delhi, this attractive eatery, decorated with colourful metal lamps and strung with prayer flags, serves up some of the best Indian cooking in the city. You'll find filling and satisfying curries, tandoors and a delicious selection of vegetarian options – all go nicely with piping hot naan (flatbread).
Service can be slow, so order some papadums or samosas, and sip that mango lassi slowly while you wait.

An old-fashioned elegance prevails at Severyanin, one of the top choices for Russian cuisine near Sennaya pl. Amid vintage wallpaper, mirrored armoires and tasselled lampshades, you might feel like you've stepped back a few decades. Start off with the excellent mushroom soup or borsch (beetroot soup), before moving on to rabbit ragout in puff pastry or Baltic flounder with wine sauce.
Excellent but friendly service and fair prices.
KARAVANCENTRAL ASIAN$$
(Караван MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Voznesensky pr 46; mains R420-790; h10am-1am; v; mSadovaya)
Despite the somewhat kitschy decor, Karavan is a superb Central Asian restaurant with a lovely location overlooking the Fontanka River. Open grills line the dining room, giving an optimum view (and scent) of the kebabs that are on the menu. Meat aside, there's also satisfying vareniki (dumplings), mushroom soup and rich Adjarian khachapuri (cheese bread topped with egg).
You'll also find good Georgian wines on hand and Weihenstephaner on tap.

Combining a love of bicycles and street food from around the globe, Kafe and Bikes serves up delicious cooking amid upbeat grooves, exposed bulbs and those slate grey walls so prevalent in St Petersburg. Shawarmas (grilled meat and salad wrapped in flat bread), wok-fried buckwheat noodles with vegetables, pizzas, khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread) and syrniki (sweet cheese fritters) are all served up in a hurry by friendly staff.
Don't miss the pedal-powered blender in the corner – a fine way to get in a workout while making your own smoothie. You can also hire a bicycle here (per hour from R150).

DEDUSHKA KHOSOUP$

When the weather sours, retreat to this snug, casual spot just west of Nikolsky Cathedral for warming bowls of pho (Vietnamese noodle soup) topped with veal, and shrimp-filled tom yum (spicy soup with lemongrass).
The soups are filling and served up in a hurry, but if you're famished throw in an order of summer rolls (filled with shrimp, chicken and vegetables).

This much-feted, eclectic and original restaurant has got it all just right. The venue itself is a lot of fun to nose around, with multiple small rooms, nooks and crannies. Service is friendly and fast (when it’s not too busy) and the peppy, inventive Italian-leaning menu has something for everyone. Reservations are usually required, so call ahead.
The restaurant is full of unexpected props, from table football to a child’s playroom. Dishes come from all over the world and there are plenty of vegetarian choices, as well as breakfasts served until noon (1pm on weekends).
KUZNYA HOUSEINTERNATIONAL$$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/kuznyahouse; nab Admiralteyskogo kanala; mains R450-890; hnoon-11pm Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat; Wv)
Set in the atmospheric Foundry building, Kuznya House has a creative menu that hopscotches around the globe, with tasty dishes like salmon ceviche with fennel, tandoori chicken, and mussels with frites. It's a stylish but easygoing spot for a meal or a drink, and it transforms into a lounge spot on weekends when DJs spin until the early hours.
Breakfast is served from noon to 2pm (till 4pm on weekends).

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-903 2373; www.sadko-rst.ru; ul Glinki 2; mains R540-1200; hnoon-1am; c; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Serving all the Russian favourites, this impressive restaurant’s decor combines traditional Zhostovo floral designs and Murano glass chandeliers amid vaulted ceilings and elegantly set tables. It’s popular with theatregoers (reserve ahead in the high season), as it’s an obvious pre- or post-Mariinsky dining option.
The waiters, all music students at the nearby Conservatory, give 'impromptu' vocal performances (usually Thursday to Sunday nights around 7pm).
There’s a great children’s room and a full children’s menu to boot, so families are very well catered for.

This smart, funky but informal restaurant offers an international selection of food focused mainly on Modern European cooking, with sections of the menu devoted to Josper, pasta and Asian food, among others. The dishes are prepared in the glass-walled kitchen and are all beautifully presented, while the art direction budget attracts a young and chic crowd.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-992 4220; Nikolskaya pl 5; sandwiches R320-480, mains R490-960; h11am-midnight; W; mSadovaya)
Charming Entrée comes in two parts: the cafe-cum-deli to the right has a chessboard floor, rustic decor, delicious éclairs and sandwiches and, for some reason, Michael Douglas’ signature scrawled on the wall. Behind the curtain is a more formal restaurant with a European menu (duck confit, risotto with wild mushrooms) and a sizeable wine list.
Service could be a little friendlier, but otherwise this place is a great find in a rather desolate stretch of the city centre. Breakfast is served all day.

This stylish Italian-run restaurant on one side of the charming Kryukov Canal offers a full menu of traditional Italian cooking, from its large meat selection to main courses such as grilled salmon with red caviar, cherry tomatoes and fennel. Ask for the pizza menu (R360 to R740), as it's separate to the main one. Breakfast is served daily until noon.

Something of an expat favourite, the Idiot is a charming place that has been serving up high-quality Russian fare for years now. The friendly basement location is all about atmosphere, relaxation and fun (encouraged by the complimentary vodka coming with each meal). You can't go wrong here, whether opting for bliny (wheat pancakes) with caviar, grilled trout or pelmeni (Russian-style ravioli) with mushrooms and sour cream.
The cosy subterranean space, the antique furnishings and crowded bookshelves make it an extremely pleasant place to come for a bite or for drinks.

Beef lovers can indulge their habit at this 12,000-sq-metre restaurant, the city’s biggest. Thanks to clever design, though, it doesn’t feel overwhelmingly large or impersonal, with the huge space divided into six stylish yet informal dining spaces. The steaks menu is impressive and there's a large list of side orders, salads and other main courses to choose from as well.
There’s a fun children’s playroom here, making it a good choice for young families.

(Лехаим MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-572 5616; www.spb-lehaim.ru; Lemontovsky pr 2; mains R390-620; h10am-10pm Sun-Thu)
St Petersburg's only kosher restaurant, Le'chaim whips up carefully prepared Jewish and European dishes.

A decent-value, modern and stylish cafe just moments from St Isaac's Cathedral, Dekabrist sounds like it might be too good to be true. The menu is simple but eclectic, and includes burgers, grilled salmon, pork schnitzel, falafel and a range of salads and desserts, while the two-floor space is comfortable and sociable, even if the lighting is borderline interrogatory.

There's a wide-ranging, pictorial menu that includes delicious bulgogi (Korean beef barbecue), bossam (spicy pork belly) and bajon (seafood pancakes), as well as perennial favourite bibimbap. Service is fast and friendly, and there's a private banquet room, which draws in the foreign groups.

Repa may be Russian for turnip but this delightful restaurant, cheek-by-jowl with the Mariinsky, is anything but rustic. Beautifully painted murals of dancers grace the walls as waiters glide by delivering glasses of sparkling wine and plates of bliny, Kamchatka crab or whole baked fish to elegantly attired customers.

This charming, welcoming place is the restaurant of the Russian Vodka Museum, but it’s good enough to be a destination in its own right. The interior enjoys a grand old-world dacha feel, as does the menu: rack of lamb in pomegranate sauce, whole fried Gatchina trout and Kamchatka crab with porcini mushrooms take you back to imperial tastes and tsarist opulence.
As you’d expect there’s a huge vodka list (shots R100 to R500) and the knowledgeable staff will help you match your meal to one of the many bottles they sell.

It's all about glass at the rooftop restaurant of the Gazprom building. This impressive place definitely has the best views in town and you can almost touch the dome of St Isaac’s Cathedral from the nicest tables (book in advance). Yet despite the fixation, the food is no afterthought, with a delicious range of international fare and a superb wine list on offer.

Set inside a glass, semi-spherical dome, Solaris Lab has magnificent views over the russet rooftops of St Petersburg to the glittering dome of St Isaac's. It draws a mixed crowd of families and hipsters, who linger over pots of high-quality tea and tasty desserts (try the lemon tart). On warm days, there's outdoor seating on the rooftop.
Head up to the top floor to find this remarkable cafe.
SCHUMLICAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.schumli.ru; Kazanskaya ul 40; h9.30am-10pm Mon-Fri, from noon Sat & Sun; W; mSennaya Ploshchad)
With its large range of coffees, sumptuous selection of cakes and – best of all – freshly made Belgian waffles, this small but friendly cafe is a great place to regain flagging energy when wandering around the city. There's an upstairs dining room for full meals (mains R320 to R640), but coffee with a side of something sweet is the real reason to come.
CROCODILEBAR
(Крокодил MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Galernaya ul 18; h12.30pm-midnight; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)
This pleasant place is a fine low-key setting for a drink. Enjoy a dimly lit but artsy interior (including a piano just waiting to be played) and an interesting, eclectic menu (mains R480-920) when hunger strikes.
STIRKA 40BAR
(Стирка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Kazanskaya ul 26; h11am-midnight Sun-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; W; mSennaya Ploshchad)
This friendly joint, whose name means 'washing', has three washing machines, so you can drop off a load and have a few beers while you wait. A novel idea, though one few people seem to take advantage of. Its small and unassuming layout makes it a great place for a quiet drink with a cool young crowd.

oMARIINSKY THEATREBALLET, OPERA
(Мариинский театр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-326 4141; www.mariinsky.ru; Teatralnaya pl 1; tickets R1200-6500; mSadovaya)
St Petersburg's most spectacular venue for ballet and opera, the Mariinsky Theatre is an attraction in its own right. Tickets can be bought online or in person; book in advance during the summer months. The magnificent interior is the epitome of imperial grandeur, and any evening here will be an impressive experience.
Known as the Kirov Ballet during the Soviet era, the Mariinsky has an illustrious history, with troupe members including such ballet greats as Nijinsky, Nureyev, Pavlova and Baryshnikov. In recent years the company has been invigorated by the current artistic and general director, Valery Gergiev, who has worked hard to make the company solvent while overseeing the construction of the impressive and much-needed second theatre, the Mariinsky II, across the Kryukov Canal from the company's green-and-white wedding cake of a building. It is pretty certain that the Mariinsky Theatre will close at some point in 2018 or 2019 for a full (and, again, much needed) renovation, so visit the building's faded grandeur while you can.
MARIINSKY IIBALLET, OPERA

Finally opening its doors in 2013 after more than a decade of construction, legal wrangles, scandal and rumour, the Mariinsky II is a showpiece for St Petersburg's most famous ballet and opera company. It is one of the most technically advanced music venues in the world, with superb sightlines and acoustics from all of its 2000 seats.
There's no denying that the modern-yet-not-modern-enough-to-be-interesting exterior is no great addition to St Petersburg's magnificent wealth of buildings. Inside, though, it's a different story. The interior is a beautifully crafted mixture of backlit onyx, multi-level public areas between which staircases, lifts and escalators weave, limestone walls, marble floors and Swarovski chandeliers. The simple yet superbly designed auditorium boasts plenty of legroom, three stages that can be combined to form one, and an orchestra pit that can hold no fewer than 120 musicians. Serious music fans should come here to see a state-of-the-art opera and ballet venue, while anyone curious to see the results of a decade of building work will also not leave disappointed.
As well as the main auditorium, there are also several smaller venues within the venue (Prokofiev Hall, Stravinsky Foyer, Shchedrin Hall, Mussorgsky Hall), all of which host regular concerts that can be a cheaper alternative to seeing a performance in the main hall.

It manages to preserve the historic brick facade of the set and scenery warehouse that previously stood on this spot, while the modern main entrance, facing ul Dekabristov, is all tinted glass and angular lines, hardly hinting at the beautiful old building behind.
Its array of classical orchestral performances is superb, but be aware that it’s a modern venue, and won’t provide your typical ‘night at the Mariinsky’ atmosphere.
RIMSKY-KORSAKOV CONSERVATORYCLASSICAL MUSIC

This illustrious music school was the first public music school in Russia. The Bolshoy Zal (Big Hall) on the 3rd floor is an excellent place to see performances by up-and-coming musicians throughout the academic year, while the Maly Zal (Small Hall) often hosts free concerts from present students and alumni; check when you’re in town for what’s on.
Founded in 1862, the Conservatory counts Pyotr Tchaikovsky among its alumni and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov among its former faculty. Dmitry Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev are graduates of this institution, as are countless contemporary artistic figures, such as Mariinsky artistic director Valery Gergiev.
YUSUPOV PALACE THEATRETHEATRE
(Театр Юсуповского дворца MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 9883; www.yusupov-palace.ru; nab reki Moyki 94; tickets R700-3200; mSadovaya)
Housed inside the outrageously ornate Yusupov Palace, this elaborate yet intimate venue was the home entertainment centre for one of the city’s foremost aristocratic families. While you can visit the theatre when you tour the palace, seeing a performance here is a treat, as you can imagine yourself the personal guest of the notorious Prince Felix himself.
The shows are a mixed bag – usually a ‘Gala Evening’ that features fragments of various Russian classics.
ST PETERSBURG OPERAOPERA
(Санкт-Петербургская Опера MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 3982; www.spbopera.ru; ul Galernaya 33; tickets R700-2000; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Housed in the sumptuous (and dare we say, rather bizarre) former home of Baron von Derviz, the St Petersburg Opera performs regular operas in its intimate and grandly lavish former ballroom. With just 187 seats, you're guaranteed a good view of the Russian, Italian and German classics, even if the quality can't compare to other more established opera houses in the city.

Terrible title, but not a bad show of traditional Russian folk dancing and music. The pricey two-hour performance features four different folk groups, complete with accordion, balalaika and Cossack dancers. As a bonus, it's held inside the spectacular Nikolayevsky Palace.

Occupying a grand former mansion, this cinema and working film studio specialises mainly in documentary films, including international ones, although they do also screen feature films.
The lobby bar is also a pleasant spot for a drink or something to eat – when they have a week specialising in a nation's cinema here, the menu features dishes from that country.

Cheaper and less atmospheric than Kuznechny Market, Sennoy Market is also centrally located. You’ll find fruit and vegies, as well as freshly caught fish and fresh meat, which makes it a useful spot for self-caterers.

Explore Smolny & Vosstaniya
This area, bisected by the second half of Nevsky pr, breaks down into four districts: Smolny, Liteyny, Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya. An extremely varied place, it contains the closest thing St Petersburg has to a creative hub, as well as its political and diplomatic heart. You could easily spend a few days taking in the major sights of this vast district and still only scratch the surface.
Among the big draws here are the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, worth a half-day visit in the southeast corner, and the collection of museums and historic sites in Liteyny near the Fontanka River, which could warrant a full day (or more) of exploration. Aside from delving into history and culture, there's much to discover just on neighbourhood wanders – from browsing record stores and indie booksellers on streets a few blocks north and south of Nevsky to cafe-hopping on restaurant-lined ul Rubinshteyna. By night, the district has just as much to offer, with some of the best bars in the city, particularly around the Liteyny area.
Slowly gentrifying Vosstaniya still feels a bit run-down, but is the closest Petersburg has to a creative and alternative culture hub, with art galleries, bars and clubs.

ALEXANDER NEVSKY MONASTERY
Named after the patron saint of St Petersburg who led the Russian victory over the Swedes in 1240, the Alexander Nevsky Monastery is the city’s oldest and most eminent religious institution. Today it is a working monastery that attracts scores of devout believers, as well as being the burial place of some of Russia’s most famous artistic figures.


e.o. / shutterstock ©
Historic Victory
Founding the monastery in 1710, Peter the Great sought to link St Petersburg to the historic battle against the Swedes, and thus to underscore Russia’s long history with the newly captured region. Even though the site of Nevsky’s victory was further upstream by the mouth of the Izhora River, the monastery became the centre of the Nevsky cult – his remains were transferred here from Vladimir in 1724 and remain the most sacred item in the cathedral here. In 1797 the monastery became a lavra, the most senior grade of Russian Orthodox monasteries.
Cemeteries
Coming into the monastery complex, you’ll first arrive at the opposing cemeteries, which hold the remains of some of Russia’s most famous names. You’ll find Dostoevsky, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Mussorgsky within the walls of the Necropolis of Art Masters (Некрополь Мастеров Искусств MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.gmgs.ru; Nevsky pr 179/2; incl Necropolis of the 18th Century R400; h9.30am-6pm May-Sep, 11am-4pm Oct-Apr; mPloshchad Aleksandra Nevskogo), which is on your right after you enter the monastery’s main gate. Across the way in the Necropolis of the 18th Century (Некрополь XVIII века MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2; incl Necropolis of Art Masters R400; h9.30am-6pm May-Sep, 11am-4pm Oct-Apr; mPloshchad Aleksandra Nevskogo), you’ll find far more graves, though fewer famous names – look out for polymath Mikhail Lomonosov and Natalya Lanskaya (Pushkin's wife) as well as the graves of the St Petersburg architects Quarenghi, Stasov and Rossi.
Monastery Complex
The monastery itself is within a further wall beyond the cemeteries. The centrepiece is the classical Holy Trinity Alexander Nevsky Lavra (Свято-Троицкая Александро-Невская Лавра MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2; h6am-9pm; mPloshchad Aleksandra Nevskogo), which was built between 1776 and 1790. Hundreds crowd in here on 12 September to celebrate the feast of St Alexander Nevsky, whose remains are in the silver reliquary by the elaborate main iconostasis, which you'll find to the right of the main altar, under a red and gold canopy. Behind the cathedral is the Nikolsky Cemetery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2; h9.30am-6pm May-Sep, 11am-4pm Oct-Apr; mPloshchad Aleksandra Nevskogo), a beautiful spot with a little stream running through it, where more recently deceased Petersburgers can be found, including former mayor Anatoly Sobchak and murdered Duma deputy Galina Starovoytova.
Opposite the cathedral is the Metropolitan’s House ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2) (built 1775–78), the official residence of the spiritual leader of St Petersburg’s Russian Orthodox community. In the surrounding grounds is a smaller cemetery where leading Communist (ie atheist) Party officials and luminaries are buried. On the far right of the grounds facing the canal is St Petersburg’s Orthodox Academy ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2), one of only a handful in Russia (the main one is at Sergiev Posad, near Moscow).
Also on the grounds of the monastery is the State Museum of Urban Sculpture, which holds temporary exhibits of local artists’ work. Enter from outside the monastery walls off pl Alexandra Nevskogo.
Annunciation Church
Between the cemeteries and the main church, you'll pass a ticket kiosk with a separate admission to the old Annunciation Church ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2; R150; h11am-5pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun; mPloschad Alexandra Nevskogo), aka the Blagoveshchenskaya Burial Vault. This was actually the sight of St Petersburg's first stone temple, completed in 1725, though it's been modified over the years. Intended as a burial chamber for the royal family, the ground floor today houses the remains of various minor royals, statesmen and tsarist generals. One of the most impressive tombs belongs to Alexander Golitsyn, who served as a governor of St Petersburg from 1780 to 1783. You'll also find the oldest tombstones in the monastery here – Ivan and Darya Ryevsky, who died in the early 1700s.
Upstairs, the former church today contains a collection of sculptures (dedicated to sorrow, early death and other uplifting topics). There are also a few documents related to the monastery's founding – note the intriguing early map of St Petersburg dating from 1753.
TOP TIPS

AYou can wander for free around most of the grounds and the main church, but you must buy tickets to enter the two most famous cemeteries as well as the Blagoveshchenskaya Burial Vault.
AThe route to the Nikolsky Cemetery is not signed. Take one of the passages on either side of Trinity Cathedral's main entrance – marked with туалет (toilet) signs.
AAt the Blagoveshchenskaya Burial Vault ask the docent for info in English, which is available on a small touchscreen in the corner.
Anyone wanting to visit the Trinity Catheral should dress respectfully (no shorts, or sleeveless tops, for example) and women should cover their heads before entering.
TAKE A BREAK

The monastery's on-site canteen (open 9am to 7pm) has snacks, as well as inexpensive cafeteria-style lunch fare from 1pm to 2pm.
For sandwiches, pastas and snacks, Bien Cafe & Bar ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 166; mains R340-480; h8am-11pm Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; mPl Alexandra Nevskogo) is a 10-minute walk up Nevsky pr.

1Smolny & Liteyny
MUSEUM OF THE DEFENCE & BLOCKADE OF LENINGRADMUSEUM
(Музей обороны и блокады Ленинграда MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.blokadamus.ru; Solyarnoy per 9; R250, audio guide R300; h10am-6pm Thu-Mon, 12.30-8.30pm Wed; mChernyshevskaya)
The grim but engrossing displays here contain donations from survivors, propaganda posters from the blockade period and many photos depicting life and death during the siege. You'll see the meagre bread rations as they dwindled by the month, drawings made by children trying to cope with the loss of family members, and snapshots taken during Shostakovich's Symphony No.7 – composed and played during the siege (by famished musicians), to show the world that Leningrad was not down for the count.
There's decent English signage, though it's worth investing in the audio guide which delves deeper into the experience of life during those horrific 900 days. This museum opened just three months after the blockade was lifted in January 1944 and boasted 37,000 exhibits, including real tanks and aeroplanes. But three years later, during Stalin’s repression of the city, the museum was shut, its director shot, and most of the exhibits destroyed or redistributed. Not until 1985’s glasnost was an attempt made once again to gather documents to reopen the museum; this happened in 1989.
ANNA AKHMATOVA MUSEUM AT THE FOUNTAIN HOUSEMUSEUM
(Музей Анны Ахматовой в Фонтанном Доме MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.akhmatova.spb.ru; Liteyny pr 51; adult/child R120/free, audio guide R200; h10.30am-6.30pm Tue & Thu-Sun, noon-8pm Wed; mMayakovskaya)
Housed in the south wing of the Sheremetyev Palace, this touching and fascinating literary museum celebrates the life and work of Anna Akhmatova, St Petersburg’s most famous 20th-century poet. Akhmatova lived here from 1926 until 1952, invited by the art scholar Nikolai Punin, who lived in several rooms with his family. The two had a long-running affair, somewhat complicated by the tight living situation – Punin didn't want to separate from his wife.
The apartment is on the 2nd floor and is filled with mementos of the poet and correspondence with other writers, as well as elements from the life of Punin (like the overcoat hanging in the entry) and other boarders who lived here; sadly Punin would die in a gulag in 1953. A visit to this contemplative place also provides a glimpse of the interior of an (albeit atypical) apartment from the early to mid-20th century, even if relatively few pieces of original furniture have survived. Particularly moving is the study where, in her own words, Akhmatova 'quite unexpectedly' started her masterpiece Poem Without a Hero in 1940, and her living room where the poet had a famous all-night conversation with British diplomat Isaiah Berlin during the height of Stalinism, an event that had become legendary in Russian literary history. There are information panels in English in each room, as well as an audio guide available in English and several other languages.
Admission also includes the Josef Brodsky American Study. Brodsky did not live here, but his connection with Akhmatova was strong. For lack of a better location, his office has been recreated here, complete with furniture and other artifacts from his adopted home in Massachusetts. Funds are currently being collected to open a Josef Brodsky Museum at the poet's former home a few blocks away on Liteyny pr.
When coming to the museum, be sure to enter from Liteyny pr, rather than from the Fontanka River, where the main palace entrance is, as it's not possible to reach the museum from there.
RIMSKY-KORSAKOV FLAT-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Мемориальный музей-квартира Римского-Корсакова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-713 3208; www.theatremuseum.ru; Zagorodny pr 28; R100, audio guide R100; h11am-6pm Thu-Sun, 1-9pm Wed; mVladimirskaya)
Home of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov for the last 15 years of his life (1893–1908), this is where he composed 11 of his 15 operas, including the Fairy Tale of the Tsar Saltan and the Golden Rooster. The memorial flat (a branch of the State Museum of Theatre & Music) includes four rooms that have been lovingly restored to their original appearance.
A Becker grand piano graces the living room, played over the years by Rachmaninov, Glazunov, Scriabin, Stravinsky – and of course by Rimsky-Korsakov himself. The composer maintained a tradition of hosting musical soirées at his home; this tradition continues today, with periodic concerts (although you are unlikely to see Chaliapin perform here today). Enter from the courtyard.
MUSEUM OF THE ARCTIC & ANTARCTICMUSEUM
(Музей Арктики и Антарктики MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.polarmuseum.sp.ru; ul Marata 24A; adult/child R300/80; h10am-6pm Wed-Sun; mVladimirskaya)
This museum is devoted to polar expeditions, wildlife, cultures and history. The enormous collection includes scientific equipment, maps, taxidermy, photographs, clothing and artefacts from polar cultures. Apart from the stuffed polar bears and emperor penguins, the most impressive exhibit is a 1930s wooden seaplane hanging from the ceiling, used during the Soviet exploration of the 'Red North' under Stalin. As you'd expect there's a strong focus on Soviet polar exploration, and there's very little signage in English.
Its location in the former Old Believers’ Church of St Nicholas is not well disguised, and the premises are very impressive, especially the upper floor, a round gallery overlooked by a crumbling cupola.
SMOLNY CATHEDRALCHURCH
(Смольный собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-577 1421; pl Rastrelli 3/1; belltower adult/child R150/50; hchurch 7am-8pm, bell-tower 10am-6pm; mChernyshevskaya)
If baroque is your thing, then look no further than the sky-blue Smolny Cathedral, an unrivalled masterpiece of the genre that ranks among Bartolomeo Rastrelli’s most amazing creations. The cathedral is the centrepiece of a convent mostly built to Rastrelli’s designs between 1748 and 1757. His inspiration was to combine baroque details with the forest of towers and onion domes typical of an old Russian monastery. You'll get a fascinating perspective over the church and city beyond from the 63m-high belltower.
There’s special genius in the proportions of the cathedral (it gives the impression of soaring upwards), to which the convent buildings are a perfect foil. In stark contrast, the interior is a rather austere plain white as Rastrelli fell from favour before he was able to begin work on it. Recent years, however, have seen ongoing restoration and the transformation of the cathedral (used as a concert hall and exhibition space) back into a working church.
Access to the 277 steps leading up to the belltower is inside the cathedral on the right-hand side.
SHEREMETYEV PALACEMUSEUM
(Шереметьевский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-272 4441; www.theatremuseum.ru; nab reki Fontanki 34; one/two exhibitions R300/370; h11am-7pm Thu-Mon, 1-9pm Wed; mGostiny Dvor)
Splendid wrought-iron gates facing the Fontanka River guard the entrance to the Sheremetyev Palace (built 1750–55), now a branch of the State Museum of Theatre & Music, which has a collection of musical instruments from the 19th and 20th centuries. The Sheremetyev family was famous for the concerts and theatre performances they hosted at their palace, which was a centre of musical life in the imperial capital.
Upstairs, you'll find a lovely collection of 18th-century mahogany furniture, Italian renaissance paintings and rare instruments (including a grand piano that belonged to Glinka), spread among handsomely restored rooms. The most impressive, such as the green drawing room, were designed in second empire baroque style. The ground floor is given over to an enormous collection of more instruments (separate admission fee), but is probably only of great interest to collectors.
MUSEUM OF DECORATIVE & APPLIED ARTSMUSEUM
(Музей прикладного искусства MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-273 3258; www.spbghpa.ru; Solyanoy per 15; adult/student R300/150, excursion in Russian R2000; h11am-5pm Tue-Sat; mChernyshevskaya)
Also known as the Stieglitz Museum, this fascinating establishment is as beautiful as you would expect a decorative arts museum to be. An array of gorgeous objects is on display, from medieval furniture to 18th-century Russian tiled stoves and contemporary works by the students of the Applied Arts School (also housed here). This museum is less visited than some of its counterparts in the city, but the quiet atmosphere only adds to its appeal.
In 1878 the millionaire Baron Stieglitz founded the School of Technical Design and wanted to surround his students with world-class art to inspire them. He began a collection that was continued by his son and was to include a unique array of European and Oriental glassware, porcelains, tapestries, furniture and paintings. It eventually grew into one of Europe’s richest private collections. Between 1885 and 1895, a building designed by architect Maximilian Messmacher was built to house the collection and this building also became a masterpiece. Each hall is decorated in its own unique style, including Italian, Renaissance, Flemish and baroque. The Terem Room, in the style of the medieval Terem Palace of Moscow’s Kremlin, is an opulent knockout.
After the revolution the school was closed, the museum’s collection redistributed to the Hermitage and the Russian Museum, and most of the lavish interiors were brutally painted or plastered over or even destroyed (one room was used as a sports hall). The painstaking renovation continues to this day, despite receiving no state funding.
To find the museum, take the second entrance to the Academy as you walk up Solyanoy per from ul Pestelya. After buying tickets, head up the main staircase, turn right at the top, walk through two halls and then go down the lovely fresco-covered staircase to your left. Once you've visited the museum, feel free to wander around the grand halls and corridors of the Applied Arts School. If you continue the way you came to get to the museum and turn right you'll get to the school's main hall, with its signature skylights, where exhibitions of students' work are often held.
CATHEDRAL OF THE TRANSFIGURATION OF OUR SAVIOURCATHEDRAL
(Спасо-Преображенский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Preobrazhenskaya pl; h8am-8pm; mChernyshevskaya)
The interior of this marvellous 1743 cathedral, which has been beautifully restored and repainted both outside and in, is one of the most gilded in the city. The grand gates bear the imperial double-headed eagle in vast golden busts, reflecting the fact that the cathedral was built on the site where the Preobrazhensky Guards (the monarch’s personal protection unit) had their headquarters.
Architect Vasily Stasov rebuilt the cathedral from 1827 to 1829 in the neoclassical style. It is dedicated to the victory over the Turks in 1828–29; note the captured Turkish cannons, wrapped in chains, in the gate surrounding the cathedral.
SMOLNY INSTITUTEHISTORIC BUILDING
(Смольный институт MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Proletarskoy Diktatury 3; mChernyshevskaya)
Built by Giacomo Quarenghi between 1806 and 1808 as a school for aristocratic girls, the Smolny Institute was thrust into the limelight in 1917 when it became the headquarters for the Bolshevik Central Committee and the Petrograd Soviet. From here, Trotsky and Lenin directed the October Revolution, and in the Hall of Acts (Aktovy zal) on 25 October, the All-Russian Congress of Soviets conferred power on a Bolshevik government led by Lenin.
The Smolny Institute served as the seat of Soviet power until March 1918, when the capital was relocated to Moscow. In 1934, the powerful Leningrad Party chief Sergei Kirov was assassinated in its corridors, on orders from Stalin, ridding the Soviet leader of a perceived rival and simultaneously providing the perfect pretext for the notorious Leningrad purges. Today St Petersburg’s governor continues to run the city from here. Although it's closed to the public, some of the big tour companies, such as SPB Tours (www.spb-tours.com), include a short visit inside the Smolny Institute on multiday tours around St Petersburg.
TAURIDE PALACE & GARDENSPARK
(Таврический дворец и сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h8am-8pm Aug-Mar, to 10pm May-Jul, closed Apr; mChernyshevskaya)
Catherine the Great had this baroque palace built in 1783 for Grigory Potemkin, a famed general and her companion for many years. Today it is home to the Commonwealth of Independent States and is closed to the public. The gardens, on the other hand, are open to all; once the romping grounds of the tsarina, they became a park for the people under the Soviets, and their facilities include a lake, several cafes and an entertainment centre.
The palace was named after Tavria (another name for Crimea, the region that Potemkin conquered) and was a thank-you present to Potemkin from Catherine. Catherine’s bitter son, Paul I, turned the palace into a barracks after his ascension to the throne in 1796, which ruined most of the lavish interiors. Between 1906 and 1917 the State Duma, the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet all met here; in the 1930s it housed the All-Union Agricultural Communist University, a fate that would have no doubt horrified Catherine the Great.
GOLITSYN LOFTCULTURAL CENTRE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reky Fontanki 20; mGostiny Dvor)
The new epicentre of creativity on the Fontanka River is this mazelike complex of shops, bars, cafes, beauty salons, tattoo parlours, galleries and even a hostel with capsule-style bunks. Enter via the archway into a large courtyard, which is spread with outdoor eating and drinking spots in the summer, then head up any of the stairwells into the five buildings for a bit of urban exploration. On weekends the centre stages one-off events, such as craft markets, concerts and film screenings.
According to legend, literary salons were held here in the early 1800s and Pushkin was a regular guest – some claim he even wrote his political screed 'Volnost' ('Freedom') in the rooms today occupied by the Ziferburg cafe.
LENINGRAD CENTREARTS CENTRE
(Ленинград центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-242 9999; www.leningradcenter.ru; Potyomkinskaya ul 4; hnoon-1am; W; mChernyshevskaya)
This new high-tech entertainment complex houses two theatres, a gallery, a top-floor restaurant and two bars on the ground floor. It's set in a former mansion that was converted into a massive cinema during the Soviet era. In 2014, the building reopened in its present form and hosts a wide-ranging repertoire of concerts, dance performances, musical theatre and film screenings. You can't miss the video wall in the foyer – said to be the largest in Europe.
It's worth stopping by if passing through the area. Most exhibitions in the gallery are free.
BOLSHOY DOMHISTORIC BUILDING
(Большой дом MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Liteyny pr 4; mChernyshevskaya)
Noi Trotsky’s monolithic design for the local KGB headquarters (and currently the St Petersburg headquarters of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, its successor organisation) is referred to by everyone as the ‘Bolshoy Dom’ or ‘Big House’. It’s a fierce-looking block of granite built in 1932 in the late-constructivist style and was once a byword for fear among the people of the city: most people who were taken here during the purges were never heard from again. Obviously, the building is not open to the public.
Employees who have worked here include Vladimir Putin during his KGB career. The Bolshoy Dom made the news in 2010, when the subversive art collective Voina (War) drew a 65m-long penis on the nearby Liteyny Bridge, which, when the bridge was raised, made a very clear statement towards the FSB.
ANNA AKHMATOVA MONUMENTMONUMENT
(Памятник Анне Ахматовой MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab Robespierre; mChernyshevskaya)
This moving statue of St Petersburg’s most famous 20th-century poet was unveiled in 2006, across the river from the notorious Kresty holding prison, to mark the 40th anniversary of Akhmatova’s death. The location is no coincidence – Kresty Prison was where Akhmatova herself queued for days in the snow for news of her son after his multiple arrests during Stalin’s terror.
The inscription on the monument comes from her epic poem ‘Requiem’, in which she describes life during the purges. It reads: ‘That’s why I pray not for myself/But for all of you who stood there with me/Through fiercest cold and scorching July heat/Under a towering, completely blind red wall.’
MONUMENT TO THE VICTIMS OF POLITICAL REPRESSIONMONUMENT
(Памятник жертвам политических репрессий MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab Robespierre; mChernyshevskaya)
This gruesome piece of sculpture by Russian artist Mikhail Shemyakin was unveiled in 1995, shortly after the end of the Soviet Union, and during a time of relative lustration. The scultpure is centred on two sphinxes, both of which look, from one side, like beautiful creatures. However, view them from the other side (facing the infamous Kresty Prison across the water) and it's clear the beauty has been corrupted beyond recognition and half the face is a mere skull.
Lines of writing from many of the Soviet system's victims are engraved on the monument's granite base. It's a sad and deeply moving place.

This now legendary locale is a former apartment block – affectionately called by its street address despite the fact that the public entrance is actually on Ligovsky pr – that contains studio and gallery space, as well as music clubs Fish Fabrique and Fabrique Nouvelle, plus an assortment of other shops and galleries. It offers a unique opportunity to hang out with local musicians and artists, who are always eager to talk about their work.
One ticket gives admission to all the galleries.

Named after Sergey Kuryokhin (1954–96), a legend of the Russian contemporary arts and music scene, this is the temporary home of the arts centre until its new home on Vasilevsky Island is ready (late 2019). You can view some of the talented avant-garde artist's work and that of his contemporaries including the band Kino and performance artist Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe. You can also see exhibitions of new works that push the artistic boundaries.
The centre also organises SKIF, an international music and arts festival held in September with shows at the New Stage of the Alexandrinsky Theatre.

Opened in 2005, K-Gallery houses one of the largest private collections of Russian artwork in the city. The two-floor space features a changing array of exhibitions (with three to five shows per year) featuring pieces dating from the late 19th-century to the Soviet avant-garde.
WORTH A DETOUR
THE SOVIET SOUTH

Sprawling southern St Petersburg was once planned to be the centre of Stalin’s new Leningrad, and anyone interested in Stalinist architecture should make the easy trip down here to the Moskovskaya metro station for a wander around and to see a clutch of sights all within easy walking distance.
HOUSE OF SOVIETSNOTABLE BUILDING
(Дом советов GOOGLE MAP ; Moskovsky pr 212; mMoskovskaya)
Right outside the Moskovskaya metro station you’ll see the House of Soviets, a staggeringly bombastic Stalinist beauty. Planned to be the central administrative building of Stalin’s Leningrad, it was built with the leader’s neoclassical tastes in mind. Begun by Noi Trotsky in 1936, it was not finished until after the war, by which time the architect had been purged. Nonetheless, this magnificent, sinister building is a great example of Stalinist design, with its columns and bas-reliefs and an enormous frieze running across the top. Today it houses the Moskovsky Region’s local administration and is closed to the public.
MONUMENT TO THE HEROIC DEFENDERS OF LENINGRADMONUMENT
(Монумент героическим защитникам Ленинграда GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; pl Pobedy; R200; h10am-6pm Thu-Mon, until 5pm Tue; mMoskovskaya)
Due south of the House of Soviets, on Moskovsky pr is this awe-inspiring monument. Centred around a 48m-high obelisk, the monument, unveiled in 1975, is a sculptural ensemble of bronze statues symbolising the city’s encirclement and eventual victory in WWII. On a lower level, a second bronze ring 40m in diameter surrounds a very moving sculpture standing in the centre. Haunting symphonic music creates a sombre atmosphere to guide you downstairs to the underground exhibition in a huge, mausoleum-like interior.
Here, the glow of 900 bronze lamps creates an eeriness matched by the sound of a metronome (the only sound heard by Leningraders on their radios throughout the war save for emergency announcements), showing that the city’s heart was still beating. Twelve thematically assembled showcases feature items from the war and siege. An electrified relief map in the centre of the room shows the shifting front lines of the war.
PARK POBEDY
PARK
( GOOGLE MAP ; Moskovsky pr; h6am-midnight; mPark Pobedy)
This large green space gathers a cross-section of Petersburgers, including young families, teens and canoodling couples who stroll the leafy paths and enjoy the views over the ponds and flower gardens. Built to celebrate Russia’s victory in WWII, the park is full of statues of Soviet war heroes and has a beneficent depiction of Lenin interacting with small children. To get to the Park, walk 1.7km north up Moskovsky pr, or hop on a bus or tram heading north.

Russia in all its grit and glory – from the industrial sprawl of Magnitogorsk to the glittering domes of Moscow – is on full display at this vast recreation of the motherland in miniature. One huge room contains mountains, cities, rivers and lakes, with lots of mechanised action that you can observe while strolling around the perimeter of the varied landscape. Tiny trains shuttle around the countryside, helicopters ascend, and trucks and cars move across bridges, up mountain roads and along industrial sites.
The level of detail is staggering, from the spot-on recreations of Soviet-style apartment blocks, to the clothing worn by waiting passengers at the train depot. It's hard not to be charmed by this ambitious, miniaturised work of art.

Fyodor Dostoevsky lived in flats all over the city (mostly in Sennaya), but his final residence is this ‘memorial flat’ where he lived from 1878 until he died in 1881. The apartment remains as it was when the Dostoevsky family lived here, including the study where he wrote The Brothers Karamazov, and the office of Anna Grigorievna, his wife, who recopied, edited and sold all of his books.
The objects here include an image of Raphael's Sistine Virgin, which Doestoevsky was quite fond of; a clock that belonged to Dostoevsky's younger brother, which shows the hour and time when Dostoevsky died; and various family photos (including Dostoevsky's daughter Liubov Fyodorovna, who also became a writer). Apart from the six-room flat, there are two other rooms devoted to his novels, his travels and his legacy. A rather gloomy sculpted likeness of the man himself (as if there’s any other kind) is just outside the nearby Vladimirskaya metro station.
LUMIERE HALLARTS CENTRE
( GOOGLE MAP ; %8-812-407 1731; www.lumierehall.ru/spb; nab Obvodny kanala 74; R500; h11am-11pm; mFruzenskaya)
In a once-industrial part of the city, Lumiere Hall hosts large-format multimedia exhibitions – basically massive 3D projections in a 360-degree space, with audio commentary on the works displayed and the artists behind the creations. Take a seat on beanbags and enjoy the show. Recent installations have included projections of paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky, Van Gogh and Gustav Klimt. It's a 1km walk from the metro station. Head up to the canal and turn right.
On Friday and Saturday, Lumiere Hall also has late-night screenings of popular Hollywood and foreign films. These kick off around 11.30pm.
VLADIMIRSKY CATHEDRALCATHEDRAL
(Владимирский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Vladimirsky pr 20; h8am-6pm, services 6pm daily; mVladimirskaya)
This fantastic, five-domed cathedral, ascribed to Domenico Trezzini, is the namesake of this neighbourhood. Incorporating both baroque and neoclassical elements, the cathedral was built in the 1760s, with Giacomo Quarenghi’s neoclassical belltower added later in the century. One famous member of the congregation was Dostoevsky, who lived around the corner. The cathedral was closed in 1932 and the Soviets turned it into an underwear factory, but in 1990 it was reconsecrated and resumed its originally intended function.
The baroque iconostasis was originally installed in the private chapel of the Anichkov Palace, but was transferred here in 1808. For an impressive perspective on the onion domes, have a drink in Birreria across the road.
MUSEUM OF THE IMPERIAL PORCELAIN FACTORYMUSEUM
( GOOGLE MAP ; www.ipm.ru; pr Obukhovsky Oborony 151; R300; h10am-7pm Mon-Fri; mLomonosovskaya)
Run as an outpost of the Hermitage, this superb museum has a stellar display of the various designs the factory has produced over the centuries and will appeal to anyone interested in this very Russian handicraft. Among the collection you'll find everything from bespoke dinner services used by the tsars to unique constructivist tea sets created in the 1920s, indicative of the factory's versatility in serving its various political masters.
Don't miss the exquisite collection of porcelain statuettes depicting the various peoples of Russia and beyond, with clothing so beautifully rendered it looks like fabric. There's also a porcelain shop here where prices are slightly lower compared to the factory's city-centre outlets. To get here, turn left out of the metro station and walk under the bridge. Turn left on the embankment and you’ll see the factory ahead.
DERZHAVIN HOUSE-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей-усадьба Державина GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Fontanki 118; adult/student R300/200; h10am-6pm Wed & Fri-Mon, noon-8pm Thu; mTekhnologichesky Institut)
This grand old Petersburg residence was the home to court poet Gabriel Derzhavin (1743–1816), one of Russia's greatest early writers, who recognised the genius of Alexander Pushkin during Pushkin's own childhood. Having been divided into some 60 communal apartments under the Soviets, the mansion was fully renovated in 2003 and is now a charming museum. The focus of the house is Derzhavin's own study, with its three secret entrances.
After exploring the house, you can take a stroll in the pretty gardens with its little bridges and tiny canals; you can also enter the greenery via Derzhavinksy per.
STATE MUSEUM OF URBAN SCULPTUREMUSEUM
(Государственный Музей Городской Скульптуры MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.gmgs.ru; Chernoretsky per 2; R150; hnoon-6pm Sat-Wed)
Despite the name, this two-storey gallery typically has more than just sculpture on display at its changing exhibitions. You may find paintings, video art and mixed media – most of which are created by avant-garde St Petersburg artists. There are a few sculptures in front of the gallery – and occasional installations tucked in the museum courtyard (staff will be sure to take you there if so). Enter from just outside the monastery walls off pl Alexandra Nevskogo.
TRINITY CATHEDRALCATHEDRAL
(Троицкий собор GOOGLE MAP ; Izmailovsky pr 7A; h9am-7pm Mon-Sat, 8am-8pm Sun, services 10am daily & 5pm Fri-Sun; mTekhnologichesky Institut)
The Trinity Cathedral boasts stunning blue cupolas emblazoned with golden stars. A devastating fire in 2006 caused the 83m-high central cupola to collapse, but it has been fully restored and now looks even better than it did before. Construction of the vast cathedral began in 1828, according to a design by Vasily Stasov. The cathedral was consecrated in 1835 and functioned as the chapel for the Izmailovsky Guards, who were garrisoned next door.
In honour of the Russian victory in the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, the memorial Column of Glory was constructed out of 128 Turkish cannons. (The present monument was erected on the north side of the cathedral in 2003: it is an exact replica of the original, which was destroyed by Stalin.)
The cathedral was famed for its immense collection of icons, as well as several silver crosses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. After the revolution, most of these treasures were looted, the ornate interiors were destroyed and the cathedral was finally closed in 1938.
Trinity Cathedral was returned to the Orthodox Church in 1990, but the interior is decidedly bare, especially compared with its previous appearance. It was here that Fyodor Dostoevsky married his second wife, Anna Snitkina, in 1867.

This fantastic conversion of the former Smolninsky Bread Factory has plenty to keep you interested, including many of the original factory fittings seamlessly merged with the thoroughly contemporary design. A young creative crowd flock to the mazelike space that includes galleries and exhibition spaces, eye-catching shops, a hostel, a bar and a cafe with a great summer terrace all spread out over five floors. In the yard, converted shipping containers house yet more pop-up clothing shops, record sellers, cafes and eateries whipping up creative street food.
Keep an eye out for stores like Krakatau for stylish men's wear, and Laser B, which sells T-shirts, dresses and accessories featuring bold graphic works. In the summer months the roof of the building is open 24 hours a day for views overlooking the city; there are also occasional open-air concerts held here.

The recipes aren't overly complicated and the fine ingredients speak for themselves in flavour-rich dishes like aubergine baked with suluguni (a type of cheese), pork dumplings, and tender lamb stew with coriander. Don't miss the excellent khachapuri (cheese bread), which comes in a dozen varieties and is whipped up by the bakers in front.

This historic restaurant, which has roots dating back to 1785, evokes a touch of royal grandeur with its elegantly set dining room, exquisite cuisine and rather theatrical service. Start off with caviar or foie gras, before moving on to grilled Ladoga white fish or beef Stroganoff a la Palkin.
BLOKSTEAK$$$
(Блок MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-415 4040; www.blok.restaurant; Potyomkinskaya ul 4; mains R750-5800; hnoon-1am; W; mChernyshevskaya)
On the top floor of the Leningrad Centre, Blok aims to dazzle with big, bold artworks, a sculptural chandelier running down the glass-covered ceiling, and two terraces with sweeping skyline views. None of this detracts from the star of the show: perfectly grilled steak, which comes in 23 varieties – including muromets, a tender perfection which is dry-aged in house.

BEKITZERISRAELI$
(Бекицер MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-926 4342; www.facebook.com/bktzr; ul Rubinshteyna 40; mains R180-450; hnoon-6am Mon-Fri, from noon Sat & Sun; Wv; mDostoyevskaya)
Always crowded and spilling out into the street, this Israel-themed eatery and drinking den lures hip and joyful people with its creative cocktails, Israeli Shiraz and the best falafel wraps this side of the Baltic Sea. Other culinary temptations include sabich salad (with eggplant, egg, hummus and tahini), appetiser spreads with baba ghanoush and pitas, and rather imaginative matzah pizzas.
BGL CAFE & MARKETBAGELS$
( GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Fontanki 96; mains R170-340; h11am-11pm; Wv)
Finally, somewhere decent to enjoy bagels! This sunny little cafe is popular with a young, well-read crowd, and has a great location overlooking the Fontanka River.

GREY'SBISTRO$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.greys-bistro.ru; Konnaya ul 5/3; mains R380-580; h11am-11pm; W; mPl Vosstaniya)
The name may be literal (the walls are an understated light grey that complements the dark timber floors and stylish lighting), but the food is far from dour. Grey's excels at uncomplicated classics like fish soup, homemade roasts, rack of lamb and grilled trout, along with popular desserts like berry tart – all quite reasonably priced.
GASTRONOMIKAINTERNATIONAL$$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-640 1616; 6th fl, Stremyannaya ul 21; mains R560-1290; hnoon-1am; Wv; mVladimiriskaya)
On the top floor of the Olympic Plaza shopping complex, Gastronomika is the go-to spot for a wide-ranging menu of pizzas, barbecue brisket, Asian noodle soups and salmon or halibut with rich sauces. The cooking gets solid reviews, but the real draw is the outstanding view over the rooftops of St Petersburg.
A party vibe prevails on weekends, when DJs spin from 9pm onward, and diners receive a welcome drink.
TASTE TO EATRUSSIAN$$
(Вкус Есть GOOGLE MAP ; %812-983 3376; http://tastetoeat.tastetoeat.ru; nab reki Fontanki 82; mains R480-680; h1-11pm; W)

(География MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-340 0074; www.geo-rest.com; ul Rubinshteyna 5; R450-700; hnoon-midnight; Wv; mMayakovskaya)
True to its name, this hip little place takes diners on a culinary journey around the globe, with a standout menu of Singapore-style noodles with seafood, Szechuan beef with jasmine rice and Thai coconut soup, plus plenty of Russian classics (like homemade dumplings).
An equally eclectic soundtrack, vintage travel posters, and a huge cocktail menu all set the stage for a fine start to the night. DJs spin on Friday and Saturday nights (from 9pm).
SCHASTYEITALIAN$$
(Счастье MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-572 2675; www.schastye.com; ul Rubinshteyna 15/17; mains R420-800; h9am-midnight Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; Wv; mMayakovskaya)
‘Happiness’ comes in several forms here: a multiroomed venue full of cosy nooks and crannies to huddle up in, an expansive Italian menu, delicious pastries and tempting sweets, and lavish and thoroughly warm (if somewhat random) decor (think jars full of pasta and photo frames with stock shots of family members).
BAKLAZHANGEORGIAN$$

On the fourth floor of the posh Galeria shopping center, Baklazhan is yet another success from the Ginza chain. The stylish setting, piping hot khachapuri (cheese bread) and excellent Georgian cuisine will make you forget you're dining in a mall. Baklazhan (eggplant) plays a starring role in tasty roasted eggplant salads and stuffed eggplant with cheese.
A GIFT TO YOUNG HOUSEWIVES

The most popular cookbook in 19th-century Russia was called A Gift to Young Housewives, a collection of favourite recipes and household management tips that turned into a bestseller. The author, Elena Molokhovets, a housewife herself, was dedicated to her 10 children, to the Orthodox Church, and to her inexperienced ‘female compatriots’ who might need assistance keeping their homes running smoothly.
This book was reprinted 28 times between 1861 and 1914, and Molokhovets added new recipes and helpful hints to each new edition. The last edition included literally thousands of recipes, as well as pointers on how to organise an efficient kitchen, how to set a proper table and how to clean a cast-iron pot.
Molokhovets received an enormously positive response from readers who credited her with no less than preserving their family life. The popular perception of the time was that a wife’s primary responsibility was to keep her family together, and keeping her husband well fed seemed to be the key. As one reader wrote, ‘A good kitchen is…not an object of luxury. It is a token of the health and well-being of the family, upon which all the remaining conditions of life depend’. Molokhovets included some of these letters in later editions as testimony to her work.
The classic cookbook was never reprinted during the Soviet period. The details of sumptuous dishes and fine table settings – let alone questions of etiquette and style – would certainly have been considered bourgeois by the Soviet regime. Yet still, copies of this ancient tome survived, passed down from mother to daughter like a family heirloom. Today, the book reads not only as a cookbook, but also as a lesson in history and sociology.
6DRINKING & NIGHTLIFE

6Smolny & Liteyny
oUNION BAR & GRILLBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/barunion; Liteyny pr 55; h6pm-4am Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat; W; mMayakovskaya)
The Union is a glamorous and fun place, characterised by one enormous long wooden bar, low lighting and a New York feel. It's all rather adult, with a serious cocktail list and designer beers on tap. The hip 20- and 30-something crowd packs in on weekends to catch live bands, but it's generally quiet during the week.
There's good snack fare (burgers, hummus with pita, shawarma) from the grill in the back room, and a tiny rear patio for the smoking crowd.
oHATBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Belinskogo 9; h7pm-5am; mGostiny Dvor)
The wonderfully retro-feeling Hat is a serious spot for jazz and whiskey lovers, who come for the nightly live music and the cool cat crowd that makes this wonderfully designed bar feel like it's been transported out of 1950s Greenwich Village. A very welcome change of gear for St Petersburg's drinking options, but it can be extremely packed at weekends.
oCOMMODEBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.commode.club; ul Rubinshteyna 1, 2nd fl; per hr R180; h4pm-2am Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat)
Stopping in for drinks at Commode feels more like hanging out in an upper-class friend's stylish apartment. After getting buzzed up, you can hang out in various high-ceilinged rooms, catch a small concert or poetry slam, browse books in the quasi-library room, play a round of table football, or chat with the easygoing crowd that have fallen for the place.
Drink and snack prices and are kept low (cocktails run R100 to R150), but you'll pay by the hour – not unlike an anticafe – for time spent at this so-called self-cost bar.
oREDRUMBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-416 1126; www.facebook.com/redrumbarspb; ul Nekrasova 26; h4pm-1am Sun-Thu, to 3am Fri & Sat; mMayakovskaya)
One of St Petersburg's best drinking dens, Redrum hits all the right notes. It has a cosy, white brick interior, a welcoming, easygoing crowd, and a stellar selection of craft brews (some two dozen on tap). There's also good pub fare on hand to go with that creative line-up of Session Indian Pale Ales, sour ales, Berliner Weisse and porters.
Have a seat at the small circular bar and get ordering tips from the friendly bartenders, who will be happy to point you in the right direction.
DEAD POETS BARCOCKTAIL BAR

This very cool place has a sophisticated drinks menu and an almost unbelievable range of spirits stacked along the long bar and served up by a committed staff of mixologists. It's more of a quiet place, with low lighting, a jazz soundtrack and plenty of space to sit down.
TERMINAL BARBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Belinskogo 11; h2pm-4am; W; mMayakovskaya)
A slice of New York bohemia on one of the city’s most happening streets, Terminal is great for a relaxed drink with friends, in a small, intimate setting. Bar staff take their cocktails seriously.

Hipster ground zero in St Petersburg is this two-room basement place that is massively popular with a cool student crowd. The frenetic front room becomes a dancefloor later in the evening, while the quiet backroom is a chill-out area. DJs spin nightly and there's a big cocktail list.
BAR 812COCKTAIL BAR

ZIFERBURGANTICAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Fontanki 20; per min R3; h11am-midnight; mGostiny Dvor)
Tucked inside the Golitsyn Loft, this is one of St Petersburg's loveliest spots to while away an afternoon. Elegant furnishings, huge windows and a piano in the corner set the scene. Like other anti-cafes, you'll pay by the minute, with drinks and cookies part of the deal.
The price tops out at R540, meaning you won't pay more than that even if you spend all day here.
FARSH & BOCHKABAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.beercard.ru; ul Belinskogo 11; h5pm-midnight Mon-Thu, noon-2am Fri & Sat, noon-midnight Sun)
On bar-lined ul Belinskogo, Farsh & Bochka stands out for its wide-ranging line-up of craft brews, with over 30 on draft, including SPB and Russian varieties.

PIVNAYA KARTABAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.beercard.ru; ul Vosstaniya 55; hnoon-11pm; mChernyshevskaya)
A mecca for beer lovers, Pivnaya Karta has over 400 varieties of beer from around the globe, with some 20 different rotating draft selections. That said, it's a small stand-up space that feels more bottle shop than bar, and of interest for only a small slice of SPB society.
DRINKS WITH A VIEW

SKY BARBAR
( GOOGLE MAP ; Top fl, Hotel Azimut, Lermontovsky pr 43/1; h5pm-1am; W; mBaltiyskaya)
The top floor of the Soviet-era Azimut Hotel, one of the city's biggest eyesores, is also home to the Sky Bar, quite simply the best place to get a bird's-eye view of the city. Taking up much of the 18th floor, the bar has plenty of space to sit back and enjoy the incredible view of the historic centre through its vast floor-to-ceiling windows. In addition to cocktails and coffee, there's also a full food menu.
Even the nearest metro is some distance away, however, so it's best to wander here along the Fontanka from the centre.
6Vladimirskaya & Vosstaniya
oZIFERBLATANTICAFE

A charming multiroom 'free space' that has started a worldwide trend, Ziferblat is the original anticafe in St Petersburg. Coffee, tea, soft drinks and biscuits are included as you while away your time playing chess and other board games, reading, playing instruments (help yourself to the piano and guitar) or just hanging out with the arty young locals who frequent its cosy rooms.
The unsigned entrance is hard to find. Look for the big #81 sign on Nevsky pr, then find the door with buzzers just east of there. Ring Циферблат (labelled in Russian only).
BEER GEEKCRAFT BEER
(Биргик MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-643 2484; https://vk.com/beergeekspb; ul Rubinshteyna 2/45; hnoon-midnight; mMayakovskaya)
Duck into the courtyard to find this very cosy basement bar that's recommended by local beer fanatics for its regularly updated range of 12 local and international craft ales on tap and curated selection of bottles to drink in or take out.
Sit either on the couple of stools at the bar or on some wooden tiered steps alongside three cuddly toy tigers and a moose!
DYUNIBAR

What looks like a small suburban house sits rather incongruously here amid repurposed warehouses in this vast courtyard. There’s a cosy indoor bar and a sand-covered outside area with table football and ping pong, which keeps the cool kids happy all night in the summer months. To find it, simply continue 300m in a straight line from the courtyard entrance on Ligovsky pr.
DJs spin from Wednesdays to Sundays, with the odd band from time to time.
FISH FABRIQUE NOUVELLELIVE MUSIC
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.fishfabrique.spb.ru; Ligovsky pr 53; h3pm-late; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)

Stop in for good wines by the glass (from R270), classic cocktails and an eclectic lineup of jazz, blues and rockabilly.
If you play an instrument, ask about joining in. Look for the archway entrance just visible from the street.
BIRRERIABAR
(Биррерия MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/birreriaspb; 2nd fl, Vladimirsky pr 19, Vladimirsky Passage; hnoon-2am; mVladimirskaya)
On the second floor of the Vladimirsky Passage shopping complex, this upscale place has an excellent line-up of Belgian, German and English beers on tap and far more selections by the bottle. Good bistro fare and great views of the Vladimirsky Cathedral.
NA ZDOROVYE!

‘To your health!’ is what Russians say when they throw back a shot of vodka. But this pronouncement hardly suffices as a proper toast in a public forum or an intimate drinking session among friends. A proper toast requires thoughtfulness and sincerity.
A few themes prevail. The first toast of the night often acknowledges the generosity of the host, while the second usually recognises the beauty of the ladies present. In mixed company, you can’t go wrong raising your glass to international friendship (za mezhdunarodnuyu druzhbu) or world peace (za miravoy mir). But in all cases, the toast requires a personal anecdote or a profound insight, as well as a bit of rambling preamble to make it meaningful.
In Russia, drinking vodka is a celebration of life in all its complexity – the triumph, the tragedy and the triviality. A toast is a vocalisation of that celebration, so say it like you mean it. And drink it in the same way – zalpom – bottoms up!

Very small and very New York, this cool club is the best place in the city to hear modern, innovative jazz music, as well as blues, bluegrass and various other styles (see the website for a list of what’s on). The space is tiny, so book a table online if you want to sit down.

Nowadays, the newer Fabrique Nouvelle in the same courtyard hosts concerts nightly, while the old Fish Fabrique only has them on weekends; whichever one you’re in, you’re sure to rub shoulders with an interesting crowd.

Now this local celebrity showcases her stuff at her Nevsky pr boutique, where you’ll find her striking monochromatic prêt-à-porter designs as well as her famous scarves.
Each scarf is an extraordinary work of art – one of a kind, made from silk and elaborately hand-embroidered in a painstaking process that takes three to four months (with prices from R179,000). Less expensive in-store items include shoes, pillowcases and duvet covers.

2SPORTS & ACTIVITIES

COACHMEN'S BANYABATHHOUSE

Multilevel complex with both ordinary and lux banya as well as private rooms and saunas for you to rent with up to eight friends. The attendants are friendly and the patrons take their bathing very seriously. Last entry to all baths is 9pm.
DEGTYARNIYE BATHSBATHHOUSE

These modern baths are divided up into men’s and women’s sections, or you can book private unisex bani (hot baths) of varying degrees of luxury (these accommodate up to 14 people). Prices are cheaper before 1pm on weekdays. Minimum charge of two hours.
MYTNINSKIYE BANIBATHHOUSE
(Мытнинские бани MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mybanya.spb.ru; ul Mytninskaya 17-19; per hr R200-350; h8am-10pm Fri-Tue; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
Unique in the city, Mytninskiye Bani is heated by a wood furnace, just like the log-cabin bathhouses that are still found in the Russian countryside. It's actually the oldest communal banya (hot bath) in the city, and in addition to a parilka (steam room) and plunge pool, the private ‘lux’ banya (R1000 to R2000 per hour) includes a swanky lounge area with leather furniture and a pool table.
KAZACHIYE BANIBATHHOUSE
(Казачьи бани GOOGLE MAP ; www.kazbani.ru; Bolshoy Kazachy per 11; per 2hr R100-300, private banya per hr R850-1700; h8am-10pm Tue-Sun; mPushkinskaya)
Following a trend that is occurring throughout the city, the communal banya is something of an afterthought here. The majority of the venue is given over to very swanky, private bani, which are an excellent option for groups of up to 10 people. The cheaper communal banya is good value though.
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday are for women; Wednesday, Friday and Sunday are for men.

Explore Vasilyevsky Island
This large, triangular island is among the oldest neighbourhoods in St Petersburg, especially the eastern tip known as the Strelka (‘tongue of land’). Crammed with classical buildings housing institutions, excellent museums such as the Kunstkamera and Menshikov Palace, and the sprawling campus of St Petersburg State University, this is the best place to start your exploration of the island.
Further back from the Strelka, Vasilyevsky Ostrov (or VO as it's commonly shortened to) is an orderly, residential place, with a grid system of wide roads lined with shops, restaurants and cafes. Make a beeline for the Russian Academy of Arts Museum, the historic St Andrew's Cathedral, the stunningly decorated Temple of the Assumption, and the compact Novy Museum showcasing late-20th-century art from the Soviet Union.
The northern and western ends of the island are rather post industrial and remote. Even so, there are things worth coming out this way to see, including the fantastic Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art, and the chance to tour around the Icebreaker Krasin and two submarines. Transport wonks will also be thrilled to find museums devoted to the city's metro and tram systems.
Local Life
ABridge Advice If you’re staying on Vasilyevsky Island, remember that in the summer months the bridges go up at night. Dvortsovy most's timetable is up at 1.10am and down for 20 minutes at 2.50am before going up again until 4.55am. Blagoveshchensky most is crossable from 2.45am until 3.10am and then not again until 5am.
ACool Street Hang with the locals on 6-ya and 7-ya liniya, the main pedestrian and commercial street of Vasilyevsky Island. Lined with cafes, bars, restaurants and shops, this is where to escape the tourist crowds at the Strelka.
ANightlife events Concerts and other events are often staged at Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art; also check out about various parties held up on the terrace of Artmuza.
Getting There & Away
AMetro The most useful metro stations are Vasileostrovskaya on Line 3 at the island’s heart and the nab Makarova/1-ya i Kadetskaya liniya exit from Sportivnaya on Line 5.
ABus The number 7 bus goes between Primorskaya to pl Vosstaniya, via Nalichnaya ul, all of Bolshoy pr and Nevsky pr. Trolleybus 10 and 11 run similar routes.

Lonely Planet's Top Tip
The Palace Bridge Wellness Club is one of the city's best places for a sauna and swimming. If you're travelling with children under three, drop in on a Wednesday when it's parents and under-threes only from 7am to 6.30pm. Every day, children under three pay nothing and those between three and 14 get in for half-price, but only before 6pm; after that it's adults only.

ERARTA MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART
Erarta's superb hoard of 2300 pieces of Russian contemporary art trumps its somewhat far-flung location. Housed in an ingeniously converted neoclassical Stalinist building, the museum is spread over five floors, with the main galleries focused on the permanent collection. There are also installation spaces, plenty of temporary exhibitions, occasional shows, plus a good restaurant and gift shop.

Permanent Collection
The permanent collection is an excellent survey of the past half-century of Russian art. It's particularly strong on late-Soviet underground art. One nice curatorial touch is the frequent inclusion of objects depicted in paintings – a bowl of apples will sit, for example, in front of a painting entitled Apple Picking.
Expanded Spaces
A new wing has significantly expanded the space for temporary exhibitions. One unusual feature is the inclusion of commercial galleries, where the work on display is also for sale. These tend to feature contemporary installations, paintings, video art and sculpture by Russian artists, and are worth checking out.
Immersive Installations
Consider trying out at least one of eight 'U Space Total Installations', (R200 for up to five people), small themed rooms that immerse you in worlds ranging from childhood to outer space. An extra ticket (R250) is also required for the Theatre With No Actors, a sound-and-vision show on the 2nd floor.

KUNSTKAMERA
Also known as the Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology, the Kunstkamera was the city’s first museum, founded in 1714 by Peter himself. It is famous largely for its ghoulish collection of monstrosities, preserved ‘freaks’, two-headed mutant foetuses, deformed animals and odd body parts, all collected by Peter, who had issued an edict that such malformed, stillborn infants were sent to him from across Russia.

Babies in Bottles
Peter wanted to demonstrate that malformations were not the result of the evil eye or sorcery, but rather caused by accidents of nature. This fascinating place is an essential St Petersburg sight, although not one for the faint-hearted. Think twice about bringing young children here and consider giving the Kunstkamera a wide berth if you are pregnant yourself. Indeed, where else can you see specimens with such charming names as ‘double-faced monster with brain hernia’?
Collected Curiosities
Also part of the museum's enormous collection are some wonderfully kitsch dioramas exhibiting rare objects and demonstrating cultural practices from all over the world. The 3rd floor of the museum is given over to an exhibition about polymath Mikhail Lomonosov, with a recreation of his study-laboratory.

STRELKALANDMARK
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Birzhevaya pl; mVasileostrovskaya)
This eastern tip of Vasilyevsky Island is where Peter the Great wanted his new city’s administrative and intellectual centre to be. In fact, it became the focus of the city's maritime trade, symbolised by the colonnaded Customs House (now the Institute of Russian Literature) and the Old Stock Exchange. The Strelka is flanked by the pair of Rostral Columns, archetypal St Petersburg landmarks.
The Strelka has one of the best views in the city, with the Peter and Paul Fortress to the left and the Hermitage, the Admiralty and St Isaac’s Cathedral to the right.
NOVY MUSEUMGALLERY

This compact contemporary art museum, with galleries on the 3rd and 4th floors, is worth visiting to see all kinds of visual art forms created by a group of 'non-conformist' artists working in the Soviet Union in the latter part of the 20th century. The private collection of over 500 pieces is displayed in exhibitions that change every three months or so.

A must-see if you love retro trams and trolleybuses. A handsome brick shed houses around 20 of these vehicles, both originals and replicas, that used to be more common on St Petersburg's streets. There's also a small art gallery and exhibitions of models, uniforms etc.
On Saturday and Sundays the museum also runs retro tram tours across the city to pl Turgeneva and back via the Petrograd Side; you can hop on or off the tram at any of the stops along the route.

This Whiskey-class Soviet submarine was built in 1954, and – incredibly, once you've looked around inside – served in the Soviet navy until 1990. It has been renovated, repainted and can be visited if a big cruise ship is not docked on the next door Lieutenant Schmidt Passenger Terminal.
Inside, you can see the cramped living quarters and the engine room, look through the still-working periscope and see where the torpedoes were loaded and fired.
UNIVERSITY SCULPTURE GARDENGARDENS

In the midst of the university grounds is a whimsical collection of sculptures from different artists including monuments to figures as disparate as Ho Chi Minh, Vladimir Nabokov, Tomáš Masaryk and Anna Akhmatova. Look out for the one of Major Kovalyov's nose, the character from Gogol's short story The Nose. The leafy central courtyard is a pleasant place to sit, but you may need to show your passport to gain entry.
TWELVE COLLEGESUNIVERSITY
(Двенадцать коллегий MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Mendeleevskaya liniya; mVasileostrovskaya)
Completed in 1744 and marked by a statue of scientist-poet Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–65), the 400m-long Twelve Colleges is one of St Petersburg’s oldest buildings. It was originally meant for Peter’s government ministries, but is now part of the university, which stretches out behind it. Within these walls populist philosopher Nikolai Chernyshevsky studied, Alexander Popov created some of the world’s first radio waves and a young Vladimir Putin earned a degree in law.
This is also where Dmitry Mendeleev invented the periodic table of elements, and the building now contains the small Mendeleev Museum. Also of interest here is the University Sculpture Garden, which can be accessed from the main entrance.
ROSTRAL COLUMNSLANDMARK
(Ростральная колонна MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Birzhevaya pl; mVasileostrovskaya)
The two Rostral Columns, archetypal St Petersburg landmarks, are studded with ships’ prows and four seated sculptures representing four of Russia’s great rivers: the Neva, the Volga, the Dnieper and the Volkhov. These were oil-fired navigation beacons in the 1800s and their gas torches are still lit on some holidays, which makes for a breathtaking sight.
ICEBREAKER KRASINMUSEUM

The Krasin, built in 1917, has a history almost as volatile as the 20th century itself. The Arctic icebreaker was decommissioned in 1971, and can now be visited on a guided tour that leaves every hour on the hour from 11am to 5pm. Call ahead to book a tour in English or French. Special tours of the engine room (over 14s only) are available at 1pm and 3pm on Saturday and Sunday.
The Krasin was captured by the British in 1918, returned to the Soviet Union two years later and took part in a large number of Arctic missions and rescues in her long career. The Krasin is also the last surviving ship of the infamous PQ-15 convoy that sent aid from Britain to the USSR during WWII.
MENSHIKOV PALACEMUSEUM
(Государственный Эрмитаж-Дворец Меншикова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-323 1112; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Universitetskaya nab 15; admission R300; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mVasileostrovskaya)
The first stone building in the city, the Menshikov Palace was built to the grandiose tastes of Prince Alexander Menshikov, Peter the Great’s closest friend and the first governor of St Petersburg. It is now a branch of the Hermitage, and while only a relatively small part of the palace is open to visitors, its interiors are some of the oldest and best preserved in the city.
Menshikov was of humble origins (he is said to have sold pies on the streets of Moscow as a child), but his talent for both organisation and intrigue made him the second-most important person in the Russian Empire by the time of Peter’s death in 1725. His palace, built mainly between 1710 and 1714, was the city’s smartest residence at the time (compare it to Peter the Great’s tiny Summer Palace across the river). Peter used Menshikov's palace for official functions.
The 1st floor displays some stunning Dutch tile work, intended to fortify the rooms against humidity to help ease Menshikov’s tuberculosis. Original furniture and the personal effects of Menshikov are on display and each room has a fact sheet in English explaining its history. Vavara’s Chamber is particularly evocative of how the aristocracy lived during Peter’s time, while the impressive Walnut Study also stands out.
Also of note is the magnificent Grand Hall, where balls and banquets were held, including the infamous reception for Peter's dwarf wedding, in which Peter and his court sniggered as some 70-odd dwarfs from all over Russia attended the wedding and the subsequent drunken party of Peter's favourite dwarf.
RUSSIAN ACADEMY OF FINE ARTS MUSEUMMUSEUM

Art lovers should not bypass the museum of this time-tested institution, which contains work by academy students and faculty dating back to its foundation in 1857. Two 3500-year-old sphinxes guard the entrance of this original location of the academy, where boys would live from the age of five until they graduated at age 15. It was an experiment to create a new species of human: the artist.
For the most part, it worked; many great Russian artists were trained here, including Ilya Repin, Karl Bryullov and Anton Losenko. But the curriculum was designed with the idea that the artist must serve the state, and this conservatism led to a reaction against it. In 1863, 14 students left to found a new movement known as the Wanderers (Peredvizhniki), which went on to revolutionise Russian art.
Nonetheless, the Academy of Arts has many achievements to show off, including numerous studies, drawings and paintings by academy members. On the 3rd floor you can examine the models for the original versions of Smolny Cathedral, St Isaac’s Cathedral and the Alexander Nevsky Monastery. When you enter through the main door take the flight of stairs on your left up to the 2nd floor, where you can buy tickets.
TEMPLE OF THE ASSUMPTIONCHURCH

This stunning 1895 neo-Byzantine church was built by architect Vasily Kosyakov on the site of a former monastery. It was closed during the Soviet period, and in 1957 the building became the city’s first – and very popular – year-round skating rink. The 7.7m, 861kg metal cross on the roof was only replaced in 1998. Following a wonderful renovation, the church is looking superb again; do go inside to see the murals and icons covering the interior.
The church runs a small, pleasant cafe (open 11am to 9pm) next door.

One of the biggest and best of its kind in the world, the Museum of Zoology was founded in 1832 and has some amazing exhibits, including a vast blue whale skeleton that greets you in the first hall. The highlight is unquestionably the stuffed skin of a 44,000-year-old woolly mammoth thawed out of the Siberian ice in 1902. There are also skeletons of a further three mammoths, including two baby ones – all incredible finds.

It ceased to serve its original function following the 1917 revolution and for many years housed the Central Naval Museum. Currently closed, the plan is for this to become a branch of the Hermitage to house the museum's heraldry collection.

Bring your passport with you to access this small but interesting museum, which recounts the history of St Petersburg's metro.

The People’s Will (Narodovolets) D-2 Submarine was one of the first six diesel-fuelled submarines built in the Soviet Union and has been wonderfully preserved in this purpose-built museum. The sub itself saw action between 1931 and 1956, and sank five German ships during WWII. Today you can wander around its supremely well-preserved (yet totally antiquated) interior and look at its equipment and weaponry. There's also a small museum containing photos, models and paintings of other submarines, including the ill-fated Kursk.

This cosy pie shop and cafe was the first in this now nationwide chain. Aptly enough for a cafe that sells Saxon-style pies, it’s located in the heart of St Petersburg’s old German neighbourhood.

Shabby chic has never looked so good as it does at this cafe-bar dedicated to the poet Joseph Brodsky (the name is a pun on buterbrod, the Russian word for sandwich), a super-stylish addition to Vasilyevsky Island's eating and drinking scene. The menu runs from excellent smørrebrød (open sandwiches; from R260) to various set meals of salads and soup.
It's also a great place for a drink as they specialise in home-made fruit-flavoured spirits and have their own very refreshing beer. The decor is particularly cool: Brodsky's (literally) chiselled features stare down on you from where they've been hammered into the cracked old walls, while elements of the historic building have been preserved and gorgeously integrated into the design.

If you're travelling with young children they will love this branch of the Ginza Project–run chain for its colourful, fun design that includes a children's room in the shape of a galleon, parrots in wall niches, an outdoor playground in summer and a real-life menagerie of animals, including a racoon, Clarissa the goat and two rabbits.
Pryanosti & Radosti (Spice and Joy) is around the back of the building, with Moko Burger (run by the same company and serving burgers, Georgian street food and craft beer) facing the street.

To fully take in the contemporary art collection at Erarta will take several hours, so it's handy that the museum's restaurant is a pretty good one that's worth building into your itinerary. The menu is fairly adventurous and includes well-made soups, light dishes such as barley risotto or hand-made truffle pasta, and desserts inspired by works of art.
The restaurant is also open on a Tuesday when the museum is closed.
From Vasileostrovskaya metro station, catch bus 6 or 7 to the museum, or trolleybus 10 or 11 from the opposite side of the road.

Despite the laughable wax figure of a barely recognisable Pushkin with a quill in his hand at the entrance, ‘Peter’s City’ is a classy German restaurant and microbrewery with an impressive menu and cosy decor. There’s a separate bar where you can drink home-brewed lager, Weizen and Dunkel beers, while the menu is all about meat, and particularly sausages.
See if you can manage the metre-long Thüringer, served with onion sauce and red cabbage. Ask also for a free tour of the on-site microbrewery. There's live music Friday and Saturday from 8pm. In summer the outdoor tables offer amazing views of St Isaac’s Cathedral and the Admiralty across the Neva River.

Nearly 20 years on the scene and this excellent place is still going strong. Stylish and airily bright, Restoran is somehow formal and relaxed at the same time. The menu combines the best of haute Russe cuisine with enough modern flair to keep things interesting: try duck baked with apples or whole baked sterlet (a species of sturgeon) in white wine and herbs.
In the winter fires roar, while in the summer the thick stone walls make for an oasis from the heat. Do not miss the superb Napoleon dessert, or the interesting selection of quality Russian wines.

At this upmarket steakhouse you're guaranteed a wide selection of various cuts of prime beef as well as other meats. Or you could keep it lighter with a burger, Greek-style gyros sandwich or (heaven forbid!) a salad. Its stylish, brick-walled subterranean location is a plus.

LENGTH 2KM; TWO HOURS
The eastern nose of Vasilyevsky Island, the 1Strelka, boasts an unparalleled panorama, looking out over the Peter and Paul Fortress, the Hermitage, the Admiralty and St Isaac’s Cathedral. The red 2Rostral Columns frame the view; climb the steps of the 3Old Stock Exchange for a raised perspective.
Continue southwest, dropping into either the 4Museum of Zoology or the 5Kunstkamera, or both. The latter was Russia’s first museum, set up by Peter to dispel common superstitions about illness and disease and includes an infamous collection of deformed foetuses preserved in bottles.
At Peter’s behest, Domenico Trezzini built the magnificent 6Twelve Colleges, now St Petersburg State University, in 1722. The emperor based his bureaucracy here; separate entrances for each ministry signified their independence, while the unified facade highlighted collective goals. Now part of the university, you'll find here the small 7Mendeleev Museum, the beautiful university botanical gardens and a quirky collection of sculptures.
Peter originally gifted the entirety of Vasilyevsky Island to his best friend, Prince Menshikov, who proceeded to build the fabulous 8Menshikov Palace on the north bank of the Bolshaya Neva. Menshikov’s humble origins gave him a taste for opulence, and the interior is the best-preserved Petrine decor in the city.
Two Egyptian sphinx monuments mark the entrance to the institutional 9Academy of Arts Museum, which houses 250 years’ worth of artistic expression. On display are works created by academy students and faculty over the years, as well as temporary exhibitions. A beautiful old library – lined with dusty volumes and packed with dark wood furniture – is open for visiting researchers.
Head inland up 6-ya liniya i 7-ya liniya where you can pop briefly into the aPharmacy Museum of Dr Pelya to view the original 19th-century interior.

Explore Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
Peter’s city was first founded on the Petrograd Side and it's a fascinating place packed with historical sites, stunning Style Moderne architecture and a couple of great live music venues. The showstopper of the area is the Peter & Paul Fortress, whose museums, soaring cathedral and panoramic views easily warrant a half- or a full-day visit. Afterwards, you could easily spend a few days taking in fascinating sights that see far fewer visitors such as the treasure-filled Hermitage Storage Facility, the sprawling Museum of Political History and insightful house museums devoted to the likes of early 20th-century opera singer Chaliapin and Soviet party boss (and Stalinist victim) Kirov.
Aside from hitting the main sights, the Petrograd Side is a fine area for exploring. The main thoroughfare of Bolshoy pr is dotted with shops, restaurants and cafes, and you’ll find intriguing architecture scattered throughout the district. This area is also a fine destination when you need a break from the urban bustle. The wooded islands found here make a great retreat from the city streets, particularly Yelagin where you can hire boats and bicycles, and Krestovsky with its tree-lined lanes and sizeable amusement park.
Local Life
AParks If the weather’s good, join the locals as they take to the Kirovsky Islands for fairground rides, boating, sunbathing and cycling through the woods – it’s a total escape from the city, just three metro stops from the centre.
AStreet Art Check out the creative daubs of street artists on the walls around the shuttered Red Banner Textile Factory and the giant murals near Chkalovskaya metro.
AStrip off Stand next to the serious sunbathers tanning against the fortress walls or on the beach at Zayachy Island. For a year-round tropical holiday, splash around with crowds at Piterland water park.
Getting There & Away
AMetro The Petrograd Side is served by Gorkovskaya and Petrogradskaya on Line 2, and by Sportivnaya, Chkalovskaya and Krestovsky Ostrov on Line 5. The Vyborg Side has some 20 metro stations on it, mainly serving far-flung residential areas.
ABus Bus 10 runs from the Vyborg Side at Chyornaya Rechka, down Bolshoy pr on the Petrograd Side and on into the Historic Heart.
ATram Tram 6 provides a handy link between pl Lenina and Vasilyevsky Island via Kronverksky pr on the Petrograd Side, while tram 40 is also useful for traversing the Petrograd Side to Chyornaya Rechka.
AMarshrutka Marshrutka 346 runs the length of Bolshoy pr and then turns left onto Kamennoostrovsky pr and on to the Vyborg Side.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
This is the real St Petersburg – a far cry from the uniform beauty of the Historic Heart. The Petrograd Side is a good place to see the everyday life of the middle classes in the city and, while the Vyborg Side around pl Lenina is a vision of a post-industrial nightmare, your average Joes live in the Soviet housing estates further along the metro line – travel to the end of lines 1 or 2 and you’ll see real city life.

TOP SIGHT
PETER & PAUL FORTRESS
Housing a cathedral, a former prison and various exhibitions, this large defensive fortress on Zayachy Island is the kernel from which St Petersburg grew into the city it is today. History buffs should definitely schedule a visit here. There are also panoramic views from atop the fortress walls, at the foot of which lies a sandy riverside beach, a prime spot for sunbathing.

The Fortress
Having captured this formerly Swedish settlement on the Neva, Peter set to turn the outpost into a modern Western city, starting with the Peter & Paul Fortress in 1703. It has never been utilised in the city’s defence – unless you count incarceration of political ‘criminals’ as national defence.
Today, the fort makes for a fascinating half-day outing. The main entrance is across the Ioannovsky Bridge at the island's northeast end; there's also access via the Kronwerk Bridge, which is within walking distance of Sportivnaya metro station.
SS Peter & Paul Cathedral
All of Russia's pre-revolutionary rulers from Peter the Great onwards (except Peter II and Ivan VI) are buried inside this cathedral ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R450/250; h10am-7pm Mon, Tue & Thu-Sat, 11am-7pm Sun; mGorkovskaya), which has a magnificent baroque interior quite different from other Orthodox churches. Peter I’s grave is at the front on the right of the iconostasis. In 1998, the remains of Nicholas II and his family – minus Alexey and Maria – were interred in the Chapel of St Catherine, to the right of the entrance.
The 122.5m-high bell tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Ostrov; adult/child R150/90; h11am-5.30pm May-Sep; mGorkovskaya) is the city's second-tallest structure after the television tower. At the base there is a small exhibition about the renovation of the tower in 1997, as well as an up-close inspection of the bell-ringing mechanism. The main reason to climb all these steps, of course, is for the magnificent 360-degree panorama. To ascend, you'll have to join a guided tour (in Russian only), which take place several times a day.
The Trubetskoy Bastion
Evocative use of the original cells for displays about the former political prisoners of Trubetskoy Bastion ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R200/120; h10am-7pm Thu-Mon, to 6pm Tue; mGorkovskaya) – who included the likes of Maxim Gorky, Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Bakunin and Fyodor Dostoevsky – make this the best of the fort's clutch of exhibitions. Short biographies in English of the various inmates are posted on the doors.
Peter the Great's son was tortured to death here and, after the 1917 revolution, the communists continued to use the prison for former aristocrats and counter-revolutionaries until 1924, when it was turned into a museum.
The Commandant’s House & Neva Gate
The fascinating museum in the Commandant's House ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R200/120; h11am-6pm Mon & Thu-Sun, to 5pm Tue; mGorkovksaya) charts the history of the St Petersburg region from medieval times to 1918. What starts as a fairly standard-issue plod through the city’s history really comes alive once you’re upstairs, with modern, interactive exhibits, even though there’s still a lack of explanations in English.
In the south wall is the Neva Gate, a later addition (1787), where prisoners were loaded on boats for execution or exile. Notice the plaques here showing water levels of famous (and obviously devastating) floods. Outside there are fine views of the whole central waterfront, including the Hermitage.
Along the wall, to the left, is the territory of the Walrus Club, the crazy crew that chops a hole in the iced-over Neva each winter so they can take a dip. Swimmers, known as morzhi (walruses), claim the practice eliminates muscle pains, boosts energy and even improves libido. This is not an exclusive club – all are invited to take the plunge!

PETER THE GREAT STATUE

Between the cathedral and the Senior Officers’ Barracks is Mikhail Shemyakin’s Peter the Great statue, which depicts him seated with strangely proportioned head and hands. When the statue was unveiled in 1991 it caused outrage among the city's citizens, for whom Peter remains a saintly figure. Local lore has it that rubbing his right forefinger will bring good luck.
Within the fortress grounds, you can grab a snack at the stolovaya (cafeteria) Leningradskoye Kafe ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; mains R240-360; h10am-8pm Thu-Tue; mGorkovskaya).
A far nicer option is Koryushka, at the southwestern end of Zayachy Island.
POSTERN & NEVA PANORAMA

A separate ticket gains you access to both the Postern, a 97.4m passage hidden in the fortress walls, and the Neva Panorama ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R300/270; h10am-8pm Thu-Tue; mGorkovskaya), a walkway atop the walls, which concludes at Naryshkin Bastion. Every day at noon a cannon is fired from here, a tradition dating back to Peter the Great's times.

The elegant Style Moderne Kshesinskaya Palace (1904) is a highly appropriate location for this excellent museum – one of the city's best – covering Russian politics in scrupulous detail up to contemporary times.
The palace, previously the home of Mathilda Kshesinskaya, famous ballet dancer and one-time lover of Nicholas II in his pre-tsar days, was briefly the headquarters of the Bolsheviks, and Lenin often gave speeches from the balcony.
You could spend hours exploring this museum (indeed there are two separate audio guides for the sprawling collection). Don't miss the portrait of Nicholas II, which shows the bayonet cuts made by soldiers during his night of capture on 26 October 1917. Photos show some of the horrors of the Soviet days, including 1933 street scenes in Ukraine, with the streets sprinkled with those who had died of starvation – owing to Stalin's policies. The Lenin memorial room is unchanged since Soviet days, with an almost religious atmosphere. You can visit Lenin’s one-time office where he worked between the February and October Revolutions.
LEUCHTENBERG HOUSENOTABLE BUILDING

The Style Moderne gem Leuchtenberg House is so called because it once belonged to the Duke of Leuchtenberg, great-grandson of Tsar Nicholas I.

(Музей Кирова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kirovmuseum.ru; Kamennoostrovsky pr 26/28; adult/child R150/100; h11am-6pm Thu-Tue; mPetrogradskaya)
Leningrad party boss Sergei Kirov was one of the most powerful men in Russia in the early 1930s. His decidedly un-proletarian apartment is now a fascinating museum showing how the Bolshevik elite really lived: take a quick journey back to the days of Soviet glory, including choice examples of 1920s technology, such as the first-ever Soviet-produced typewriter and a conspicuously noncommunist GE fridge, complete with plastic food inside.
Many of Kirov’s personal items are on display and his office from the Smolny Institute has been fully reconstructed in one of the rooms. Kirov lived for 10 years at this flat until his murder at Stalin’s behest in 1934, which sparked a wave of deadly repression in the country.
The floor above the Kirov collection has a recreated school room and shows what life was like for children in the 1930s. The 'boy's room' contains actual childhood objects belonging to Eugeny Porsin (including a cheery watercolour he painted), who was born in 1925, and was later drafted to serve in WWII. He died from wounds sustained near Vienna just 10 days before the end of fighting.
PETER’S CABINHISTORIC BUILDING
(Домик Петра Великого MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Petrovskaya nab 6; adult/student R200/100; h10am-6pm Wed & Fri-Mon, 1-9pm Thu; mGorkovskaya)
This charming log cottage, protected within a stone building, is St Petersburg’s oldest surviving structure. The wooden cabin itself was supposedly built in three days in May 1703 for Peter to live in while he supervised the construction of the fortress and city.
Feeling more like a shrine than a museum, the cabin confirms Peter’s love for the simple life with its unpretentious, homely feel, visibly influenced by the time he spent in Holland.
It has long been a sentimental site for St Petersburg. During WWII, Soviet soldiers would take an oath of allegiance to the city here, vowing to protect it from the Germans, before disappearing to the front. After the Siege of Leningrad, this was the first museum to reopen to the public.
Look out for the bronze bust of Peter by Parmen Zabello in the garden.
ALEXANDROVSKY PARKPARK
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; c; mGorkovskaya)
This leafy park, laid out in 1845, wraps in an arc around the Kronwerk moat and Artillery Museum. It's too close to traffic to ensure a peaceful escape but, if you have kids in tow, it harbours a few attractions worth considering, the best of which is the Planetarium, offering shows throughout the day, an observatory and several different display halls.
Also inside the park is Mini St Petersburg – miniature sculptures of the city's key landmarks that make for a fun photo opportunity.

Opera buffs will want to visit this house–museum where the great singer Fyodor Chaliapin (1873–1938) lived before fleeing the Soviet Union in 1922.

Also known as the House of Matyushin, this small museum occupies a charming grey-painted wooden cottage dating from the mid-19th century that was once the home of avant-garde artist Mikhail Matyushin (1861–1934). The exhibition here relates to Matyushin’s work and that of his coterie. Entrance is free on Fridays.

On eastern Aptekarsky (Apothecary) Island, this was once a garden of medicinal plants – founded by Peter the Great himself in 1714 – that gave the island its name. Today the botanical gardens contain 26 greenhouses on a 22-hectare site. It is a lovely place to stroll around, and a fascinating place to visit – and not just for botanists.
At the turn of the 20th century, these were the second-biggest botanical gardens in the world, behind London’s Kew Gardens. However, 90% of the plants died during WWII, which makes the present collection all the more impressive (you will recognise the ‘veterans’ by their war medals).
A highlight is the tsaritsa nochi (Selenicereus pteranthus), a flowering cactus that blossoms only one night a year, usually in mid-June. On this night, the gardens stay open until morning for visitors to gawk at the marvel and sip champagne.
Entry to the gardens is on the corner of Aptekarsky per and nab reki Karpovki. Although the grounds close from October to April, the greenhouses are open all year, with visits by guided tour (in Russian) only.
YELIZAROV MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей-квартира Елизаровых MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-235 3778; ul Lenina 52, flat 24; adult/student R250/120; h10am-6pm Thu-Sun, 1-9pm Wed; mChkalovskaya)
Lenin’s wife’s family lived in this apartment-turned-museum and VIadimir Ilyich himself laid low here before the revolution while organising the workers. The delightful turn-of-the-20th-century fittings have been preserved intact, including a telephone that still bears Lenin’s home phone number. By the look of things, Lenin had a very bourgeois time of it.
The apartment building, which is known locally as the ‘boat house’ due to its external similarities to a large cruise liner, was built in 1913 at the height of St Petersburg’s lust for Style Moderne. After finding the entrance, head up the stairs to the 3rd floor to be buzzed in.
CRUISER AURORAMUSEUM
(Крейсер Аврора MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-230 8440; www.aurora.org.ru; Petrovskaya nab; adult/child R600/400; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun; c; mGorkovskaya)
Moored on the Bolshaya Nevka, the Aurora had a walk-on part in the communist revolution. On the night of 25 October 1917, its crew fired a blank round from the forward gun as a signal for the start of the assault on the Winter Palace. Restored and painted in pretty colours, it’s a living museum that swarms with kids on weekends.
Launched in 1901, the Aurora saw action in the Russo-Japanese War and was sunk by German bombs in WWII. Inside you can view the crew's quarters as well as communist propaganda and a collection of friendship banners from around the world.
MOSQUEMOSQUE
(Соборная мечеть MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %821-233 9819; http://dum-spb.ru/kontakty; Kronverksky pr 7; h7am-9pm; mGorkovskaya)
This beautiful working mosque (built 1910–14) was modelled on Samarkand’s Gur-e Amir Mausoleum. Its fluted azure dome and minarets are stunning and surprisingly prominent in the city’s skyline. Outside of prayer times, if you are respectfully dressed (women should wear a head covering, men long trousers), you can walk through the gate at the northeast side and ask the guard for entry – the interior is equally lovely.
If you are allowed in, remove your shoes, do not talk and do not take photos.
ARTILLERY MUSEUMMUSEUM

Housed in the fort’s original arsenal, across the moat from the Peter & Paul Fortress, this fire-powered museum chronicles Russia’s military history, with examples of weapons dating all the way back to the Stone Age. The centrepiece is Lenin’s armoured car, which he rode in triumph from the Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal).
Even if you are not impressed by guns and bombs, who can resist climbing around on the tanks and trucks that adorn the courtyard?
CHAEV MANSIONARCHITECTURE

(Музей хлеба MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://muzei-xleb.ru; ul Mikhailova 2; adult/student R150/100; h10am-6pm Tue-Sat; mPloshchad Lenina)
This quirky little museum pays tribute to bread and the role it has played in history (of the city and of the world). A model bakery exhibits the equipment that was used to make bread for the city’s poorest classes in the 19th century. A special exhibition on the Siege of Leningrad offers a chilling example of a daily ration of bread during WWII, as well as rare photographs of starving children and bread queues.
The museum's new location is a short stroll from Pl Lenina.
TOY MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей игрушки MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Karpovki 32; adult/child R300/100; h11am-6pm Tue-Sun; mPetrogradskaya)
This privately run museum presents its pan-Russian collection in three sections – folk toys, factory toys and artisanal toys. Examples of the last include toys made in Sergiev Posad, home of the ubiquitous matryoshka (nesting doll), a creation often assumed to be far older than it is, being created for the first time only in the 19th century.
At the time of research, the museum was closed for renovations.

This odd conceptual exhibition, based on abstractions and ideas, not artefacts, is an outgrowth of the Psychoanalytic Institute that houses it. The two-room exhibition aims to stimulate your subconscious as you struggle to read the display symbolising what Freud himself would have dreamt. Illustrations of Freud’s patients’ dreams and quotations line the dimly lit, incense-scented hall. English is spoken.

Architectural Tour of Petrograd Side

START PETER & PAUL FORTRESS (GORKOVSKAYA)
END ROSENSHTEIN APARTMENT BUILDING (PETROGRADSKAYA)
LENGTH 1.5KM; TWO HOURS
The Petrograd Side is an architectural treasure trove with buildings ranging from the time of St Petersburg's very inception up to contemporary times. Start with a quick tour of the city’s first defensive installation, the 1Peter & Paul Fortress. Don't miss the splendid 2SS Peter & Paul Cathedral, the last resting place of Peter the Great and almost every tsar since.
The central square of Peter’s early city, 3Troitskaya pl (Trinity Sq) formerly had as its centrepiece Trinity Cathedral, where Peter attended Mass. The cathedral was destroyed soon after the 1917 revolution but a small chapel remains on the spot.
Petrovskaya nab is home to two historic landmarks: 4Peter’s Cabin, the wooden hut that was the tsar's first modest home in the city; and, off the island’s eastern tip, the 5Cruiser Aurora, a legendary battleship which saw service in the Russo‑Japanese War.
Return to Kamennoostrovsky pr via ul Kuybysheva, passing the lovely Style Moderne palace of ballerina Mathilda Kshesinskaya that now houses the 6Museum of Political History, and the 7Mosque, coated in dazzling mosaics of aquatint tiles.
Continue north along Kamennoostrovsky pr to get a sense of Petrograd’s ever-growing vibrancy. Look closely for architectural gems around 8Avstriyskaya pl, with its castlelike edifices. Further along, if you want to get an idea of what one of these grand Style Moderne apartment blocks looks like inside, visit the 9Kirov Museum.
Ul Rentgena offers up more Style Moderne beauties: note the decoration on the facade of No 4 and make sure you do a full circle of the freestanding aChaev Mansion, which exhibits great geometric precision in its design.
Follow ul Lva Tolstogo towards the metro and you'll pass the whimsical, turretted bRosenshtein Apartment Building (also know as the Tower House). Designed by Andrey Belogrud, this mash-up of neoclassical and neo-Gothic styles now houses a theatre.
1Kirovsky Islands
This is the collective name for the three outer delta islands of the Petrograd Side – Kamenny, Yelagin and Krestovsky. Once marshy forests, the islands were granted to 18th- and 19th-century court favourites and developed into elegant playgrounds. Still mostly parkland, they are leafy venues for picnics, river sports and White Nights’ cavorting, as well as home to St Petersburg’s super rich.
The metro station Krestovsky Ostrov provides easy access to both Krestovsky and Yelagin Islands; for Kamenny you can walk across the bridge from metro station Chyornaya Rechka on the Vyborg Side.
Yelagin Island
This island is one giant park, free of traffic and a serene place to wander. It was attractively landscaped by the architect Carlo Rossi and its centrepiece, also by Rossi, is the beautifully restored Yelagin Palace ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://elaginpark.org; Yelagin ostrov 1; h10am-6pm; mKrestovsky Ostrov), which Alexander I commissioned for his mother, Empress Maria. The gorgeous interiors, with detailed murals and incredible inlaid-wood floors, are furnished with antiques. Unfortunately, the palace remains closed for long-term renovations.
Other nearby estate buildings host temporary exhibitions, too. The rest of the island is a lovely network of paths, greenery, lakes and channels. At the northern end of the island, you can rent row boats to explore the ponds or in-line skates to explore the paths; in winter it’s an ideal setting for sledding, skiing and skating. At the west end, a plaza looks out to the Gulf of Finland: sunsets are resplendent from here.
KAMENNY ISLANDISLAND
(Каменный остров MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mChyornaya Rechka)
Century-old dacha (country cottages) and mansions, inhabited by very wealthy locals, line the wooded lanes that twist their way around Kamenny (Stone) Island. The island is punctuated by a series of canals, lakes and ponds, and is pleasant for strolling at any time of year. At its east end, the Church of St John the Baptist (built 1776–81) has been charmingly restored.
Behind it, Catherine the Great built the big, classical Kamennoostrovsky Palace ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) for her son; unfortunately it's visible only from the outside.
For years a dead oak, supposedly planted by Peter the Great, stood in the middle of the Krestovka embankment. The old oak has been removed and replaced with a young, healthy tree, but it is still known as Peter’s Tree.
CHURCH OF ST JOHN THE BAPTISTCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Kamennoostrovsky pr; h9am-6pm)
An elegant red-brick church built in the 18th century.
PETER'S TREELANDMARK
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
According to legend Kamenny Island was the site where Peter the Great planted an oak tree, which stood proudly over many years. The old oak, however, died and has since been replaced with a young, healthy tree; nevertheless, it is still known as Peter’s Tree.
KRESTOVSKY ISLANDISLAND
(Крестовский остров GOOGLE MAP ; c; mKrestovsky Ostrov)
The biggest of the three northern islands, Krestovsky consists mostly of the vast Maritime Victory Park, dotted with sports fields; at the far western end is the massive, 68,000-seat Krestovsky Stadium, which will play a pivotal role in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
At the main entrance opposite the metro station you can rent bikes and in-line skates. Also here is Divo Ostrov, a Disney-style amusement park with exciting fairground rides that kids will adore.
MARITIME VICTORY PARKPARK

TOP SIGHT
HERMITAGE STORAGE FACILITY
Guided tours of the Hermitage’s state-of-the-art restoration and storage facility are highly recommended. This is not a formal exhibition as such, but the guides are knowledgeable and the examples chosen for display (paintings, furniture and carriages) are wonderful.
The storage facility is directly behind the big shopping centre opposite the metro station – look for the enormous golden-yellow glass facility decorated with shapes inspired by petroglyphs.
The highlight is undoubtedly the gorgeous 17-part ceremonial tent presented to Alexander III by the Emir of Bukhara in 1893. Other treasures include an embroidered Turkish tent, presented to Catherine the Great by the Sultan Selim III one century earlier. Beside it stands an equally impressive modern diplomatic gift: a massive woodcarving of the mythical garuda bird, given by Indonesia to the city for its 300th anniversary. Another section contains gorgeous pieces from the imperial wardrobe, including the wedding gown worn by Alexandra Feodorovna (Nicholas II's wife) and dresses worn by their daughters Tatiana and Olga, Russia's last tsarinas.
Other notable displays are of ancient Russian icons and frescoes; selections from the collection of 3500 canvases by Russian artists down the ages; a hall of imperial carriages; and a depository stacked with all kinds of furniture – a veritable imperial IKEA!
Call ahead to reserve a tour in English.

SAMPSONIEVSKY CATHEDRALCATHEDRAL
(Сампсониевский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshoy Sampsonievsky pr 41; h9am-6pm; mVyborgskaya)
This light-blue baroque cathedral dates from 1740, and having been repainted and restored to its original glory both inside and out, glistens like a pearl amid a gritty industrial area. Its most interesting feature is the calendar of saints, two enormous panels on either side of the nave, each representing six months of the year, where every day is decorated with a mini-icon of its saint(s).
The enormous silver chandelier above the altar is also something to behold, as is the stunning baroque, green-and-golden iconostasis. Don’t miss the frieze of a young Peter the Great, on the wall behind you when you face the main iconostasis.
This is also believed to be the church where Catherine the Great married her one-eyed lover Grigory Potemkin in a secret ceremony in 1774.
BUDDHIST TEMPLETEMPLE
(Буддистский Храм MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %981-755 9605; www.dazan.spb.ru; Primorsky pr 91; h10am-6pm Mon-Fri, to 7pm Sat & Sun; mStaraya Derevnya)
Another in the city's collection of grand religious buildings is this beautiful functioning datsan (temple) where respectful visitors are welcome. The main prayer hall has lovely mosaic decoration and there's a cheap and cheerful cafe in the basement. The temple was built between 1909 and 1915 at the instigation of Pyotr Badmaev, a Buddhist physician to Tsar Nicholas II.
Money was raised from all over Russia, and as far afield as Thailand and England, by various Buddhist organisations; it even gained the support of the Dalai Lama in Lhasa.
In the 1930s the communists shut the temple, arrested many of the monks and used the building as a military radio station. In the 1960s it was taken over by the Zoological Institute and used as laboratories. Thankfully, however, the damage was not particularly profound and the datsan was returned to the city’s small Buddhist community in 1990.
PISKARYOVSKOE CEMETERYCEMETERY
(Пискарёвское мемориальное кладбище GOOGLE MAP ; www.pmemorial.ru; pr Nepokoryonnikh 72; h9am-9pm May-Oct, to 6pm Nov-Apr; mPloshchad Muzhestva)
The main burial place for the victims of the Nazi blockade in WWII is a stark and poignant memorial to the tragedy. Some half a million people were laid to rest here between 1941 and 1943, during the siege.
From metro station Ploshchad Muzhestva, take marshrutka 123 in the direction of Ladozhskaya metro, which passes by the entrance to the cemetery.
Originally, this area was just an enormous pit where unnamed and unmarked bodies were dumped. In 1960 the remodelled cemetery was opened and has been an integral part of the city’s soul ever since. Every year on Victory Day (9 May) the cemetery is packed out with mourners, many of whom survived the blockade or lost close relatives to starvation.
FINLAND STATIONHISTORIC BUILDING
(Finlyandsky vokzal; Финляндский вокзал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Lenina 6; mPloshchad Lenina)
Rebuilt in the 1970s in rectilinear Soviet style, the Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal) endures as a place of historical significance, where Lenin finally arrived in 1917 after 17 years in exile abroad. Here he gave his legendary speech from the top of an armoured car to a crowd who had heard of, but never seen, the man.
After fleeing a second time he again arrived here from Finland, this time disguised as a railway fireman, and the locomotive he rode in is displayed behind glass on the platform.
Walk out onto the square that still bears Lenin’s name and you’ll see a marvellous statue of the man himself at the far end.
SITE OF PUSHKIN’S DUELHISTORIC SITE
(Место дуэли Пушкина GOOGLE MAP ; Kolomyazhsky pr; mChyornaya Rechka)
Russia’s poetic genius, Alexander Pushkin, was fatally wounded in a duel here with the Frenchman Georges d’Anthès on 8 February 1837. A granite monument marks the alleged spot, today a small park surrounded by fast-moving traffic.
From the metro station at Chyornaya Rechka, walk down Torzhkovskaya ul and turn left at the first light on Novosibirskaya ul. Walk straight to the end of the road, cross the train tracks and enter the park.

It's well worth the effort making the trip out to see this magnificent collection of street art set inside a former 11-hectare industrial site. You'll find a wide variety of formats, from huge murals covering walls to mixed-media installations set inside a former boilerhouse. Every year, the exhibition changes, with top artists from around the globe invited to contribute on themes like Revolution (featured in 2017 on the 100-year anniversary of Russia's October Revolution), Migrants and Peace.
Intriguingly, parts of this industrial complex are still active, with workers at the laminated plastics factory SLOPAST surrounded by the encroaching artwork. Some of the workshops are decorated with epic works by the likes of top Russian street artists Timothy Radya, Kirill Kto and Nikita Nomerz, as well as the Spanish artist Escif. Before he died in 2013, Pasha 183 – frequently referred to as Russia's Banksy because of his anonymity – also contributed 'Walls Don't Sleep', a beautiful monochrome mural based on an image of Soviet factory workers.
Guided tours take place on weekends (at 1pm and 2pm); call ahead to ensure an English-speaking guide is on hand. The museum also hosts outdoor concerts and other big events. Check the website for the latest.
It's located in the industrial zone of Okhta, a 20-minute bus ride east of Ploshchad Lenina. Buses 28, 37 and 137 all go there.

This treasure trove of Soviet ephemera, pre-revolutionary antiques, WWII artefacts and bonkers kitsch from all eras is truly worth travelling for. Exit the metro station to the right and follow the crowds across the train tracks. Continue beyond the large permanent market, which is of very little interest, until you come to a huge area of independent stalls, all varying in quality and content.
The sheer size of the place means you’ll really have to comb it to find the gems.

One of the city’s best bani is opposite the metro; look for the round building across the grassy traffic island. Rates at the communal baths rise towards the weekend. The luxe baths (only open to women on Wednesday and Saturday) also grant you access to the heated circular open-air pool. There are private facilities, too.
1METRO ART
Beautiful interior design is not just for palaces and galleries in St Petersburg – it is also found across the city’s metro system. Red Line 1, the first to be opened in 1955, is particularly striking for its station designs, but other newer stations also have artistic flourishes.

Day Trips from St Petersburg

Peterhof
The most popular day trip from St Petersburg is to Peter the Great’s spectacular summer palace and grounds on the Gulf of Finland, easily reached from central St Petersburg by hydrofoil from outside the Admiralty.
Pushkin & Pavlovsk
Tsarskoe Selo (in the town of Pushkin) and Pavlovsk are two beautiful palaces and grounds next door to one another. This is a great day trip to see the summer palaces of Catherine the Great and Paul I.
Vyborg
Situated on the Gulf of Finland, this appealing town is features a medieval castle and an abundance of art-nouveau buildings. An easy day trip from St Petersburg, Vyborg offers enough for longer stays.
Repino
Part of Finland in the mid-20th-century, this village has long back in Russian hands and makes for a pleasant, outdoorsy day trip from St Petersburg.
Kronshtadt
Closed to foreigners until 1996, Kronshtadt's offering of history, cruises and naval might makes for a fascinating day trip destination.


TOP SIGHT
PETERHOF
The fountains are incredible, the palace is a stunner and the grounds are great for walking, so it’s no surprise that Peter the Great’s summer palace is usually the first-choice day trip for visitors to St Petersburg. Peterhof is no secret, however, so come early in the day or out of season to enjoy it without the crowds.

Peter's Summer Palace
Hugging the Gulf of Finland, 29km west of St Petersburg, Peterhof – the ‘Russian Versailles’ – is a far cry from the original cabin Peter the Great had built here to oversee construction of the Kronshtadt naval base. Peter liked the place so much he built a villa, Monplaisir, here and then a whole series of palaces and ornate gardens. Peterhof was renamed Petrodvorets (Peter’s Palace) in 1944 but has since reverted to its original name. The palace and buildings are surrounded by leafy gardens and a spectacular ensemble of gravity-powered fountains.
What you see today is largely a reconstruction, as Peterhof was a major casualty of WWII. Apart from the damage done by the Germans, the palace suffered the worst under Soviet bombing raids in December 1941 and January 1942, because Stalin was determined to thwart Hitler’s plan of hosting a New Year’s victory celebration here.
The Lower Park
The Lower Park contains most of Peterhof’s sights and is where you will arrive if you take the hydrofoil from St Petersburg to get here. Forming the lion’s share of the palace grounds, it boasts an incredible symphony of gravity-powered golden fountains, beautiful waterways and interesting historical buildings, making it one of St Petersburg’s most dazzling attractions.
Criss-crossed by bridges and bedecked by smaller sprays, Water Avenue ( GOOGLE MAP ; hMay-Sep) is a canal leading from the hydrofoil dock to the palace. It culminates in the magnificent Grand Cascade, a symphony of over 140 fountains engineered in part by Peter himself. The central statue of Samson tearing open a lion’s jaws celebrates – as so many things in St Petersburg do – Peter’s victory over the Swedes at Poltava. Shooting up 62m, it was unveiled by Rastrelli for the 25th anniversary of the battle in 1735.
Grand Palace
The Grand Palace is an imposing edifice, although with 30-something rooms, it’s not as large as many tsarist palaces. From the start of June to the end of September foreign tourists can visit only between 10.30am and noon, and again from 2.30pm until 4.15pm, due to guided tours being given only in Russian at other times. (While you have to enter the palace as part of a guided tour, it’s quite possible to slip away.)
While Peter’s palace was relatively modest, Rastrelli grossly enlarged the building for Empress Elizabeth. Later, Catherine the Great toned things down a little with a redecoration, although that’s not really apparent from the glittering halls and art-filled galleries that are here today. All of the paintings, furniture and chandeliers are original, as everything was removed from the premises before the Germans arrived in WWII. The Chesme Hall is full of huge paintings of Russia’s destruction of the Turkish fleet at Çesme in 1770. Other highlights include the exquisite East and West Chinese Cabinets, Peter’s study and the Picture Hall, which lives up to its name, with hundreds of portraits crowding its walls. The Throne Room is the biggest in the palace, and the centrepiece is Peter’s red velvet throne.
After WWII, Peterhof was largely left in ruins. Hitler had intended to throw a party here when his plans to occupy the Astoria Hotel were thwarted. He drew up pompous invitations, which obviously incensed his Soviet foes. Stalin’s response was to preempt any such celebration by bombing the estate himself, in the winter of 1941–42, so it is ironic but true that most of the damage at Peterhof occurred at the hands of the Soviets.
Monplaisir
This far more humble, sea-facing villa was always Peter the Great’s favourite retreat. It’s easy to see why: Monplaisir (Монплезир GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm late May-early Oct) is wood panelled, snug and elegant, peaceful even when there’s a crowd – which there used to be all the time, what with Peter’s mandatory partying (‘misbehaving’ guests were required to gulp down huge quantities of wine).
Also in this complex is an annexe called the Catherine Building (Екатерининский корпус GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm), which was built by Rastrelli between 1747 and 1755. Its name derives from the fact that Catherine the Great was living in this building when her husband Peter III was overthrown,and it was from here that she set out for the capital to assume the Russian throne. The interior contains the bedroom and study of Alexander I, as well as the huge Yellow Hall. On the right side is the magnificent Bath Building (Банный корпус GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Thu-Tue), built by Quarenghi in 1800, which is nothing special inside.Look out for some more trick fountains in the garden in front of the buildings.

Hermitage
Along the shore to the west, the 1725 Hermitage (Эрмитаж GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R400/250; h10.30am-6pm Wed-Mon May-Oct) is a two-storey yellow-and-white box featuring the ultimate in private dining: special elevators hoist a fully laid table into the imperial presence on the 2nd floor, thereby eliminating any hindrance by servants. The elevators are circular and located directly in front of each diner, whose plate would be lowered, replenished and replaced. The device is demonstrated on Saturdays and Sundays at 1pm, 2pm and 3pm. Further west is yet another palace, Marly, inspired by the Versailles hunting lodge of the same name so loved by Louis XIV.

Park Alexandria
Even on summer weekends, the rambling and overgrown Park Alexandria (Парк Александрия GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R300/200; h9am-10pm) is peaceful and practically empty. Built for Tsar Nicholas I (and named for his tsarina), these grounds offer a sweet retreat from the crowds. Originally named for Alexander Nevsky, the gothic chapel ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R300/200; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun) was completed in 1834 as the private chapel of Nicholas I. Nearby is the cottage (Коттедж GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun) that was built around the same time as his summer residence. Also part of this same ensemble is the beautifully restored Farmer’s Palace (Фермерский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R600/350; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun), built here in 1831 as a pavilion in the park and designed to reify pastoral fantasies of rural life for the royal family. It became the home of the teenage Tsarevitch Alexander (later Alexander II), who loved it throughout his life.
Peterhof Town
Outside the palace grounds is the handsome St Peter & Paul Cathedral (Петропавловский собор GOOGLE MAP ; Sankt-Petersburgsky pr; h9am-7pm), and, continuing around the edge of Olgin Prud (Olga’s Pond), the Tsaritsyn and Olgin Pavilions ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R700/400; h10.30am-6pm, last entry 4pm), two buildings sitting on islands in the middle of the pond. Nicholas I had these elaborate pavilions built for his wife (Alexandra Fyodorovna) and daughter (Olga Nikolayevna) respectively. Only recently restored and reopened, they boast unique Mediterranean architectural styles reminiscent of Pompeii.
Further down Sankt-Petersburgsky pr is the Raketa Petrodvorets Watch Factory ( GOOGLE MAP ; %926-304 05 91; www.raketa.com; Sankt-Petersburgsky pr 60; h9am-6pm Mon-Fri), one of the town’s biggest employers, which has an on-site shop selling very cool watches.
TICKETS FOR PETERHOF

On arrival, you’ll need to pay to enter the grounds of the palace, known as the Lower Park, and then for each additional sight within it. Sadly, however, it’s not cheap, as you’re paying more than locals and the sights add up, so choose what you want to see carefully. Inexplicably, many museums also have different closing days, although all buildings are open Friday to Sunday. Nearly all tours and posted information are in Russian, so buy an information booklet at the kiosks near the entrances or, in the Grand Palace, take an English-language audio guide. Online tickets can be purchased for the Grand Palace at www.peterhofmuseum.ru, which can avoid long lines in the summer months.
HYDROFOIL

From May to September, the Peterhof Express ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhof-express.com; single/return adult R800/1500, student R600/1000; h10am-6pm) hydrofoil departs from the jetty in front of the Admiralty every 30 minutes from 9am. It’s an expensive but highly enjoyable way to get to Peterhof, and you arrive right in front of the palace. The last hydrofoil leaves Peterhof at 7pm, and the trip takes 30 minutes.
Even though the hydrofoil is fast and convenient, it’s rather expensive. You can save money by getting here by marshrutka. Marshrutky 300,424 and 424A (R80) leave from outside the Avtovo metro station. All pass through the town of Peterhof, immediately outside the palace. Tell the driver you want to go ‘v dvaryéts’ (‘to the palace’) and you’ll be let off near the main entrance to the Upper Garden, on Sankt-Petersburgsky pr.
TRAIN

There’s also a reasonably frequent suburban train (R60, 40 minutes) from Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) to Novy Peterhof, from where you can walk (around 30 minutes) or take any bus except 357 to the fifth stop, which will take another 10 minutes.
NEED TO KNOW

Peterhof is 29km west of St Petersburg.
In the Lower Park itself, the best eating options are the Grand Orangerie ( GOOGLE MAP ; Lower Park; set menus R450-800; h11am-8pm), a cafe in the former palace orangery, or the Shtandart Restaurant (Ресторан Штандарт GOOGLE MAP ; www.restaurantshtandart.spb.ru; Lower Park; mains R590-1300; h11am-8pm), a bigger place with a terrace and views towards the Gulf of Finland. Outside the palace grounds, try the appealing Duck & Drake inside the New Peterhof Hotel ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-319 1010; www.new-peterhof.com; Sankt Peterburgsky pr 34; s/d from R5000/5900; Ws), where you can eat Russian and European fare (mains R520 to R950).
TOP TIP

Remember to bring mosquito repellent or to keep your legs and arms covered if you’re here during summer; the mosquitoes on the palace grounds are fierce.

TOP SIGHT
PUSHKIN & PAVLOVSK
The sumptuous palaces and sprawling parks at Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk are, thanks to Catherine the Great and Pushkin, entrenched in Russian history and immortalised in literature. These two neighbouring complexes can be combined in a day’s visit – although if you’re not in the mood to rush, there is plenty at both of them to keep you entertained for an entire day.

The Parks
Almost adjacent yet very different in style and design, Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk are both huge imperial estates with impressive gardens, palaces and various other embellishments. Both also have towns that have grown up around them over the centuries. (The town surrounding Tsarskoe Selo was originally called Tsarskoe Selo, too, but changed its name to Pushkin in 1937.)
Tsarskoe Selo (the ‘tsar’s village’) is understandably the big hitter of the two thanks to the beautiful Catherine Palace and its sumptuous grounds. Pavlovsk, just a short bus ride away, is far less visited and much quieter as a result, but its grounds are wilder and arguably even more lovely, and make for a perfect place to get lost in.
Catherine Palace
The centrepiece of Tsarskoe Selo, created under Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine the Great between 1744 and 1796, is the vast baroque Catherine Palace (Екатерининский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; www.tzar.ru; Sadovaya ul 7; adult/student R1000/350, audio guide R150; h10am-4.45pm Wed-Sun), designed by Rastrelli and named after Peter the Great’s second wife. From May to September the palace can only be visited by individuals between noon and 2pm and 4pm and 5pm, otherwise it’s reserved for prebooked tour groups, such is its rightful popularity. The audio guide is well worth taking, as it gives detailed explanations of what you’ll see in each room.
As at the Winter Palace, Catherine the Great had many of Rastrelli’s original interiors remodelled in classical style. Most of the gaudy exterior and 20-odd rooms of the palace have been beautifully restored – compare them to the photographs of the devastation left by the Germans.
The interiors are superb, with highlights including the Great Hall, the Arabesque Hall, the baroque Cavalier’s Dining Room, the White State Dining Room, the Crimson and Green Pilaster Rooms, the Portrait Hall and, of course, the world-famous Amber Room. The panels used in the Amber Room were a gift given to Peter the Great, but not put to any use until 1743 when Elizabeth decided to use them decoratively, after which they were ingeniously incorporated into the walls here. What you see is a reconstruction of the original that disappeared during WWII and is believed to have been destroyed.
Catherine Park
The lovely Catherine Park (Екатерининский парк GOOGLE MAP ; May-Sep R120, Oct-Apr free; h9am-6pm), with its main entrance on Sadovaya ul next to the palace chapel, surrounds the Catherine Palace. It extends around the ornamental Great Pond and contains an array of interesting buildings, follies and pavilions. Near the Catherine Palace, the Cameron Gallery has rotating exhibitions. The park’s outer section focuses on the Great Pond. In summer you can take a ferry boat to the little island to visit the Chesme Column ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R250/150; h11am-6pm May-Sep), a monument to Russia’s victory over the Turkish fleet. Beside the pond, the blue baroque Grotto Pavilion ( GOOGLE MAP ; h10am-5pm Fri-Wed) houses temporary exhibitions in summer. A walk around the Great Pond will reveal other buildings that the royals built over the years, including the very incongruous-looking Turkish Bath with its minaret-style tower, the wonderful Marble Bridge, the Chinese Pavilion and a Concert Hall isolated on an island.
Alexander Palace & Park
A short distance north of the Catherine Palace, and surrounded by the overgrown and tranquil Alexander Park (Александровский парк GOOGLE MAP ; h7am-11pm), is the classical Alexander Palace (Александровский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovaya ul 2). This palace, built by Quarenghi between 1792 and 1796 for the future Alexander I, was the favourite residence of Nicholas II, the last Russian tsar. Only a few rooms are open to visitors, but they’re impressive, with a huge tiger-skin carpet and an extremely ropey portrait of a young Queen Victoria to boot. It’s a poignant and forgotten place that doesn’t get many tourists and is a welcome contrast to the Catherine Palace.
Pavlovsk Great Palace
Between 1781 and 1786, on orders from Catherine the Great, architect Charles Cameron designed the Pavlovsk Great Palace (Большой Павловский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; www.pavlovskmuseum.ru; ul Sadovaya 20; adult/child R600/250; h10am-6pm, closed Tue, Fri & 1st Mon of month) in Pavlovsk. The palace was designated for Catherine’s son Paul (hence the name, Pavlovsk), and it was Paul’s second wife, Maria Fyodorovna, who orchestrated the design of the interiors. Tragically, the original palace was burnt down two weeks after the end of WWII when the cigarette of a careless Soviet soldier set off German mines (the Soviets blamed the Germans). As at Tsarskoe Selo, the restoration is remarkable.
The finest rooms are on the middle floor of the central block. Cameron designed the round Italian Hall beneath the dome and the Grecian Hall to its west, though the lovely green fluted columns were added by his assistant, Vincenzo Brenna. Flanking these are two private suites designed mainly by Brenna: Paul’s along the north side of the block and Maria Fyodorovna’s on the south. The Hall of War of the insane, military-obsessed Paul contrasts with Maria’s Hall of Peace, decorated with musical instruments and flowers. On the middle floor of the south block are Paul’s Throne Room and the Hall of the Maltese Knights of St John, of whom he was the Grand Master.

Pavlovsk Great Park
If you decide to skip the palace, you may simply wish to wander around the serene Pavlovsk Great Park – and as you’ll have to pay to enter them just to access the palace, it’s worth exploring and seeing what you come across. Filled with rivers and ponds, tree-lined avenues, classical statues and hidden temples, it’s a delightful place to get lost. Highlights include the Rose Pavilion (Розовый павильон GOOGLE MAP ; Pavlovsk Park; adult/student R300/150; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun) and the Private Garden (Собственный садик GOOGLE MAP ; Pavlovsk Park; adult/child R250/150; h11am-7pm), with its beautifully arranged flowerbeds and impressive sculpture of the Three Graces. Bike hire is available at several locations around the park and is a great way to explore, as distances are large.
THE MYSTERY OF THE AMBER ROOM

The original Amber Room was created from exquisitely engraved amber panels given to Peter the Great by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia in 1716. Rastrelli later combined the panels with gilded woodcarvings, mirrors, agate and jasper mosaics to decorate one of the rooms of the Catherine Palace. Plundered by the Nazis during WWII, the room’s decorative panels were last exhibited in Königsberg’s castle in 1941. Four years later, with the castle in ruins, the Amber Room was presumed destroyed. Or was it?
In 2004, as Putin and then German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder presided over the opening of the new US$18 million Amber Room, restored largely with German funds, rumours about the original panels continued to swirl. There are those who believe that parts, if not all, of the original Amber Room remain hidden away somewhere and have survived (see www.amberroom.org).
NEED TO KNOW

Pushkin is 25km south of St Petersburg, Pavlovsk 29km. The area code is %812.
From Moskovskaya Station, take the exit marked ‘Buses for theairport’, then pick up marshrutky 286, 299,342 or K545 towards Pushkin (R40). These continue to Pavlovsk (R50). Look for ‘Пушкин’ or ‘Дворец’ on buses. Trains go from Vitebsk Station, but are infrequent during the week.For Pushkin, get off at Detskoe Selo (Детское село), and for Pavlovsk at Pavlovsk Station (Павловск).

Vyborg
Explore
This appealing Gulf of Finland provincial town is dominated by a medieval castle and peppered with beautiful Finnish art nouveau buildings and romantic cobblestone streets.
The border has jumped back and forth around Vyborg for most of its history. Peter the Great captured it from the Swedes in 1710. A century later it fell within autonomous Finland, and after the revolution Vyborg remained part of independent Finland. Since then the Finns have called it Viipuri. Stalin took Vyborg in 1939, lost it to the Finns during WWII, and on getting it back at the end of the war deported all the Finns. Today the Finns are back by the coachloads for sightseeing and carousing on the weekends.

Getting There & Away
ATrain Elektrichki (R301, 2½ hours, hourly) leave from St Petersburg’s Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal). Of these, there are also a handful of express services (R331, 1¼ hours, four daily), or the far more expensive Helsinki-bound trains, which stop in Vyborg (R2236, one hour).
ABus Services to/from St Petersburg (R280, to/from either metro stations Devyatkino or Parnas) run every 20 minutes from 6.30am to 8pm. Theoretically, travel time is around 2¼ hours, but the traffic can lengthen this, so the train remains the best option.
AStation locations The bus and train stations are opposite each other on Vokzalnaya pl.

oVYBORG CASTLEHISTORIC BUILDING
(Выборгский замок GOOGLE MAP ; Zamkovy Island; grounds free, museum R100; hgrounds 9am-7pm daily, exhibitions 10am-6pm)
Rising stoutly from an islet in Vyborg Bay, this castle was built by the Swedes in 1293 when they first captured Karelia from Novgorod. Most of it now consists of 16th-century alterations. The castle contains several exhibition halls, including a mildly diverting small museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; R100; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun) on local history, but the main attraction is climbing the many steps of whitewashed St Olaf’s Tower ( GOOGLE MAP ) for commanding views over the town (closed for renovations at time of research).

A must-see for architecture fans is the beautifully designed public library, one of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto's iconic designs. After years of restoration, the 1935 building looks lovelier than ever, with painstaking efforts to return it to Aalto's original vision. Handmade bronze-handled doors, circular skylights in the reading room, and elegant birchwood shelves are among the many features. It's still a working public library, open to all (though oddly, it lacks wi-fi).

Repino
Explore
Come summer, Petersburgers stream out of the city to relax on the beaches to the north between Sestroretsk and Zelenogorsk on the Gulf of Finland. Between these two towns you’ll find the village of Repino, 45km from St Petersburg. From 1918 to the end of WWII, this area was part of Finland and the village was known as Kuokkala. In 1948, back in Russian hands, the village was renamed in honour of its most famous resident, Ilya Repin.

The home of Ilya Repin in his later years is now a museum and park, and it's a pleasant day trip any time of year. You can also visit the nearby beach and even stay in one of the area’s resort-style hotels in the summer.
Repin bought land here in 1899, named the estate after a Roman household god and designed the light-flooded house in an arts-and-crafts style. The artist produced many of his later works here, and several of his paintings still hang on the walls. The furnishings have been left just as they were during Repin’s residence, which was up to his death in 1930. His grave, marked by a simple Russian Orthodox wooden cross, is in the park, along with a couple of wooden follies also designed by Repin.
BEACH LASKOVYBEACH

Kronshtadt
Explore
With its grand cathedral, waterfront parks and pretty canal-lined avenues, Kronshtadt makes for a fascinating half-day visit. Aside from taking in one grand neo-Byzantine church and visiting a little-visited corner of greater St Petersburg, this is a fine place for seeing Russia’s mighty naval centre, and getting an overview of the bay on a boat tour.
Within a year of founding St Petersburg, Peter – desirous of protecting his new Baltic toehold – started work on the fortress of Kronshtadt on Kotlin Island, 29km out in the Gulf of Finland. It’s been a pivotal Soviet and Russian naval base ever since, and was closed to foreigners until 1996.

The cathedral underwent a thorough renovation for its centennial celebrations and is now looking breathtaking, both inside and out. Its 75m-high cupola is the highest point in town, and its enormous interior makes its use as a cinema during the Soviet period rather logical.

KRONSHTADT REBELLION

In 1921 the hungry and poor Red Army sailors stationed here organised an ill-fated mutiny against the Bolsheviks. They set up a Provisional Revolutionary Committee and drafted a resolution demanding, among other things, an end to Lenin’s harsh War Communism. On 16 March 1921 the mutineers were defeated when 50,000 troops crossed the ice from Petrograd and massacred nearly the entire naval force. The sailors’ stand wasn’t entirely in vain, as afterwards Lenin did scrap War Communism.





Transport

ARRIVING IN ST PETERSBURG
St Petersburg is well connected to the rest of Europe by plane, train, ferry and bus. The vast majority of travellers arrive in St Petersburg by air at Pulkovo Airport. Flight time from London and Paris to St Petersburg is three hours, from Berlin it’s a two-hour flight, and from Moscow it’s under an hour.
Train is also a popular way to get here – from Moscow there are pleasantly slow overnight sleeper trains as well as six to eight fast four-hour daytime Sapsan trains. See www.rzd.ru for details. From Helsinki there are four daily Allegro express trains that take you from the Finnish capital to St Petersburg in an impressive 3½ hours. See www.vr.fi for prices and timetables.
An increasing number of travellers arrive at one of St Petersburg’s five cruise and ferry terminals. There are regular connections between St Petersburg and Stockholm (22 to 24 hours), Tallinn (14 hours) and Helsinki (10 hours). Those who arrive this way also have the option of 72-hour visa-free travel. See St Peter Line for prices and timetables.
Flights, cars and tours can be booked online at lonelyplanet.com.
Pulkovo International Airport
Most travellers arrive in St Petersburg at Pulkovo International Airport (LED; GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 3822; www.pulkovoairport.ru; Pulkovskoye sh), 23km south of the city. This terminal building, which opened in 2014, and is confusingly still referred to as Terminal 1, handles all domestic and international flights and is St Petersburg's only airport.
Taxi
Taking a taxi from the airport to the city centre has never been easier or safer. Leave the terminal building and outside you'll find an official taxi dispatcher who will ask you for your destination's address, indicate which taxi to go to and write you a price on a slip of official paper that you can then give to your driver. Prices vary, but expect to pay between R800 and R1000 to reach the centre, depending on where exactly you’re headed. Drivers usually won’t speak much English, so just hand over the money on arrival – you don’t need to tip. It's also possible to book a trip into the city via a taxi app for around R700.
Marshrutka & Bus
For those on a budget, marshrutka (minibus) K39 shuttles you from outside the terminal building to the nearest metro station, Moskovskaya (R35, every five minutes, from 7am to 11.30pm). The bus terminates at the Moskovskaya metro station, so you don’t need to worry about where to get off, and you can connect to the rest of the city from there.
There's also bus 39 (R40, every 15 minutes, from 5.30am to 1.30am) that runs the same route over longer hours, but trundles along somewhat more slowly.
Moscow Station
If you’re arriving from Moscow, you’ll come to the Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal; Московский вокзал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.moskovsky-vokzal.ru; Nevsky pr 85; mPloshchad Vosstaniya) (Moskovsky vokzal), in the centre of the city. There are two metro stations close by: pl Vosstaniya (Line 1) and Mayakovskaya (Line 3). To get here (you can enter both stations through one building) turn left outside the main entrance to the Moscow Station, and the exit is in one side of the building on Ligovsky pr.
Finland Station
Trains from Helsinki arrive at the Finland Station (Финляндский вокзал; Finlyandsky vokzal MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.finlyandsky.dzvr.ru; pl Lenina 6; mPloshchad Lenina) (Finlyandsky vokzal). From here you can connect to anywhere in the city by metro from the Ploshchad Lenina station (Line 1) on the square outside the station.
Ladoga Station
Some trains from the Leningradskaya Oblast and those from Helsinki to Moscow stop en route in St Petersburg at the Ladoga Station (Ladozhsky vokzal; Ладожский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://lvspb.ru; Zanevsky pr 73; mLadozhskaya) (Ladozhsky vokzal). It’s served by the Ladozhskaya metro station (Line 4).
BUYING TICKETS IN ST PETERSBURG

You’ll most likely have your onward travel tickets when you arrive in St Petersburg, but if not it’s easy to purchase tickets for boat, bus, train and plane travel. First of all, try online – you can buy train tickets (www.rzd.ru), bus tickets (www.luxexpress.eu) and, of course, airline tickets via websites.
Buying train tickets in person can be done at any train station (even at a different terminus from where your train departs), although waiting time can be long if you buy them at a counter. Far quicker are the new ticket machines, which all work in English and where you can usually pay with either cash or credit card. Another option is the centrally located Train Tickets Centre (Кассы ЖД MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab kanala Griboyedova 24; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, until 6pm Sun; mGostiny Dvor), where there are also ticket machines, which makes waiting in line unnecessary.
You can buy ferry tickets for nearly all boats at the Ferry Centre (Паромный центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-327 3377; www.paromy.ru; ul Vosstaniya 19; h10am-7pm Mon-Fri; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), a short walk from the Moscow Station. Alternatively, it’s possible to buy ferry tickets in the Sea Port at the far-flung end of Vasilyevsky Island, as well as online through the ferry companies themselves.
If time is tight, then nearly all travel agencies can organise onward travel tickets for you, although of course there’s usually a markup on the cost and a delivery fee.
Bus Station
St Petersburg’s main bus station, Avtovokzal (Автобусный вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; %812-766 5777; www.avokzal.ru; nab Obvodnogo kanala 36; mObvodny Kanal), has bus connections to cities all over western Russia, including Veliky Novgorod, but most travellers won’t use it. If you do happen to arrive here, it’s a short walk along the canal to the metro station Obvodny Kanal (Line 5).
Sea Ports
There are a number of places where cruise ships arrive in St Petersburg, while all ferries from elsewhere in the Baltic arrive at the Sea Port on Vasilyevsky Island. Anyone on a river cruise from Moscow will arrive at the River Passenger Terminal in the south of the city, which is a short walk away from the Proletarskaya metro station (Line 3). Upon leaving the metro turn right onto pr Obukhovskoy Oborony and it’s five minutes up the road.
Marine Facade Terminal
The Marine Facade Terminal at the far end of Vasilyevsky Island is a relatively new facility. It’s not in the city centre, but all shore excursion operators have buses or cars for their passengers, and the journey to the Hermitage can be done in 30 minutes. The nearest metro station is Primorskaya, from where it’s just two stops to Gostiny Dvor (Line 3) in the Historic Heart, but it's a good 30-minute walk away and you'd be advised to arrange a taxi. Head down the main road from the Marine Facade, then once you’ve crossed Nalichnaya ul, take Novosmolenskaya nab and you’ll reach the station.
For taxis, an official dispatch stand is in the arrivals area, with fixed rates to various places around town. You’ll be given a slip of paper with the price you need to pay the driver: prices average from R200 to R400 depending on where in the centre you want to go.
Sea Port
If you’re arriving by ferry from Stockholm, Tallinn or Helsinki then you’ll disembark at the Sea Port in the southern corner of Vasilyevsky Island. It’s not served by the metro, so your easiest way into the city centre is to take a taxi. Drivers wait outside the terminal or you can order a taxi by phone app; prices average from R200 to R400 depending on where in the centre you want to go.
An alternative option is to take bus 7 (R40) from the main road outside. The bus should have pl Vosstaniya (Пл Восстания) written on it, and it goes all the way down Sredny pr, crosses the Neva at the Hermitage and then goes down Nevsky pr to pl Vosstaniya.
St Peter Line offers a €25 'tour package' bus service that shuttles passengers to St Isaac's Cathedral and back again every hour.
Other Ports
There are three other docks where cruise ships sometimes arrive in St Petersburg. Smaller cruise ships usually dock on either the English Embankment Passenger Terminal or the Lieutenant Schmidt Passenger Terminal. Neither terminal has much in the way of facilities, but both are centrally located and you’re within easy walking distance of the sights in the Historic Heart.
One far less attractive possibility is docking at the St Petersburg Sea Port, which is the main commercial and industrial port in the city. It’s on Gutuyevsky Island and a long way from anything. It’s technically possible to walk out of the port to the Narvskaya metro station, but reckon on a 30-minute walk through a fairly miserable industrial area. If you decide to walk, head up Obvodny Canal and then turn right onto Staropetrogovsky pr and you’ll see Narvskaya metro station on pl Stachek.
GETTING AROUND
Metro Fastest way to cover long distances. Has around 70 stations and runs from approximately 5.45am to 12.45am.
Bus, Trolleybus & Marshrutky Buses are best for shorter distances in areas without good metro coverage; they can be slow going, but the views are good. Trolleybuses are slower still, but are cheap and plentiful. Marshrutky are the private sector's contribution – fast fixed-route minibuses that you can get on or off anywhere along their routes.
Tram Largely obsolete and little used, but still useful in areas such as Kolomna and Vasilyevsky Island where there is little else available.
Metro
The St Petersburg Metro (%8-800- 350 1155; www.metro.spb.ru; h6am-12.45am) is a very efficient five-line system. The network of some 70 stations is most usefully employed for travelling long distances, especially connecting the suburbs to the city centre. New stations are being added and it's possible that the one at Teatralnaya, next to the Mariinsky Theatre, will be operational by 2020.
Look for signs with a big blue ‘M’ signifying the entrance to the metro. The flat fare for a trip is R45; you will have to buy an additional ticket if you are carrying a significant amount of baggage. If you wish to buy a single journey, ask for ‘adin proyezd’ and you will be given a zheton (token) to put in the machine.
If you are staying more than a day or two, however, it’s worth buying a smart card (R60), which is good for multiple journeys to be used over the course of a fixed time period – for example, 10 trips in seven days for R355. Their main advantage is that you won’t have to line up to buy tickets – the ticket counters can have very long lines during peak hours.
The metro system is fully signed in English, so it’s quite easy to use, even for first-timers in Russia.
Bus, Marshrutka & Trolleybus
Buses, and particularly marshrutky (minibuses), are a very handy way to get around the city and they tend to cover routes that the metro doesn’t, making them essential for certain parts of town. Most travellers find taking them a bit daunting, however, as there’s little signage in English. On both buses and trolleybuses, you get on and then pay a conductor; the fare is R40.
Marshrutky can be flagged down anywhere along their route (there are no bus stops for marshrutky). Open the door yourself and jump in, then once you’ve taken your seat you pay the driver (pass the money via your fellow passengers if you’re not sitting within reaching distance); the rates are usually posted on the inside of the bus near the driver. You’ll also need to request the stop you want – usually announcing to the driver the name of the street or the place you’re going to shortly before you get there. Alternatively, when you want to get off, simply say (or shout!): ‘AstanavEEtye pazhalsta!’ ('Stop please!') and the driver will pull over as soon as possible.
Taxi
Taxi apps, such as Gett and Yandex Taxi, are all the rage in St Petersburg and they've brought down the prices of taxis in general, while improving the service a great deal.
Aside from the apps, the best way to get a taxi is to order it by phone. Operators will usually not speak English, so unless you speak Russian, ask your hotel reception to call a taxi for you. It also remains possible to flag down a random car in the street and negotiate the price, keeping in mind all security caveats.

AIf you're keen to do a lot of cycling, bring a helmet, bike lights and a good lock from home, as these are hard to come by.
AVelogorod (%812-648 2100; http://spb.velogorod.org; ride/day pass R45/129) is a handy bike-sharing system with 56 stations across the city. You'll need to use the website or download the app to hire one of their bicycles.
BRIDGE TIMETABLE

From mid-April until late November major bridges across the Neva rise at the following times overnight to allow ships to pass through the city. It's rare that the Grenadersky, Kantemirovsky and Sampsonievsky Bridges over the Bolshaya Nevka River (connecting the Vyborg and Petrograd Sides) are raised and, if so, two days' notice is given beforehand. You can check the full, up-to-date timetable at www.razvodka-mostov.ru (in Russian only).
Because of the new fixed suspension bridges on the Western High Speed Diameter highway across the mouth of the Neva you will not be stuck either side of the river when the bridges go up. Note also that between May and the end of November the M5 metro line shuttles every 20 minutes back and forth between Admiralteyskaya and Sportivnaya stations between 1am and 3am on Saturday and Sunday and the eve of public holidays, creating an easy way to get between the islands and the Historic Heart.
