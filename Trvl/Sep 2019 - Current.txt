BARRI GÒTIC
TAPAS BARS
!!! +
Bodega La Plata C/Mercè 28 933 151 009, barlaplata.com; Drassanes; map. A classic taste of the old town, with a marble counter open to the street and dirt-cheap wine served straight from the barrel. For €2.50 you can get a dish of the speciality anchovies, either marinated or deep-fried like whitebait. Mon–Sat 9am–3pm & 6.30–11pm.
	Tucked away on a narrow lane near the waterfront, La Plata is a humble but well-loved bodega that serves just three plates: pescadito frito (small fried fish), butifarra (sausage) and tomato salad. Add in the drinkable, affordable wines (per glass €1.20) and you have the makings of a fine predinner tapas spot.

Café de l’Acadèmia C/Lledó 1 933 198 253; Jaume I; map. Great for a date or a lazy lunch, with creative Catalan cooking served in a romantic stone-flagged restaurant or outside in the medieval square. Prices are pretty reasonable (mains €12–20) and it’s always busy, so dinner reservations essential. Mon–Fri 1.30–4pm & 8.30–11.30pm; closed 2 weeks in Aug.
	Expect succulent meat grills, fresh fish, rice dishes and a taste of local favourites like bacallà (salt cod), wild mushrooms or grilled vegetables. 
	A no-choice menú del dia is a bargain for the quality (and it’s even cheaper eaten at the bar). Mon–Fri 1.30–4pm & 8.30–11.30pm; closed 2 weeks in Aug.
	a mix of traditional Catalan dishes with the occasional creative twist
	at lunchtime, local Ajuntament (town hall) office workers pounce on the menú del día (daily set menu; €14.30). In the evening it is rather more romantic, as low lighting emphasises the intimacy of the beamed ceiling and stone walls.

El Xampanyet C/Montcada 22 933 197 003; Jaume I; map. Traditional blue-tiled bar doing a roaring trade in sparkling cava, cider and tapas (anchovies are the speciality, but there’s also marinaded tuna, spicy mussels, sun-dried tomatoes, sliced meats and cheese). A drink and a couple of tapas will cost around €10. Tues–Sat noon–3.30pm & 7–11pm, Sun noon–3.30pm; closed Aug.

	As is often the way, the drinks are cheap and the tapas turn out to be rather pricey (€5–9 each, and portions aren’t generous), but there’s usually a good buzz about the place

Can Maño C/Baluard 12 933 193 082; Barceloneta; map. This old-fashioned diner is packed with noisy locals around formica tables. Expect fried or grilled fish, basic wine and absolutely no frills, but it’s an authentic experience, which should cost around €15 a head. Mon 8–11pm, Tues–Fri 8–11am, 12.15–4pm & 8–11pm, Sat 8–11am & 12.15–4pm; closed Aug.
	Basically, your choice is fried or grilled fish, such as sardines, mullet or calamari, supplemented by a few daily seafood specials and basic meat dishes. Expect rough house wine and absolutely no frills, but it’s an authentic experience, which is likely to cost you less than €15 a head
	It may look like a dive, but you’ll need to be prepared to wait before being squeezed in at a packed table for a raucous night of raciones (full-plate-size tapas serving) over a bottle of cloudy white turbio (Galician wine) at this family-run stalwart. The seafood is abundant, with first-rate squid, prawns and fish served at rock-bottom prices.

Espai Kru C/Lleida 7 934 248 152; espaikru.com; Poble Sec; map. Annexed to Cañota and upstairs from traditional – and extremely expensive – seafood restaurant Rías de Galicia, this creative restaurant gives deep-sea delicacies a more contemporary context.

Quimet i Quimet C/Poeta Cabanyes 25 934 423 142; Paral.lel; map. In Poble Sec’s cosiest tapas bar, little plates of classy finger-food (mostly €3–10) are served reverently from the minuscule counter – things like roast onions, marinaded mushrooms, stuffed cherry tomatoes and anchovy-wrapped olives. Mon–Fri noon–4pm & 7–10.30pm, Sat noon–4pm; closed Aug.
	family-run business that has been passed down from generation to generation. There’s barely space to swing a calamar in this bottle-lined, standing-room-only place, but it is a treat for the palate, with montaditos (tapas on a slice of bread) made to order.

Tickets Avgda. Paral.lel 164; online reservations only on elbarriadria.com; Poble Sec; map. Swanky tapas bar under the star-studded helm of pastry-chef supremo Albert Adrià and his El Bulli-famed brother Ferran Adrià. It’s terrifically classy (dishes €5–20 each; expect to spend €70), but with only eighty covers a night, and online reservations up to two months in advance, you can’t guarantee a table. Tues–Fri 7–11pm, Sat 1–3.30pm & 7–11.30pm; closed 2 weeks in Aug.
	Michelin-starred tapas bar opened by Ferran Adrià, of the legendary (since closed) El Bulli, and his brother Albert. Bookings are only taken online two months in advance, but you can try calling for last-minute cancellations. The food veers towards the deliciously surreal in concoctions like crispy octopus with kimichi mayo or sage-marinated prawns with frozen salt, followed by sweet-potato sorbet with liquorice and tangerine sponge. The seafood bar serves a variety of oysters, with caviar, borscht and other unusual toppings.

Casa Calvet C/Casp 48 934 124 012, casacalvet.es; Catalunya/Urquinaona; map. The wonderfully decorated townhouse that a young Antoni Gaudí built for a Catalan industrialist makes for a truly glam night out. It offers a seasonally changing modern Catalan menu, with mains around the €30 mark, weekday lunch at €38 or tasting menus from €55 to €68. Mon–Sat 1–3.30pm & 8.30–11pm; closed Mon June–Aug.

The hottest restaurant in Barcelona currently belongs to three former head chefs of the now-closed El Bulli, for many years considered the best in the world. The creativity here is off the charts. Tasting menus (starting at €110) are an endless procession of tiny delights that will make you smile and groan with pleasure, at least until the bill arrives. Food served Tues–Sat 1–2.30pm & 8–9.30pm.

Meals are served tapas-style, day and night (dishes €4–12), based on seasonal market produce, from wild mushrooms to locally landed fish. Mon–Sat 8am–1am; closed 3 weeks in Aug.
	It’s a handsome bar-restaurant of dark wood and deep colours, and while the name is a nod to the house speciality gourmet sandwiches (a flauta is a thin baguette), there are also meals served tapas-style, day and night (dishes €4–12), based on local market produce, from wild mushrooms to locally landed fish

Everything served here is organic, wild-caught or sustainably sourced but that doesn’t mean that ethics come before enjoyment. Sergi’s cooking is fun and flavoursome, influenced by his mother (who serves hearty breakfasts here) and by his time in top fine-dining restaurants.

The tapas, like roasted-chicken croquettes with romesco sauce (€4), or aubergine fritters with goat’s cheese, honey and apples (€8), are fantastic, and the atmosphere is chatty and convivial. Hundreds of “love notes” scrawled by customers on the white-tiled walls attest to its popularity. Mon 7pm–midnight, Tues–Sat 1–4.30pm & 7.30pm–midnight.

Can Paixano C/Reina Cristina 7 933 100 839, canpaixano.com; Barceloneta; map. This crowded backstreet joint where the drink of choice – all right, the only drink – is cava (the Catalan answer to champagne) is a must on everyone’s itinerary. Don’t go thinking sophistication – the drinks might come in traditional champagne saucers (the sort of thing Dean Martin used to stack in a pyramid and then pour wine over), but this is a counter-only joint where there’s fizz, tapas and tapas-in-sandwiches and that’s your lot. And who could want more? Mon–Sat 9am–10.30pm; closed Easter week.
	This lofty old champagne bar (also called La Xampanyeria) has long been run on a winning formula. The standard poison is bubbly rosé in elegant little glasses, combined with bite-sized bocadillos (filled rolls) and tapas (€3 to €7). Note that this place is usually packed to the rafters, and elbowing your way to the bar can be a titanic struggle.

In 218 BC, their settlement was taken by Scipio, and a Roman city – more splendid than the Greek, with an amphitheatre, fine villas and a broad marketplace – grew up above the old Greek town. The Romans were replaced in turn by the Visigoths, who built several basilicas, and Emporion disappears from the records only in the ninth century when, it is assumed, it was wrecked by either Saracen or Norman pirates

			tours include Dalí’s studio, the exotically draped model’s room, the couple’s master bedroom and bathroom, a secondary workshop in an olive grove and, perhaps best of all, the oval-shaped sitting room that Dalí designed for Gala, which, apparently by accident, boasts stunning acoustics. You’ll also see the garden and swimming pool where the couple entertained guests – they didn’t like too many strangers trooping through their living quarters. The phallic-shaped pool and its various decorative features, including a giant snake and a stuffed lion, are a treat
			
			Salvador Dalí had many obsessions, but none quite like Gala, his beloved wife and lifelong muse, who he met when she was visiting Cadaqués in 1929 with her husband, French poet Paul Eluard. Dalí and Gala fell in love and married in 1934. Dalí lavished many gifts on her, including, in 1969, the medieval castle of Casa Púbol. Gala lived here, and rumour has it that she entertained a string of lovers all the while, and imposed strict rules on Dalí, who supposedly had to get permission before he could visit. She stayed here until her death in 1982, when Dalí moved in. The artist made this his permanent base until 1984 when fire struck parts of the castle, prompting him to move to Figueres
			
			the life of Gala Dalí is fascinating in its own right, due to her entanglement with several pivotal figures in the first half of the 20th century. Gala married French poet Paul Éluard in 1917, had a two-year affair with pioneer of Dadaism Max Ernst, and then met Dalí in 1929. With Dalí’s approval she continued to take lovers, though their loyalty to each other remained fierce. Dalí was only permitted to visit the castle with advance written permission, a restriction that held considerable erotic charge for the artist

Girona and around
Medieval, beautifully preserved Girona, which is accessible within an hour from the sea, offers a refreshing change from the sun-and-sand hedonism of the Costa Brava. This elegant, provincial capital features a walled medieval quarter, Barri Vell, perched on a hill above the city – a delight to explore, with narrow cobbled alleyways, balconied houses and shady little plaças. Clinging to the banks of the Ríu Onyar, as it meanders through the centre of town, is a long row of picturesque pastel-hued houses, the Cases de l’Onyar.
Historically, Girona has seen it all – at least by Spanish standards. The Romans settled here, and called the town Gerunda. Girona then became an Islamic town after the Moors conquered Spain. A vibrant Jewish community also flourished here for more than six centuries, and Girona’s Call, the medieval Jewish quarter, remains one of the best preserved in Spain. Elsewhere, you’ll spy a fetching mix of architectural styles, from Romanesque to modernisme. Girona also features a range of excellent museums, a lovely Catedral and lively arts and music festivals. Rambla de la Llibertat, running along the river, is the city’s grand promenade, where locals take their daily paseo past a bustling strip of shops and restaurants.
!!!
The Catedral
Pl. de la Catedral • Daily: July–Aug 10am–7.30, Sept–Oct & April–June 10am–6.30pm; Nov–March 10am–5.30pm; hours may vary • €7, includes Basilica of Sant Feliu • 972 215 814, catedraldegirona.org
Looming majestically over the old quarter, Girona’s Catedral is an elegant amalgamation of architectural styles. The Romanesque cloister and tower are the only parts remaining from the original eleventh-century building, and the Catedral was continually rebuilt and expanded up to and throughout the eighteenth century. The splendid Gothic nave, dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, is the second widest of its kind in the world (after St Peter’s in Rome). Also impressive are the fourteenth-century silver altarpiece and Gothic tombs.
It’s well worth visiting the twelfth-century cloister (same hours as the Catedral), and the Tresor Capitular (Chapter Treasury), which features a wealth of religious artefacts, including medieval gold pieces, a fifteenth-century bible and the ornate sixteenth-century retablo of Santa Elena. The main attraction is a splendid Italian tapestry, which dates back to the twelfth century and depicts the Creation.
!!!
Museu d’Art
Pujada de la Catedral 12 • March–Sept Tues–Sat 10am–7pm, Sun 10am–2pm; Oct–Feb Tues–Sat 10am–6pm, Sun 10am–2pm • €4.50 • 972 203 834, museuart.com
Housed in the Palau Episcopal (Bishop’s Palace) near the Catedral, Girona’s five storey Museu d’Art features a wide-ranging collection of Romanesque, Gothic and modern art, including beautifully preserved murals from local churches, fifteenth-century embroidery and rare stained-glass tables. Don’t miss the tenth-century portable altar from Sant Pere de Rodes and the impressive collection of modern Catalan art, such as sculptures by Olot artist Miquel Blay.

Pl. de Sant Feliu • Mon–Sat 10am–5.30pm, Sun 1am–5.30pm • €7, includes Catedral
The large Església de Sant Feliu is one of Girona’s most iconic churches, and it reveals an interesting transition between the Romanesque and Gothic styles. The thirteenth-century Romanesque interior is topped by a grand Gothic nave, and a Baroque tower looms over the western facade. The highlight is the Catalan Gothic statue, Crist Jacent (Recumbent Christ).
???
Banys Àrabs
C/Ferran el Catòlic • April–Sept Mon–Sat 10am–7pm, Sun 10am–2pm; Oct–March Mon–Sat 10am–2pm • €2 • 972 190 797, banysarabs.org
Built in the twelfth century, the Banys Àrabs (Arab baths) were inspired by the Romans’ public bathhouses, and are among the best preserved of their type in Spain. The Moorish-tinged Romanesque building contains several graceful rooms, each with its own pool: the frigidarium (cold-water room), whose elegant columns support a central dome; the tepidarium (warm-water room); and the caldarium, the steam room, which was heated by a roaring fire burning underneath. Also on view is the apodyterium (changing room), and there’s an outdoor terrace, a good vantage point to view both the building’s exterior and the surrounding Girona cityscape.

!!!
Passeig de la Muralla
Daily 10am–8pm • Free
One of the finest vantage points over Girona is from the Passeig de la Muralla, also known as the Passeig Arqueològic, a walkway along the ramparts and medieval city wall. You can gain access to it from various points, including from near the Museu Arqueologia. As you trudge along the perimeter of the walls, you can enjoy lovely views of Girona – over the colourful rooftops to the river snaking through the centre – and the surrounding Ter valley. The walkway has several exits along the way, and it ends at Pl. Catalunya, where you can descend and amble back into the old town.
???
Carrer de la Força and the Jewish Quarter
Girona’s Jewish community, known as the Call or the Aljama, existed for more than six hundred years, and the warren of narrow streets and alleyways around Carrer de la Força is widely regarded as one of the finest preserved Jewish neighbourhoods in Europe.
???
Centre Bonastruc ça Porta and Museu d’Història dels Jueus
C/la Força 8 • Mon–Sat 10am–6pm, Sun 10am–2pm • €4 • 972 216 761, girona.cat/call
The well-run Centre Bonastruc ça Porta, housed in a former synagogue, is home to the Museu d’Història dels Jueus, which does an excellent job of curating archeological and ethnological finds from Girona’s Jewish heritage. The exhibition covers themes such as festivals and tradition; the synagogue and cemetery; the diaspora; and the Inquisition, which features a display of original documents ordering the expulsion of all Jews from Spain. Other highlights include a gilded seal used for making Passover bread; a fourteenth-century limestone slab inscribed with Jewish law from a local synagogue; and a unique belt buckle, dating to between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, engraved with what is believed to be the mythical Leviathan, which features in the Hebrew Bible.

JEWISH GIRONA
A Jewish community first settled in Girona in the late ninth century; by the tenth century, the Jews had become a prosperous and influential sector of the city’s society, but this all changed in the thirteenth century, when Gironan Jews became the victims of severe and unrelenting persecution. The entire Jewish quarter became a constant target of racist attacks and eventually became an isolated ghetto, in which the residents were virtually imprisoned, confined within neighbourhood limits and banned from the rest of the city. This continued until 1492, when all Jews were expelled from Spain. Life in the Call was bleak and presented an immense daily challenge: out of desperate necessity, residents created an underground community of tiny alleys and courtyards within which to survive.

???
Museu d’Història de la Ciutat
C/la Força 27 • Tues–Sat 10am–2pm & 5–7pm, Sun 10am–2pm • €4 • 972 222 229, girona.cat
Girona’s history is formidable, and the excellent Museu d’Història de la Ciutat offers a well-organized overview under one roof. There’s a wide range of Roman remains and modern arts and crafts on show, and the museum includes exhibits on the old fortified walls, and those who attacked them to plunder Girona; the history of the Catalan sardana dance and other folkloric traditions; and contemporary paintings by regional artists.
!!!
Casa Masó
Ballesteries 29 • Tues–Sat 10am–6pm; accessible via guided visits only; book online or by phone • €5 • 972 413 989, rafaelmaso.org
Step into early twentieth-century Girona at the superbly restored home of acclaimed Girona architect Rafael Masó (1880–1935), who formed a key part of the Catalan noucentisme cultural movement. Noucentisme, which took its name from the “1900s” (in Catalan, noucents), was both a continuation of modernisme and a reaction to it, with a style that was characterized by elegant classicism as well as a renewed civic and Catalan pride. Casa Masó is the only one of the famous houses on the Ríu Onyar that is open to the public, and the beautifully designed interior features period furnishings, as well as paintings, sculpture, ceramics and drawings from the eighteenth to twentieth centuries.

The top-notch Museu del Cinema, based on an extraordinary private collection, is less a museum and more of what the curators call “cinema before cinema”, with an utterly intriguing array of the gadgets and artefacts that provided popular entertainment before cinema itself came along, from Indonesian shadow puppets to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century devices like phantasmagoria, fantascopes and magic lanterns. It’s all rounded up with movie memorabilia, including costumes from Tootsie and Hello Dolly.

FEAST ACROSS CATALUNYA AT MERCAT DEL LLEÓ
Barcelona has the famous La Boquería; Girona’s version is the Mercat del Lleó (Mon–Thurs & Sat 7am–3pm, Fri 5pm–8pm; 972 483 749, mercatlleo.cat), a colourful, aromatic market that unfolds just east of the river on Pl. Calvet i Rubalcaba. The 60-plus stalls reflect the natural diversity of Catalunya – apples and pears from fragrant Girona orchards, mushrooms pulled from Pyrenean soil, pungent goat's cheeses from the Garrotxa region and vast displays of freshly caught seafood from the Mediterranean. Take a twirl through the market for a whiff of local flavour, and then refuel over a café at the market bar. For a deeper exploration of the market and Girona’s culinary heritage, check out Girona Food Tours (gironafoodtours.com; tours and fees vary), launched by two long-time Girona residents.

DINING WITH THE ROCA BROTHERS
Every year, restaurants around the world vie for first place in Restaurant magazine’s annual Top 50 list. And in 2013 and 2015, that honour went to El Celler de Can Roca. The Roca brothers – Joan, Josep and Jordi – had already been household names in Spain, but nabbing the top spots – twice – catapulted them onto the worldwide culinary stage. Their win was well-deserved, and each brother continues to work his speciality within the restaurant – Joan as the head chef, Jordi on desserts, and Josep on wine. If you don’t get a reservation at the restaurant, you can still sample the Roca magic – at their Rocambolesc Gelateria in Girona. The shop also functions as an introduction to the famous restaurant, with cookbooks and other information.

Figueres
It is a testament to Dalí’s enduring popularity that his eponymous museum, in the middle of FIGUERES, 35km northeast of Girona, is the most visited sight in Spain after Madrid’s Prado and Bilbao’s Guggenheim. There’s more to Figueres, of course, but you wouldn’t immediately know it from the crowds tripping over themselves to get to the museum. Native son Dalí returned to Figueres specifically to create this homage to Surrealism, and what an homage it is: wonderfully bizarre and cheekily interactive, the museum is all you’d expect from the world’s most celebrated Surrealist.
By all means make the museum your first stop – but leave yourself some time to roam Figueres afterwards. Cutting a wide swathe through the centre of town is La Rambla de Figueres, a graceful, leafy pedestrian street lined with modern houses and outdoor cafés. The Museu de l’Empordà features local archeological finds and the nearby Castell de Sant Ferran is a massive fortification on sprawling grounds.

Gala i Salvador Dalí • Dalí Joies Corner of C/María Àngels Vayreda and Pujada del Castell • Both: March–May Tues–Sun 9.30am–6pm, June–Sept daily 9am–8pm, Oct Tues–Sun 9.30am–6pm, Nov–Feb Tues–Sun 10.30am–6pm; last admission 45min before closing • €14 for Teatre includes entry to Dalí Joies • 972 677 500, salvador-dali.org
One thing is certain: you won’t have trouble spotting the Teatre-Museu Dalí. Just look for a roof topped with giant eggs and a red facade with protruding bread loaves. Housed in a former theatre – which is particularly apt, for this most theatrical of artists – the museum is designed around a large courtyard with white ceramic sinks and gold mannequins inspired by Oscar statues. Light streams into the building through a transparent, geodesic dome ceiling that resembles the eye of a fly, in a nod to Dalí’s fixation with insects. Incidentally, the artist had no problem with flies, but was supposedly repulsed by ants, which he depicted crawling out of eyeballs and such in his paintings.
Dalí created the museum to be an all-round sensory – and surreal – experience. Look through binoculars to see Gala Nude Looking at the Sea Which at Twenty Metres is Transformed into a Portrait of Abraham Lincoln, or revive a “dead” body in a coffin made of circuit boards. And check out The Face of Mae West That Can Be Used as a Drawing Room, in which Mae’s giant nose has a fireplace (complete with logs) built into each nostril, and her fleshy red lips are a couch.
Inside the Sala de Tresor are housed many of Dalí’s better-known works, including The Spectre of Sex Appeal, which explores the artist’s famous sex phobia. Other emblematic works include Soft Self-Portrait with Fried Bacon, in which Dalí’s dripping visage is held up by little sticks, and Venus de Milo with Drawers.
The museum also features a terrific line-up of changing temporary exhibits, which have included everything from Dali self-portraits to the artist’s three-dimentional art.
Dalí, fittingly, is buried in his fantastical museum. By 1984, he had moved to the nearby Torre Galtea, where he died in 1989. His body now lies behind a simple granite slab in a basement gallery of the museum. The museum ticket includes entry to the nearby Dalí Joies exhibit, featuring jewels designed by Dalí.

DALÍ BY NIGHT
The Dalí Museum may be surreal by day, but is even more so at night (and especially after a glass of cava). In the summer, generally from late July to late August, the museum opens its doors at night (10pm–1am; last entry at 12.30am). For an admission price of €15, visitors are offered a glass of cava on one of the terraces, where they also show a film on Dalí. There is limited capacity, so it’s worth booking ahead, which you can do on the museum website (salvador-dali.org).

From ancient toy wooden tops and bronze Roman rattles to candy-red cars, miniature circuses and twentieth-century optical-illusion games, the Museu del Joguet de Catalunya (Toy Museum of Catalunya) offers a playful glimpse into the history of having fun. Particularly curious are the religious items, which include altar boys’ clothes from 1905 and mini-churches with tiny moveable priest figures. Don’t miss the traditional caganers, little figurines of squatting peasants taking a break to “fertilize the earth”, who are cheekily hidden in the back of Catalan nativity scenes. The museum also hosts lively temporary exhibits, such as the recent “Salvador Dalí: the first twenty years”.

The impressive eighteenth-century fortified Castell de Sant Ferran, one of the largest in Europe, stands 1km northwest of Figueres. Explore the sprawling castle grounds and walk its 4km perimeter and you’ll get a sense of just how massive it is. It was at Sant Ferran that the last official meeting of Spain’s Republican parliament took place, on February 1, 1939, before it surrendered to Franco’s forces. More recently, Colonel Tejero was imprisoned here after his failed coup attempt in 1981.

Considered the birthplace of modern Catalan cuisine, El Motel (as the restaurant is now called in homage to its roots) continues to serve some of the finest and most innovative food in the region. The chefs find inspiration in the sea, with dishes like wild sea bass from Cadaqués with lime leaves and polenta, and rock lobster from Cap de Creus with fragrant rice, shrimp from Roses and sea cucumbers. Dishes start at €22. Book ahead. Daily 1–3.30pm & 8.30–10.30pm.

La Garrotxa
The fertile landscape of La Garrotxa, which unfolds west of Girona and Figueres, is anchored by the historic capital of Olot. To the east lies lovely, quiet Besalú; to the north, mountain peaks march along the French border; and to the south extends the Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica, a verdant, hilly terrain punctuated by volcanic cones and craters.
Besalú
Medieval BESALÚ, about 50km north of Girona, is a captivating sight: the impressive eleventh-century Romanesque Pont Fortificat spans the River Fluvià at the entrance to the town, beyond which rise church towers amid stone houses. These days, Besalú is a small, humble town, but its beautifully preserved core, with dark little streets, arcaded shops and elegant historic architecture, is testament to its formidable past. Roman, Visigothic and Muslim rulers all passed through, but Besalú’s most important role came between the tenth and twelfth centuries, when it served as the capital of the region until power was transferred to Barcelona.
---
Església de Sant Pere and around
The thirteenth-century Casa de la Vila, which now houses the ajuntament, rises over Pza. de la Llibertat. To the west of Llibertat lies a spacious plaça, the Prat de Sant Pere, which is presided over by the tenth-century Benedictine monastery Església de San Pere. Keep an eye out for the beautiful Gothic window on the west facade. The nearby Romanesque Església de Sant Vicenç features impressive Gothic capitals. Both churches are usually only open for services, but guided tours are sometimes organized by the turisme.
???
Miqvé
Baixada de Mikwe • Guided tours: summer usually daily noon, 1.30pm, 4.30pm & 6pm; check with turisme for times the rest of the year
Similar to Girona, Besalú had a Jewish community from the ninth century onwards, until the Jews were forced out of town in 1436 due to Christian persecution. Their Miqvé, said to be the only existing Jewish ritual bath in Spain, sits near the river and features a barrel-vaulted underground stone room. The bath was also once connected to the town’s synagogue, the remains of which were discovered nearby.
arrival and Information: Besalú
By bus The bus stop is on the main Olot–Girona road; there are regular buses to and from Figueres (30min) and Girona (50min).

Beget
The tiny village of BEGET, about 30km northwest of Besalú, is nestled so deeply in a valley that you don’t see it until you’re almost upon it. And when you do, it’s a handsome sight: Beget looks much as it did centuries ago, with narrow cobbled streets, little bridges and stone houses. A stillness fills the graceful twelfth-century church, Sant Cristòfor, which rises over the village. The church (sporadic opening times; enquire in the village) is notable for its Majestat, a carved-wood figure of Christ in a full-length tunic, arms outstretched.
ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE: BEGET
By bus and taxi It’s hard to reach Beget without your own transport. If you don’t have your own wheels, the best option is to take a bus to Camprodon, and then hire a taxi.

Olot
La Garrotxa’s provincial capital, OLOT, is an amiable, mid-sized town with busy shopping streets and a breezy Pl. Mayor. Passeig d’en Blay, the central rambla, is flanked by lovely historic buildings and dotted with lively cafés. Olot’s varied countryside, marked by sheer cliffs, verdant valleys and extinct volcanic cones and craters, inspired the highly respected nineteenth- and twentieth-century Olot School of landscape painters, whose works you can view in the town’s Museu de la Garrotxa.
???
Museu de la Garrotxa
C/Hospici 8 • Summer Tues–Fri 10am–1pm & 3–6pm, Sat 11am–2pm & 4–7pm, Sun 11am–2pm; rest of year, hours may vary • €3 • 972 271 166, olotcultura.cat
Nature was at the core of the Olot School of painters, who explored Garrotxa’s unique landscape on canvas, from rolling, pastoral hills to desolate terrain punctuated by stark trees. The school, founded by Joaquim Vayreda i Vila, was also influenced by the French Impressionists. You can view many of its striking works in the well-curated Museu de la Garrotxa, housed in a renovated eighteenth-century hospital. The museum also features modernista sculptures by Miquel Blay and Josep Clarà, and exhibits on the history of Olot and Catalan arts and crafts.

Also here is the Museu dels Volcans, which features exhibits on the volcanic history of the region, including rock samples and photos.

CYCLING THE CARRILET
Where trains once rumbled down tracks, cyclists can now pedal amid quiet greenery. The Ruta del Carrilet (viesverdes.cat) are traffic-free trails for pedestrians and cyclists that follow unused train lines, offering the chance to ride or stroll through the rolling Catalan countryside, passing small towns and villages along the way. Among the most popular is the 54km Olot-to-Girona route. In Olot, the trail starts at Fonts Sant Roc (Sant Roc Springs), just southwest of the city, near the Fluvià River; enquire at the turisme for further information and directions. The route is relatively flat and therefore appropriate for all levels, and is especially popular with families.

Arrival and information: olot

Accommodation and eating
Olot has a range of decent hotels and hostels in town, but some of the most appealing accommodation options are the manors and B&Bs in the surrounding countryside, many of which make the most of their proximity to the Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica, with terraces, hearty breakfasts to fuel your hiking, and bikes for hire.

VOLCANIC CUISINE
The volcanic fields of the Garrotxa region aren’t just an intrinsic part of the landscape – they’re also an intrinsic part of the local cuisine. Garrotxa is famed for its fertile soil, which has given way to an equally fertile and rich Cuina Volcànica (cuinavolcanica.cat). Traditional ingredients – all locally produced – include Santa Pau haricot beans, black radishes, mushrooms and sheep’s cheese. Olot, Besalú and Santa Pau have a variety of top-notch Cuina Volcànica restaurants, such as La Deu. If you’re in the area in January, head to Santa Pau for its Fira de Fesol, which celebrates the region’s famous beans.

Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica
The sprawling Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica makes up much of the Baixa Garrotxa region. You won’t see lava flows and smoke-snorting volcanoes, though – the last eruption was almost 11,000 years ago, and the park is in fact largely green and verdant, with a remarkably fertile soil. The volcanic landscape comes in the shape of the park’s forty cones, which vary widely in size, the bigger ones topping 170m.
There are numerous trails through the park – if you’re short on time, you can opt to take shorter trails to several of the volcanoes that start at car parks around Olot. Posted signs point out those that lead to the two easiest cones to access from town: Volcà del Croscat, the youngest cone in the park, and Volcà de Santa Margarida.
arrival and information: Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica
Accessing the park You’ll need your own wheels to access the park; there is a regular Teisa bus service between Girona and Olot.

Santa Pau
Medieval Santa Pau, 9km southwest of Olot, sits right in the middle of the volcanic region, and is a great jumping-off point for exploration. The beautifully preserved village features stone houses, narrow lanes, ancient archways and the thirteenth-century Pl. Mayor, once the Firal dels Bous (Cattle Market). Santa Pau is also known for its fesols (haricot beans), which figure prominently in the local cuisine. The village celebrates its beloved bean in the Fira de Sant Antonic, also known as the Fira de Fesol (Fesol Festival), in mid- or late January.

Vic
The Serra del Montseny, a towering granite mountain range with lushly forested slopes, looms southwest of Girona. On the west of the range, 34km southwest of Olot and easily accessible as a day-trip from Barcelona, is the amiable, well-preserved town of Vic. Vic is considered one of the more quintessential Catalan centres, both because the locals have especially strong Catalan pride, and also because it’s near the Ripoll area, cradle of Catalan history. Vic was once the capital of an Iberian tribe, and in the second century became a Roman settlement – you’ll spy various Roman remains, including parts of a temple, scattered around town.
Vic also hosted a prosperous medieval market, and the town has a yearly Mercat Medieval de Vic (firesifestes.com) in its old quarter in early December, celebrating its medieval past. Vic is defined by its elegant, enormous Pl. Mayor, ringed by historic, porticoed buildings, which features a colourful food market twice a week (Tues & Sat) – and if there’s one thing to buy, it’s Vic’s famous sausages (llonganissa or fuet), which are heralded throughout Catalunya and perfect for tossing into the suitcase to bring home.

The Catalan Pyrenees
Looming gracefully over northern Catalunya, the snow-tipped Pyrenees form a mighty barrier between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe. You can ski and hike throughout these mountains, making use of a range of ski centres and vast stretches of natural parkland. Imposing peaks reach more than 3400m, while fierce rivers cleave the green valleys; tucked away in the valleys and clinging to the mountains are centuries-old alpine villages, each with its own Romanesque church, collectively forming an open-air rural museum of early medieval architecture, particularly in the beautiful Vall de Boí.
The Pyrenees are easy to reach from Barcelona – Ripoll, a gateway town to the mountains, is accessible in less than three hours. The ski scene dominates the mountains northwest of Ripoll, while summer draws hikers and trekkers. North of Ripoll is the village of Ribes de Freser, where you can board the famous cremallera railway which snakes its way up to the small ski town and pilgrimage site of Núria – one of the most magnificent journeys in the Pyrenees.
West of here stretches the formidable Serra del Cadí, which offers superb hiking and trekking around one of Catalunya’s most recognizable peaks, the Pedraforca. To the north, along the French border, is La Cerdanya, a lush, sunny Pyrenean valley that’s especially popular in the summer with outdoor enthusiasts. Cerdanya’s capital is the lively town of Puigcerdà, while just across the border sits the geographical oddity of Llívia, a Spanish town fully enclosed by France. In winter, skiers flock to La Molina and Masella, the two big ski resorts in the area.
The mountainous terrain around La Seu d’Urgell, still further west, offers some of the best trekking in the Pyrenees. Whitewater aficionados get their adrenalin rush in the Noguera Pallaresa valley, where churning rivers offer the best rafting in the region. Finally, in the far northwest unfolds the rugged Parc Nacional d’Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici, and lush Val d’Aran, one of Spain’s top ski resorts.
LONG-DISTANCE HIKING IN THE PYRENEES
Running roughly parallel to the GR10, which runs on the French side, the GR11 is a network of long-distance hiking trails which traverses the Spanish Pyrenees from one end to the other. Estimated to be about 850–900km in length, it runs from the Golfo de Vizcaya (Bay of Biscay) in the Basque region to the west to Cap de Creus, near Cadaqués in the east. For seasoned trekkers, there is also the HRP (Haute Randonnée Pyrénéenne), which follows a higher and wilder course in the Pyrenees, crisscrossing the Spanish–French border along the way. It runs largely through the Parc National des Pyrenées in France but also takes in parts of the Parc Nacional d’Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici. In Spain, you can get more general information about the GR routes from the Federación Española de Deportes de Montaña y Escalada (FEDME; Spanish Mountain Sports Federation; fedme.es), though the website is mostly in Spanish only. Tourist offices, refuges and many hotels in the Pyrenees can also supply maps, information on accommodation along the route and more.
Ripoll
The quiet mountain town of RIPOLL, which serves as a good starting point for exploring the Pyrenees, is known as the cradle of Catalunya, as it was here that founding father Guifré el Pélos (Wilfred the Hairy) staked his claim to what became the Autonomous Community of Catalunya. The chief reason to visit is to view the impressive Benedictine Monestir de Santa Maria. Ripoll also holds an international music festival in July and August in the fourteenth-century church of Sant Pere, and is the starting point for a beautiful Via Verde (greenway, viesverdes.cat) – trek or cycle the 15km La Ruta del Ferro i del Carbó (Iron and Coal), which starts near the train station, to Sant Joan de les Abadesses.
Monestir de Santa Maria
Monastery Pl. Abat Oliba • Daily: April–Sept 10am–2pm & 4–7pm; Oct–March 10am–1.30pm & 3.30–6pm • €5.50 • monestirderipoll.cat
One of the few parts of the building to survive a tragic fire, the splendid twelfth-century facade of the west portal of the Monestir de Santa Maria, which was founded some four hundred years earlier, is considered one of Spain’s great works of Romanesque art. The portal showcases a series of sculptures depicting the Creation and other biblical scenes in gorgeous detail – singing angels, the stories of Moses and Solomon and mythical beasts representing the Apostles, among other scenes – giving it its nickname as the “Stone Bible” or “Ripoll Bible”. The cloister has also aged beautifully, while the nave is a replica of the original structure that was built over Guifré el Pélos’ tomb.
Museu Etnogràfic de Ripoll
Pl. Abat Oliba • Tues–Sat 10am–1.30pm & 4–6pm, Sun 10am–2pm • €4 • 972 703 144, museuderipoll.org
The Museu Etnogràfic de Ripoll, one of Catalunya’s first ethnographic museums, explores the history of Ripoll and inland Catalunya through its culture, society, religion and trades, with exhibits on everything from farming methods to folklore. Ripoll had a thriving metalworking industry in the Middle Ages, and later became a production centre for weapons and firearms, and exhibits include ancient keys, forged ironwork and early rifles and other weapons.
DRAGONS AND DEVILS
Pleasant Berga, 30km west of Ripoll, has the usual historical draws – an old town, the remains of a castle – but the reason that it’s on the map, so to speak, is as host of one of Catalunya’s most famous festivals, the Festa del Patum. During Corpus Christi week, Berga’s otherwise staid streets fill with parade floats of pagans and fantasy creatures – the famous gegants, devils, dragons spewing fireworks and dragon-slayers – while revellers dance on the sidelines and behind the floats. The festival is said to be named after the sound of the drum, and you’ll hear the crowd chanting “pa-tum, pa-tum!” throughout. During Patum, you must book accommodation at least a month in advance. Good places to stay include Hotel HCC Ciutat de Berga, Pg. de la Industria 11 (938 214 422, hcchotels.es; €60).
Arrival and information: ripoll

Sant Joan de les Abadesses
Sitting in the verdant Ríu Tur valley 1km northeast of Ripoll, the petite town of SANT JOAN DE LES ABADESSES was built around the monastery of the same name, which was founded by Guifré el Pélos in 887 and named after his daughter. Sant Joan is a pleasant place for a stroll, particularly through the Pl. Mayor to the Gothic bridge over the Ríu Ter.

The Museu de Monestir offers a well-curated overview of the town’s formidable religious history, with sacred artefacts and detailed embroidery and silverware.
Arrival and information: SANT JOAN DE LES ABADESSES

Accommodation
Sant Joan has a couple of welcoming options – or venture into the countryside, where you’ll find a variety of excellent rustic houses.

Hotelet de Sant Joan C/Mestre Andreu 3 872 599 699, hoteletdestjoan.com. A wonderful find in this rustic wedge of Spain, this casual boutique hotel has simple yet stylish rooms, with wood floors, snow-white bed linen and elegant lights. €75

The lovely rooms are the picture of rustic-chic, with lots of gleaming dark wood – from the furnishings to the beamed ceilings – and views of the surrounding green valley. €76
Camprodon
CAMPRODON, 12km east of Sant Joan de les Abadesses, is where you really start to feel like you’re in the mountains: the peaks loom in the distance, the air is crisp and the streets are dotted with ski- and outdoor-gear shops. Camprodon also has an upscale, alpine-holiday air to it, particularly along the broad promenade of Passeig Maristany, where many well-off Catalans have mountain villas. Camprodon’s handsome centrepiece is the sixteenth-century Pont Nou, which spans the Ríu Ter in the middle of town. From here, the main street leads to the lovely Romanesque Sant Pere church, open generally for services only.
Arrival and information: camprodon
By bus Regular Teisa buses from Ripoll stop at a shelter at the southeast edge of town.
Turisme The turisme is on Pl. d’Espanya 1 (Tues–Sat 10am–2pm & 4–7pm, Sun 10am–2pm; 972 740 010, valldecomprodon.org).
Accommodation and eating

Around Camprodon
Beyond Camprodon, appealing mountain villages and trekking trails dot the peaks and Ter valley. This is hiking territory, and many visitors come to this area for outdoor adventure, whether on the trails in summer, or on the slopes of Vallter 2000 in winter. The best way to explore is with your own wheels, though a few buses do crawl through the valley. Villalonga de Ter, 5km from Camprodon, makes for an amiable stopover in your explorations of the valley; it has a Romanesque church, Sant Martí, on the main plaça. Another pleasant stop is the hilltop Tregurá de Dalt, 6km beyond Villalonga, where stone houses line cobbled streets and there are lovely views of the valley and peaks. Both have good accommodation options.
Vallter 2000
vallter2000.com
If you’re looking to ski in the area, try the well-run Vallter 2000, which overlooks the Ter valley and has a decent range of pistes, as well as a variety of offerings for kids, from a good ski school to a Jardí de Neu (snow garden), where the wee ones can play in the snow. The resort also offers plenty of summer activities, from hiking to horseriding.
THE CREMALLERA
The journey of the Cremallera de Vall de Núria, most often just known as the cremallera railway (“zipper” in Catalan), built in 1931, is spectacular: the little train follows the rushing Ríu Freser and then, quite suddenly, begins to scale steep mountainsides along stomach-churning switchbacks, from where you’re rewarded with beautiful views of the river and valley far below. Trains depart from the Ribes-Enllaç station, in the southern part of Ribes, daily year-round except November, when it runs only on the weekends. In high season (July to mid-Sept, plus winter hols), trains run 10–13 times a day; in low season, it’s around 6–7 times. One-way journey time is thirty-five minutes; tickets are €24.80 round-trip in high season. For the latest information, visit valldenuria.cat or call 972 732 020.
Ribes de Freser, Núria and around
The Freser valley extends north of Ripoll to the mountain village of Ribes de Freser and Queralbs before unfolding eastward through a stunning gorge. Ribes de Freser sits at the confluence of three rivers, hemmed in by verdant valleys, and features a small old town and the church of Santa María, which dates back to the eleventh century but was then rebuilt in the 1900s in a modernist style. The village is best known as the starting point for the famous rack-and-pinion cremallera train, which snakes up the mountain to the sanctuary of Núria and its neighbouring ski centre, offering tantalizing views along the way. Ribes de Freser also makes for a pleasant Pyrenean base, thanks to its proximity to the mountains and decent array of accommodation.
Santuari de la Mare de Déu
The Núria valley has long been visited by pilgrims, and the Santuari de la Mare de Déu had its beginnings in a visit by Sant Gil of Nîmes, who came here on retreat in the seventh century. Gil left behind a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary, which became an object of veneration, and eventually a patron saint among local shepherds. The sanctuary consists basically of a parochial church (built in 1911) and a hermitage – a small, ancient-looking mountain church, built in 1615 and refurbished over the years. The overall complex itself is rather plain – it includes the sanctuary, plus several straightforward bars, restaurants and self-catering apartments. Pilgrims still come to visit, and the church holds daily Mass for locals, but the devout are usually outnumbered by skiers in winter and hikers in summer.
Arrival and information: Ribes de Freser, Núria and around
By train Regular trains on the Barcelona–Puigcerdà line stop at the Ribes de Freser (2hr 30min), where you can catch the cremallera train.
Turisme Pl. de l’Ajuntament 3, Ribes de Freser (Mon–Sat 10am–2pm & 5–8pm, Sun 10am–1pm; 972 727 728, vallderibes.cat).
Activities
Hiking The area abounds with good hikes, including the popular trek along the river gorge from Núria to the village of Queralbs (2hr 30min). Those with more stamina can go on a full-day hike through the Gorges of Freser, trekking on the GR11.7 and then returning on another signposted trail. You can take a break along the way at Refugi Coma de Vaca.
Skiing The Vall de Núria ski centre (valldenuria.cat) has plenty of activities for kids, so is popular with families.

The Serra del Cadí
Unfolding in the eastern section of the Western Pyrenees, the verdant Parc Natural Cadí-Moixeró encompasses the massive Serra del Cadí, which has the area’s best hiking and trekking around one of Catalunya’s most recognizable mountains, Pedraforca. The village of Bagà houses the park’s tourist office. The park has a number of staffed refuges, which you can access via treks from the surrounding mountain villages. There are also superb birding opportunities. It’s best to have your own transport, as buses pass only intermittently through the outer villages.
Bagà makes for a good base in the area. It has a tidy little medieval quarter, centred on Pl. Porxada, and a pretty Romanesque-Gothic church. Surrounded by the leafy Gòsol valley, the village of Gòsol, 10km to the west of Saldes (see below), is also a good base. The remains of an eleventh-century castle loom over the village, which is dotted with a few places to stay and a good campsite nearby. Gòsol celebrates its popular annual festival on August 15, with local folk dances, music and cuisine.
PEDRAFORCA: HIKING THE MIGHTY PITCHFORK OF CATALUNYA
Gaze up at Pedraforca, which rises east of Gòsol, and it’s easy to see why it has become one of Catalunya’s most iconic peaks. Its name means “stone pitchfork” because the looming mountain appears cleaved down the middle, resulting in two impressive peaks. The Pedraforca also appears in the coat of arms for Berguedà, the surrounding comarca (region). The mountain is a boon for hikers; most people access it from Saldes, a village at the foot of the mountain. A number of hiking outfits lead treks up Pedraforca, including Pyrenees Trail (pyreneestrals.com), which does a full day-hike, covering 15km and a total ascent of 1000 metres.
Pedraforca is also dotted with a variety of refuges. A ninety-minute trek from Saldes brings you near Refugi Lluís Estasen (1647m; important to reserve ahead in summer), from where you can ascend the 2491m Pedraforca (the full trek up and down takes about 5–6hr). The hike up the mountain reaches the divide between the two summits, where you’ll connect with the path coming up from Gòsol. You’ll find a number of refuges on the mountain; the tourist office in Bagà has up-to-date information on all of them. One popular day-hike from the Refugi Lluís Estasen is to the Refugi Sant Jordi (1570m; staffed generally only in summer) to the east, with the mountain peaks rising up all around you.
REFUGES
Refugi Lluís Estasen 608 315 312. Generally staffed only in summer; call ahead or enquire at park information office. Dorms €15

La Cerdanya
The verdant Cerdanya valley, hemmed in by looming peaks to the north and south, has long shared a geo-cultural affinity with France. The border snakes its way through the middle of the valley, but you can hardly tell where Spain ends and France begins. Catalan is spoken on both sides of the border and, in many ways, Cerdanya seems to function as an independent entity, with customs all its own. As the locals say, it’s not quite Spain, and it’s not quite France – it’s simply La Cerdanya. The only Pyrenean valley running east–west, the Cerdanya is showered with more sunlight than any other part of the range, and is therefore a popular summer spot for hikers and mountain bikers. In winter, skiers flock to La Molina and Masella, the two big ski resorts. Puigcerdà, the capital of Cerdanya, is the transport hub for the area, from where you can catch a train that continues into France – the only still-running trans-Pyrenean rail route, and offering lovely views along the way.
Toses
The small village of TOSES, about 18km west of Ribes de Freser, is perched at 1450m. Its highlight is the church of San Cristòfol, dating from the tenth to twelfth century (open usually for services only). The church is modest but well restored, with a handsome nave, rectangular belfry and reproduction frescoes.
La Molina and La Masella
lamolina.com, masella.com
The combined ski resorts of La Molina and La Masella comprise one of the larger ski areas in the Spanish Pyrenees, with pistes on Tosa d’Alp (2537m; 15km south of Puigcerdà) and a total of 101 runs. If you’re new to skiing, try La Molina, which caters to beginners and has a good ski school. La Masella also has a ski school, and offers extensive runs that appeal to more skilled skiers.
Arrival and accommodation: la molina and la masella
By bus It’s easiest to get around with your own transport, though in the ski season there is an intermittent bus from Puigcerdà (generally departing once in the morning to the resort, and twice in the afternoon back to Puigcerdà).
Accommodation
You’ll find a few options in the area. Many skiers, if they have their own transport, opt to stay in Puigcerdà or other villages in the region.

Hotel Adserà La Molina 972 892 001, hoteladsera.com. This alpine hotel has simple but comfortable rooms, an on-site restaurant with regional food and views of the Cerdanya valley. Ask about discounts and packages, which they offer for ski classes and lift passes. €65
SKIING THE CATALAN PYRENEES
There’s a good reason that the Spanish royal family and other luminaries choose to ski in the Catalan Pyrenees – it’s home to some of the best resorts in Spain. As with most ski regions, often the best way to save is through the package deals offered by many hotels, which include discounts on lift tickets. General prices are €14–25 a day for ski gear (skis, boots, poles), and €25–48 daily for lift passes, with prices varying with the length of time you buy passes for, whether it’s a weekday or the weekend, and the quality of the resort. Note, also, that it’s well worth checking ahead to find out the level of snow, especially in the spring.
The Catalan Pyrenees offer a surprising variety of resorts, catering both to first-timers and advanced skiers. Intermediate skiers will find plenty of thrilling terrain at La Masella in La Cerdanya, which now also offers skiing at night on Fridays and Saturdays along 10km on thirteen slopes. Also popular for expert skiers is Boí-Taüll on the western boundary of Aigüestortes and the premiere Baqueira-Beret in the Val d’Aran. The best resorts for newbies and families are Espot Esquí on the eastern boundary of the Parc Nacional de Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici, and La Molina near La Masella.
Puigcerdà
Perched above the breezy union of the rivers Segre and Querol (puig is Catalan for “hill”; cerdà comes from Cerdanya), with the Pyrenees looming grandly above, hilltop PUIGCERDÀ is one of the prettier border towns you’ll come across. With its cluster of budget lodgings and proximity to ski resorts, the town is a busy stopover for skiers, hikers and mountain bikers.
Founded in 1177, Puigcerdà has a rich history, but sadly most of its old buildings were destroyed in the Civil War, and its aged roots are best reflected in the layout and design of its narrow streets and plaças. Among the monuments that were spared is the campanaria (bell tower) in graceful Pl. de Santa Maria, while the well-preserved Pl. Cabrinetty (near Pl. de l’Ajuntament) has beautiful balconies and porticoes.
Church of Sant Domènec and around
Pg. 10 d’Abril • Generally open for services only: daily 8pm, plus Sun mornings and occasional weekday mornings; church opens 1hr before the service
The church of Sant Domènec was built in 1291 and restored after the Civil War. The church features an elegant portal, while inside is a series of fourteenth-century Gothic paintings. Next door sits the convent of Sant Domènec, which now houses a library, a historical archive and sacred artefacts.
Arrival and information: Puigcerdà
By train and bus The train and bus stations sit at the bottom of the hill, from which a free funicular (daily 5.30am–midnight) travels up to Pl. de l’Ajuntament in the middle of town. Several trains daily connect Puigcerdà with Barcelona (3hr), via Vic and Ripoll. Rodalies (local) trains also run 4–5 times daily from Puigcerdà to Latour de Carol in France (10min), from which there are connections to Toulouse (2hr 30min–3hr).
Turisme C/Querol 1, near the Pl. de l’Ajuntament (June to mid-Sept Mon–Fri 9.30am–1pm & 4–7pm, Sat 10am–1pm & 4–7pm, Sun 10am–1pm; rest of the year closed Sun & Mon; 972 880 542).

Eating and drinking
Puigcerdà has a range of restaurants, most tending towards homely regional cuisine; take a twirl around Pl. de Santa Maria, which has plenty of eating spots.

El Caliu C/Alfons Primer 1 972 140 825, elcaliu.com. Everything from beef tenderloin to salmon and sardines is served at this inviting spot. Dishes €11–15. Daily 1–3.30pm & 8.30–10.30pm; sometimes closed Wed.

Llívia
In 1659, the town of LLÍVIA officially became a Spanish enclave within France, a geographical oddity that has garnered a mention in guidebooks ever since. Though the Spanish ceded 33 villages to France that year, tiny Llívia, deemed a town, remained Spanish. Just 6km from Puigcerdà, it’s easy to reach on foot, or you can take a bus.

La Seu d’Urgell
Known to locals simply as Seu, the pleasant town of LA SEU D’URGELL, capital of the comarca of Alt Urgell, sits amid looming peaks, with Andorra just 10km to the north and the valleys of the rocky Serra del Cadí nearby. As the seat (seu) of the regional archbishopric since the sixth century and home to an outdoor market held continuously since 1029 (on Tues and Sat), Seu has a formidable history, which is revealed in its well-preserved medieval quarter, twisting alleys and imposing Catedral.
The pleasantly mysterious medieval quarter is a small warren of narrow, arcaded streets. Carrer dels Canonges, the oldest street, cuts through its heart, and is lined with centuries-old buildings like Cal Roger, believed to have been a pilgrim’s hostel, and which reveals wooden ceiling beams and some fourteenth-century Gothic carvings (enquire at the turisme about visiting).

WHITEWATER ADRENALINE RUSH
The Noguera Pallaresa’s mighty flow is legendary, and draws thrill-seekers from around Spain and further afield. The original rafts were primitive – logs lashed together – but could withstand the frothy waters, and were ridden by raiers (rafters) to the sawmills of La Pobla de Segur. These days, the rafts are of the inflatable variety, and exciting whitewater trips are offered by operators throughout the region.
The most popular section of the river is between Llavorsí and Rialp, but tour companies offer a range of trips, each more rugged and scenic than the last. The rafting season is from April to early September; some outfitters also offer rafting programmes in March and October. In season, trips are run daily, usually in the late morning and lasting 1–2 hours on the water. Two-hour trips start at €35, and go up to €70–95 for longer rides, including lunch. The tourist office has a list of recommended rafting operators, including those listed below. Most offer other activities as well:

The Noguera Pallaresa valley
Catalunya’s most famous whitewater-rafting river, the Noguera Pallaresa, churns through the lush valley of the same name. The river has long been an important source of hydroelectric power, and large power plants sit at various points along its banks. The raiers (logger-raftsmen) of La Pobla de Segur used to ride rafts of logs from the Pallars Forest all the way south to the lowlands.
The town of Sort, north of La Pobla de Segur, has become the region’s whitewater-rafting hub, with a host of aquatic-adventure shops. If you’re using public transport, you’ll likely arrive or depart from La Pobla de Segur, which has most of the valley’s connections to and from Barcelona and Lleida.

Next to the village, an old stone bridge leads to the beautiful twelfth-century Monasterio de Sant Maria. Though it’s closed to the public, the area around it is lovely for a wander. Just beyond Gerri de la Sal is a tunnel, alongside which the old road hugs the rocky side of the mountain and is open to hikers and bikers.

Parc Nacional d’Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici
gencat.cat/parcs/aiguestortes
One of nine in Spain, Catalunya’s largest national park, the Parc Nacional d’Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici, encompasses soaring peaks topping 3000m and lush meadows irrigated by more than four hundred lakes, streams, waterfalls and impressive glacial valleys. Established in 1955, the park is comprised of valleys blanketed in pine and fir forests, while wild animals like the isard, a small antelope also known as the chamois, roam the terrain. You might even spot a golden eagle or black woodpecker, both common here.
Hiking and trekking opportunities abound, from easy walks around sparkling lakes to serious treks up the mountain. The Sant Nicolas valley in the west features numerous glacial lakes, as well as the meanders of Aigüestortes (Twisted Waters). In the east lies the massive Estany de Sant Maurici (Sant Maurici Lake), at the head of the Escrita valley. In the winter, you can also cross-country ski through the park, though there are no marked trails.
The park’s western sector is best reached from the Vall de Boí – to explore Aigüestortes, the approach is generally from Boí via El Pont de Suert; the eastern portion, including Lake Sant Maurici, is accessed via Espot, which lies just beyond the eastern border of the park. The easiest starting point for the higher mountains is Capdella, south of the park. If you’ll be hiking for several days at a time between June and September, you can stay at any of the refuges throughout the park. Either visitor centre can give you a list.
arrival and information: Parc Nacional d’Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici
By car and taxi Private cars are not allowed in the park, but 4WD taxis travel from the main square in Boí to the information booth at the entrance; taxis operate July to Sept 15 (8am or 9am–7pm) and rest of the year (9am–6pm) from €6 one-way. The closest you can get to the park in your car is La Molina car park, near the boundary. When this fills up, try the La Farga car park, about 1.5km east. You can arrange for a 4WD taxi to take you from either car park further uphill. When you arrive at the park entrance from Boí (3.5km) it’s then about another 3.5km to the crashing waterfalls of Aigüestortes. It’s important to keep track of the weather, as it can greatly affect accessibility. In the cold season, it can be difficult to access certain roads.
Visitor centres There are park information booths at the entrance and also above the waterfalls (both generally open July–Sept daily 9.30am–2pm & 4–7pm). You can also pick up trail guides and park maps at the visitor centres in Boí and Espot.
Maps Editorial Alpina (editorialalpina.com) has excellent, detailed topographical maps of the park.
Entrance Entry to the park is free.
Safety It’s always a good idea to alert the refuge staff before you set out on treks, any time of year.
Accommodation
Refuges Accommodation in and around the park encompasses around twenty refuges, both in the park and in the park’s peripheral zone. The refuges usually open in the summer (when most are staffed), Easter and sometimes Christmas, as well as on selected weekends and school holidays during the rest of the year. Refuges are usually equipped with bunk beds and have a basic meal service. Prices generally range between €17 and €40/person. Most refuges are fully booked during July and August, so you’ll need to reserve ahead, which you can do via lacentralderefugis.com or by calling 973 641 681.
Camping Camping in the park is officially forbidden, though you can camp in the peripheral zone.
HIKES AND RIDES FROM CAPDELLA
There are a number of popular treks from Capdella, including the half-day hike to the inviting Refugi Colomina, set amid mountain lakes. You’ll find various treks around the Refugi Colomina, including to Estany Llong, by way of Estany Tort. You can also access the park on the teleférico (cable car; July–Sept; around 9 departures daily, 8am–6pm; €18 round trip). The cable car travels from the Saliente reservoir (about 7km north of Capdella) to the Estany Gento, which is near an entrance of the park – on its fifteen-minute trip, the cable car climbs 450m. It was originally constructed in 1981 to transport materials and workers while the Saliente power station was being built, and it’s said to be one of the cable cars with the greatest transport capacities in Europe; it was opened to the public in 1991.
Vall de Fosca
The verdant Vall de Fosca, which extends just south of the park, received its name Fosca (“dark”) because it’s surrounded by steep slopes that obscure the sun. Tiny Capdella is perched at its northernmost point and, at 1420m, is the highest of the fifteen or so tiny villages and settlements that are sprinkled south through the valley, including Espui and La Torre de Capdella. Capdella makes for a good jumping-off point into the park, and is the village closest to the teleférico.
Arrival and information: vall de fosca
By bus Buses travel from La Pobla de Segur to Capdella (30min).
Turisme The Vall de Fosca turisme is in the ajuntament of Torre de Capdella on the Pl. Major (daily Mon–Fri 9am–3pm, Mon & Thurs also 4.30–8.30pm; 973 663 001, vallfosca.net), 4km south of Espui.
Espot, Espot Esquí and around
ESPOT is a cosy mountain town hemmed in by a lovely green valley, which has increasingly been built up as a tourist centre. In the winter, skiers pass through on their way to Espot Esquí (granpallars.com), just south of town, which has nearly thirty alpine trails.
You can access the park from Espot, which lies about 7km from the Estany de Sant Maurici. Upon arrival at the estany (lake), you’ll want to get your camera out: it’s a beautiful scene, the lake fringed by wilderness and dominated by the spires of Els Encants (“The Enchanted Ones”; 2700m).
Arrival and information: Espot, Espot Esquí and around
By bus and taxi The daily buses from Barcelona, Lleida and La Pobla de Segur to Esterri d’Àneu stop at the Espot turn-off. From there, it’s a steep 8km uphill walk to Espot, and then another similar distance to get to the park.
By taxi The quickest and easiest way to the park is by taxi, which travel from Espot to Estany de Sant Maurici. Taxis generally depart from the park information offices (July–Sept 8am–6pm or 7pm, rest of year 9am–6pm; from around €7 one-way).
Casa del Parc information office C/Sant Maurici 5, at the edge of Espot (June–Sept daily 9am–1pm & 3.30–6.45pm; Oct–May Mon–Sat 9am–2pm & 3.30–5.45pm, Sun 9am–2pm; 973 624 036). Has maps of the park and up-to-date weather reports.

POPULAR HIKES AND REFUGES
One of the most popular (though challenging in parts) hikes is to traverse the park from east to west, starting at the Estany de Sant Maurici. The full trek, all the way to Boí, takes about 9–10 hours, but you can shorten it by hopping in a taxi for the last part from the park entrance to Boí. Roughly halfway along it sits the Refugi de Estany Llong.
The northern section of the park offers a wealth of treks for the adventurous and well-equipped – the Espot park information office has detailed maps of trails – as well as refuges, including the top-notch Refugi de Colomèrs, the Refugi de Restanca and the Ventosa i Calvell, near Estany Negre.
Another good hike from the east is to Refugi Josep Maria Blanc, which lies southwest of Espot and is surrounded by lush valleys. The hike from Espot to the refuge takes 3–4 hours. From here, the hike continues to the Colomina refuge, which you can reach in another 3–4 hours.

Extending just west of the national park is the lush Vall de Boí, anchored by the mountain village of Boí. The highlights of the valley are its lovely Romanesque churches, the most remarkable of their kind in Catalunya. In 2000, the churches were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, who described them as “an especially pure and consistent example of Romanesque art in a virtually untouched rural setting”. And it is this setting that leaves the lasting impression – the beautiful simplicity of the early Romanesque architecture is magnified by the utter alpine stillness surrounding them. The churches, all built between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries, were constructed of local materials, like stone, slate and wood – and their most striking features are their elegant belfries which, in the case of Taüll, rises an impressive six storeys. Note that many of the church frescoes are reproductions – though excellent ones, to be sure – because the originals have been moved to MNAC in Barcelona. In addition to the valley’s two finest churches in Taüll, other Romanesque beauties worth a visit are Sant Feliu in Barruera, Nativitat in Durro and Santa Eulàlia in Erill la Vall.
Boí
The pleasant town of BOÍ serves as a good starting point for exploring the surrounding region, both for the Romanesque churches – you can walk a variety of signposted trails from Boí to neighbouring churches – and also the national park, an entrance to which lies 3.5km from town. Boí also has a helpful park information office, and its own Romanesque church, the twelfth-century Sant Joan: parts of the original belfry are still intact, and the church has three naves. As with other churches in the area, the frescoes are reproductions but nonetheless eye-catching, and include images of mythical animals.
Estany de Cavallers
Five kilometres north of Boí is the Estany de Cavallers (Cavallers Lake), where you can pick up trails towards the lake-filled landscape in the northwest section of the park, which are presided over by the Besiberri and Montrarto peaks. A good refuge in the northwest of the park is Ventosa i Calvell.
Taüll
TAÜLL, 3km east of Boí, is home to two of the valley’s best-known Romanesque churches. Sant Climent, consecrated in 1123, features an exquisite six-storey square belfry that rises gracefully above the town. The church’s emblematic Romanesque murals were created by the so-called Master of Taüll, and transferred to Barcelona in 1922. Particularly striking is the image of Christ Pantocrator (Christ in Majesty) in the apse. Taüll’s second Romanesque icon is the church of Santa Maria, with its four-storey belfry.

The valley is also home to a ski centre, Boí-Taüll, which lies 11km southeast of Taüll. The resort has nearly fifty pistes and lifts that reach up to 2750m, and covers an area of about 45km. They offer an array of classes for beginners, and a good family ski programme. Call ahead, as the resort may be undergoing some changes and may therefore have limited hours.

Val d’Aran
Nudging the French border in the far northwest of the Catalan Pyrenees, the lush Val d’Aran has long been geographically and culturally distinct from the rest of the Pyrenees. You can see the disparity of its architecture – French-style chalets dot the mountains – and you can hear it on the streets: the language here is Aranés, a mix of Gascon French and Catalan. The valley drains towards the Atlantic and splits into the Garonne River, whose waters eventually feed the vineyards of Bordeaux.
The Val d’Aran joined Catalunya-Aragón in the twelfth century and was fully given over to Catalunya in 1389. Completely ringed by high peaks, however – some reaching over 3000m – it has always been difficult to access. For most of the valley’s history, the only routes in from the Spanish side crossed the tricky Bonaigua or Bossòst passes, both accessible only in summer. This changed only in 1948, when the first Vielha Tunnel opened on the N230 highway.
The valley’s capital and commercial centre is Vielha, a beautiful alpine town with one foot in the past and the other in the very contemporary present, as a luxury resort. In winter, the Val d’Aran becomes upscale skiing country, drawing folks from all over Spain and France. While the area still reveals pockets of traditional life, it has undergone a massive shift in the last several decades, with upmarket apartments replacing family dwellings, and much of the retail catering to slick skiers. The Spanish royal family, along with the fit and fabulous, frequent Baqueira-Beret, one of Spain’s premier ski resorts.
The Val d’Aran is divided into three sectors: Vielha e Mijaran (Middle Aran), Baish Aran (Lower Aran; northwest of Vielha near the French border) and Nau Aran (Upper Aran; east of Vielha). Both Upper and Lower Aran are ripe for exploration, each of their mountain villages more lovely than the last. You’ll find plenty of hiking and trekking opportunities – trails meander all over the valley. You could easily spend a day or two hiking from one tiny village to the next, enjoying a country meal at one, and bedding down in a rustic farmhouse in the next. Salardú and Arties make for pleasant stopovers in Nau Aran.
GO WILD
The Val d’Aran has long drawn the crowds for its alpine activities. These days, it’s also drawing crowds for its alpine animals. Wildlife-watching has been growing in popularity in the Val d’Aran, with the tourist office (see above) expanding its wildlife coverage, and with tour companies, such as WildWatching Spain (wildwatchingspain.com) and Aran Experience (aranexperience.com), offering a variety of wildlife treks, including springtime photo treks and summer birding. Among the animals you might spot are, in spring and summer, the Pyrenean capercaillie, black woodpecker, brown bear, bearded vulture and marmot; and in winter, the spotted woodpecker, mountain passerines and golden eagle. The wildlife park Aran Park in Bossòst (April–June & Sept–Oct daily 9.30am–6pm, July–Aug daily 9.30am–7pm; €14;. aran-park.es) features a wide range of animals in a natural setting, including deer and bears; in 2017, the park introduced more wild animals, including grey wolves.
Vielha
The valley centres on the bustling town of VIELHA, which goes through a metamorphosis in winter: when the snow descends, so too do the slickly outfitted skiers, who crowd the slopes, gear shops and restaurants. After the snow melts, Vielha reverts to its small-town self, when the hilly streets get quiet, and the bars are again the domain of the locals. The tiny old quarter features the parish church of Sant Miquèu, with a twelfth-century wooden Crist de Mijaran, a superb example of Romanesque art.
Museu dera Val d’Aran
C/Major 26 • Tues & Thurs–Sat 10am–7pm, Wed 10am–8pm, Sun 10am–2.30pm • €4.50

Baqueira-Beret
973 639 010, baqueira.es
The massive Baqueira-Beret ski resort has more development than any other in the area and imbues the valley with a stylish sheen. It’s one of Spain’s choicest resorts, and has the crowd to match. Discerning skiers, most famously Spain’s king himself, flock to its 70-plus pistes, which cover up to 105km – making it one of Spain’s largest resorts. The resort amenities – groomed pistes, numerous chairlifts, a top-notch ski staff – rival the Pyrenean scenery of frosted peaks piercing the bright-blue sky. If you don’t want to go for the pricey resort accommodation, do what many do: stay for considerably less at a nearby village, such as Salardú or Vielha.
Salardú
The Val d’Aran contains over thirty hillside villages, most with their own Romanesque church. SALARDÚ, which lies just west of Baqueira-Beret, is one of the valley’s larger settlements, with the thirteenth-century church of Sant Andreu (open for services; enquire at turisme about other times) standing tall in its centre. Take a look at the detailed portal and, inside, the carefully restored frescoes.
Salardú has a decent tourist infrastructure – several options for lodging and food – but also a rugged alpine personality. Call ahead to your hotel in the non-snow season, as they sometimes close.
Arrival and information: Salardú
By bus From June to Sept, one daily service runs from Barcelona to Vielha via La Pobla de Segur, Llavorsí and Salardú (about 5hr 30min).

Bossòst
An enticing blend of history, alpine beauty and local cuisine, the village of BOSSÒST lies roughly equidistant to Vielha (15km to the southeast) and the French border, just to the north. Bossòst’s Romanesque highlight is the beautiful twelfth-century church, crowned by a well-preserved bell tower, and with apses designed in the Lombard (early Romanesque) style. Bossòst is near the gorgeous Portilhon mountain pass – accessible via driving and hiking – which reveals one of the finest viewpoints in the area: Còth de Baretja, looking out over the majestic Val D’Aran.
Arrival and information: BosSòst
By bus From June to Sept, a bus runs regularly in the valley, connecting Bossòst and Vielha (20min); in winter, the bus runs on a reduced schedule, if at all.

< Back to Catalunya



Southern Catalunya
The great triangle of land south of Barcelona may be one of the lesser-visited wedges of Catalunya – but it shouldn’t be. This wonderfully varied area encompasses a sun-speckled coast, a trinity of medieval monasteries and the historically rich provincial capitals of Tarragona and Lleida.
West of Barcelona lies cava country, where you can tour Catalunya’s best-known cava producers, especially around Sant Sadurní d’Anoia. On the coast, just south of Barcelona, sits vibrant Sitges, a major gay summer destination that’s also home to some fine modernista architecture. Beyond this is the Costa Daurada – the coastline that stretches from just north of Tarragona to the Delta de l’Ebre – which suffered less exploitation than the Costa Brava. It’s easy enough to see why it was so neglected – the shoreline can be drab, with beaches that are narrow and characterless, backed by sparse villages – but there are exceptions, and if all you want to do is relax by a beach for a while, there are several down-to-earth and perfectly functional possibilities.
The Costa Daurada really begins to pay dividends, however, if you can forget about the beaches temporarily and spend a couple of days in Tarragona. It’s a city with a solid Roman past – reflected in an array of impressive ruins and monuments – and makes a handy springboard for trips inland into Lleida province. South of Tarragona, Catalunya peters out in the lagoons and marshes of the Delta de l’Ebre, a riverine wetland rich in birdlife – perfect for slow boat trips, fishing and sampling the local seafood.
Inland attractions are fewer, and many travelling this way are inclined to head on out of Catalunya altogether, not stopping until they reach Zaragoza. It’s true that much of the region is flat, rural and dull, but nonetheless it would be a mistake to miss the outstanding monastery at Poblet, only an hour or so inland from Tarragona. A couple of other nearby towns and monasteries – notably medieval Montblanc and Santes Creus – add a bit more interest to the region, while by the time you’ve rattled across the huge plain that encircles the provincial capital of Lleida you’ll have earned a night’s rest. Pretty much off the tourist trail, Lleida is the start of the dramatic road and train routes into the western foothills of the Catalan Pyrenees, and is only two and a half hours from Zaragoza.

Vilafranca del Penedès
Pleasant VILAFRANCA DEL PENEDÈS, capital of the comarca of Alt Penedès, lies about 45km southwest of Barcelona, and offers the twin pleasures of history and wine. It was founded in the eleventh century in an attempt to attract settlers to land retaken from the expelled Moors and in time became a prosperous market centre. This character is still in evidence today, with a compact old town with narrow streets and arcaded squares adorned with restored medieval mansions. In the centre, around Pl. de Sant Joan, a Saturday market sells everything from farm-fresh produce to clothes, household goods and handicrafts. The vineyards of Vilafranca are all scattered in the countryside out of town – one of the closest (and most famous) is Torres.
The Festa Major (festamajor.info), at the end of August and the first couple of days in September, brings the place to a standstill. Dances and parades clog the streets, while the festival is most widely known for its display of castellers – teams of people competing to build human towers.

CAVA COUNTRY
Cava – Spain’s answer to champagne – is grown largely in the Penedès region, which also produces quality white wines and robust reds. “Cava” simply means cellar, and was the word chosen when the French objected to the word champagne. The eminently drinkable, and very affordable, sparkling wine is usually defined by its sugar content: seco (literally “dry”) has around half the sugar of a semi-seco (“semi-dry”). In addition to selling bottles of bubbly, the region’s famous bodegas often offer informative tours and tastings, and are located in stunning properties, attractions in themselves. Most can be found in the Penedès region near the town of Sant Sadurní d’Anoia, about 30km west of Barcelona, and in the countryside around Vilafranca de Penedès, 15km southwest of Sant Sadurní. And, while the Penedès continues to be dominated by the big names – Codorníu, Freixenet and Torres – a wave of small-batch wineries are beginning to present strong competition, many of them offering organic bubbly, like Parés Baltà. There are regular trains from Estació-Sants Barcelona to Sant Sadurní (40min) and Vilafranca de Penedès (50min). Also, Codorníu offers bus service to and from Barcelona; see their website for details.

THE WINERIES AROUND PENEDÈS
Bodegas Torres Finca el Maset, Pacs del Penedès, 3km northwest of Vilafranca de Penedès 938 177 487, torres.es.

Opposite the much-restored Gothic church of Santa Maria, the Vinseum features an impressive collection, including antique casks, wine-themed art through the ages and historic porrons, a traditional Catalan wine pitcher with a thin spout, designed to pour vino in a stream directly into your mouth, so that it can be shared around a table. (In George Orwell’s Homage to Catalonia, he humorously recounts his experience in drinking from one.) Rivalling the museum’s exhibits is the building itself, a thirteenth-century royal palace that was once the seat of the Catalan-Aragon crown. After your visit, sample local wines at the Vinmuseum Tavern.

Sitges
SITGES, 40km from Barcelona, is definitely the highlight of this stretch of coast. Established in the 1960s as a holiday town, whose liberal attitudes openly challenged the rigidity of Franco’s Spain, it has now become the great weekend escape for young Barcelonans, who have created a resort very much in their own image. It’s also a noted gay holiday destination, with the nightlife to match. Indeed, if you don’t like vigorous action of all kinds, you’d be wise to avoid Sitges in the summer – staid it isn’t. Finding a place to stay in peak season can be a challenge, unless you arrive early in the day or book well in advance. None of this deters the varied and generally well-heeled visitors, however – nor should it, since Sitges as a sort of Barcelona-on-Sea is definitely worth experiencing for at least one night.
The town itself is appealing and attractive: a former fishing village whose well-maintained houses and narrow streets have attracted artists and opted-out intellectuals for a century or so. But, it’s the beach that brings most people to Sitges, and it’s not hard to find, with two strands right in town, to the west of the church. From here, a succession of platjas of varying quality and crowdedness stretches west for a couple of kilometres down the coast. A long seafront promenade flanks the beach, and all along there are beach bars, restaurants, showers and watersports facilities. Towards the end of the western stretch of beach, you’ll reach nudist beaches, a couple of which are exclusively gay.

Rusiñol organized five modernista festivals in Sitges between 1892 and 1899, and the town flourished as a major modernista centre under his patronage. Magnificently tiled rooms display an extraordinary array of paintings, artefacts and decorative ironwork gathered by Rusiñol, including works by Rusiñol himself, contemporaries such as Picasso, and even a couple of minor El Grecos that he bought when the painter’s reputation was much less elevated than it is today.

Housed in Sitges’ former fish market and a similarly venerable adjoining building, the Fundació Stämpfli is home to the wide-ranging contemporary art collection of Swiss-born artist Peter Stämpfli and his wife, Anna Maria, who have been active members of the local art scene since the 1970s. The works – some eighty paintings, sculptures and more by international artists such as Erró, Gérard Fromanger and Stämpfli himself – offer a sweeping view of various art movements from the past fifty years. The renovated space in which the collection is presented is simple but beautiful, with a vaulted, wood-beamed ceiling and gleaming floors.
CARNAVAL AND FANTASY IN SITGES
Carnaval in Sitges (Feb/March) is outrageous, thanks largely to the gay community. The official programme of parades and masked balls is complemented by an unwritten but widely recognized schedule of events. The climax is the Tuesday late-night parade, in which exquisitely dressed drag queens swan about the streets in high heels, twirling lacy parasols and coyly fanning themselves. Bar doors stand wide open, bands play, and processions and celebrations go on until four in the morning.
If you’re a fan of fantasy, don’t miss the annual Sitges Film Festival (cinemasitges.com), one of the world’s premiere fantasy and horror film festivals. The festival has also expanded to embrace other genres and attracts some big-name actors and directors. It takes place over ten days in late October at venues around the town (information and venues from the turisme). In the summer, the city government usually hosts outdoor concerts at the various museums and gardens, including opera, jazz and classical guitar. Enquire at the tourist office.

The Casa Bacardi, housed in the historic Mercat Vell, explores the history of Bacardi rum – and its connection to Sitges – culminating in a rum tasting. Casa Bacardi also offers cocktail-making classes (€40) on weekday evenings at 6pm and 9pm.

Accommodation
There are dozens of hotels of all types and prices in Sitges, but it’s a good idea to reserve in high season as they fill up quickly. If you arrive without a reservation, a short walk through the central streets and along the front (particularly Pg. de la Ribera) reveals most of the possibilities. Come out of season (after Oct and before May) and the high prices tend to soften a little.

In summer, this is basically one long run of disco-bars, pumping music out into the late evening, interspersed with the odd restaurant or fancier cocktail bar, all with outdoor tables vying for your euros.

SITGES’ GAY SCENE

Most of the bars and clubs are centred around Pl. Indústria and in the triangle made up by Carrer Espalter, Carrer Sant Francesc and Carrer Parellades. Sitges’ clubs are liveliest in the summer, when they’re open Friday and Saturday nights and sometimes during the week; in winter, hours vary and may be limited. Most clubs open no earlier than midnight and stay hopping until the wee hours.

Tarragona
Sited on a rocky hill, sheer above the sea, TARRAGONA has a formidable ancient past. Settled originally by Iberians and then Carthaginians, it was later used as the base for the Roman conquest of the peninsula, which began in 218 BC with Scipio’s march south against Hannibal. The fortified city became an imperial resort and, under Augustus, Tarraco was named capital of Rome’s eastern Iberian province – the most elegant and cultured city of Roman Spain, boasting at its peak a quarter of a million inhabitants. Temples and monuments were built in and around the city and, despite a history of seemingly constant sacking and looting since Roman times, it’s this distinguished past which still asserts itself throughout modern Tarragona.
Time spent in the handsome upper town quickly shows what attracted the emperors to the city: strategically – and beautifully – placed, it’s a fine setting for some splendid Roman remains and a few excellent museums. There’s an attractive medieval section, too, while the rocky coastline below conceals a couple of reasonable beaches. If there’s a downside, it’s that Tarragona is today the second-largest port in Catalunya, so the views aren’t always unencumbered – though the fish in the Serrallo fishing quarter is consistently good and fresh. Furthermore, the city’s ugly outskirts to the south have been steadily degraded by new industries – chemical and oil refineries and a nuclear power station – which do little for Tarragona’s character as a resort.
Orientation
The city divides clearly into two parts: a predominantly medieval, walled upper town (where you’ll spend most of your time) known as La Part Alta, and the prosperous modern centre below, referred to as Eixample, or the Centre Urbà. Between the two cuts is the Rambla Nova, a sturdy provincial rival to Barcelona’s, lined with fashionable cafés and restaurants, culminating at its southern end with the lovely Balcó del Mediterràni, overlooking the sea. Parallel, and to the east, lies the Rambla Vella, marking – as its name suggests – the start of the old town. To either side of the rambles are scattered a profusion of relics from Tarragona’s Roman past, including various temples and parts of the forum, theatre and amphitheatre. Note that some of the most impressive monuments are a fair way out, but there’s enough within walking distance to occupy a good day’s sightseeing and to provide a vivid impression of life in Tarragona in imperial Roman times.
Museu Nacional Arqueològic
Pl. del Rei • June–Sept Tues–Sat 9.30am–8.30pm, Sun 10am–2pm; Oct–May Tues–Sat 9.30am–6pm & 4–7pm, Sun 10am–2pm • €4.50 (includes the Museu i Necròpolis Paleocristians) • 977 236 209, mnat.cat
The most stimulating exhibition in town is housed in adjacent buildings off Pl. del Rei. The splendid Museu Nacional Arqueològic is a marvellous reflection of the richness of imperial Tarraco. Its huge collection is well laid out, starting in the basement with a section of the old Roman wall preserved in situ. On other floors are thematic displays on the various remains and buildings around the city, accompanied by pictures, text and relics, as well as whole rooms devoted to inscriptions, sculpture, ceramics, jewellery – even a series of anchors retrieved from the sea. More importantly, there’s an unusually complete collection of mosaics, exemplifying the stages of development from the plain black-and-white patterns of the first century AD to the elaborate polychrome pictures of the second and third centuries.
JOINT TICKETS IN TARRAGONA
The museums and monuments of Tarragona offer a couple of options for joint tickets. The Museu Nacional Arqueològic and the Museu i Necròpolis Paleocristians offer joint entry for €4.50 (see mnat.cat for details). And most of the rest of Tarragona’s sights – including the Passeig Arqueològic Muralles, Forum de la Colonia, Amfiteatre, Circ Roma and Casa Castellarnau – also have their own joint ticket for €11.05 (for more info, check tarragona.cat).
Museu i Necròpolis Paleocristians
Avda. Ramón i Cajal 78 • March–May & Oct Tues–Sat 9.30am–1.30pm & 3–6pm, Sun 10am–2pm; June–Sept Tues–Sat 10am–1.30pm & 4–8pm, Sun 10am–2pm; Nov–Feb Tues–Sat 9.30am–1.30pm & 3–5.30pm, Sun 10am–2pm • €4.50 (includes the Museu Nacional Arqueològic) • mnat.cat • Walk 20min out of the centre down Avda. Ramón i Cajal, which runs west off Rambla Nova
The most interesting remains in town are those of the ancient Necropolis. Here, both pagan and Christian tombs have been uncovered, spanning a period from the third to the sixth century AD. The small Museu i Necropolis Paleocristians features sarcophagi and some of the most fascinating finds, such as an ivory doll with moveable arms and legs, and you can peek at the main burial grounds through the fence. Most of the relics attest to Tarragona’s importance as a centre of Christianity: St Paul preached here, and the city became an important Visigothic bishopric after the break-up of Roman power.
Passeig Arqueològic Muralles
Portal del Roser, Avda. Catalunya • Mid-May to Sept Tues–Sat 10am–9pm, Sun 10am–3pm; rest of year Tues–Sat 10am–7pm, Sun 10am–3pm • €3.30 or €11.05 joint ticket • 977 245 796, taragona.cat
The Passeig Arqueològic Muralles is a promenade that encircles the northern half of the old town. From the entrance at the Portal del Roser, a path runs between Roman walls of the third century BC and the sloping, outer fortifications erected by the British in 1709 to secure the city during the War of the Spanish Succession. Megalithic walls built by the Iberians are excellently preserved in places, too, particularly two awesome gateways; the huge blocks used in their construction are quite distinct from the more refined Roman additions. Vantage points (and occasional telescopes) give views across the plain behind the city and around to the sea, while various objects are displayed within the passeig: several Roman columns, a fine bronze statue of Augustus and eighteenth-century cannons still defending the city’s heights. Just beyond the entrance on the right, a small doorway leads up to the battlements from where you get fine views of the old city.
Forum
Pl. del Forum • Mid-May to Sept Tues–Sat 10am–9pm, Sun 10am–3pm; rest of year Tues–Sat 10am–7pm, Sun 10am–3pm • €3.30 or €11.05 joint ticket • 977 242 501, tarragona.cat
In the centre of town, the Roman forum, or rather forums, have also survived, since – as provincial capital – Tarragona sustained both a ceremonial Forum Provincial (the scant remnants of which are displayed on Pl. del Forum) and a Forum de la Colonia on C/Lleida, whose more substantial remains are on the western side of Rambla Nova, near the Mercat Central. Located on the flat land near the port, this was the commercial centre of imperial Tarraco and the main meeting place for locals for three centuries. The site, which contained temples and small shops arranged around a porticoed square, has been split by a main road: a footbridge now connects the two halves where you can see a water cistern, house foundations, fragments of stone inscriptions and four elegant columns.
HUMAN CASTLES
It’s not often that you’ll come across a group of grown men and women who willingly climb onto each other’s back to form a tall, if a bit wobbly, human tower. But when you do, it’s a sight to behold. Catalunya’s famous castellers – teams of people competing to build human towers – originated in Valls, near Tarragona, at the end of the eighteenth century. Over time, the rest of Catalunya embraced the tradition, and castells now form a part of festivals throughout the region. The impressive castells can loom up to ten human storeys tall, and are completed by a small child scrambling to the very top.
Castells are a feature of Tarragona’s annual Festival of Santa Tecla in mid-September. To learn more about the history, pay a visit to Tarragona’s Casa de la Festa, Via Augusta 4 (end June to end Sept Tues–Sat 11am–2pm & 5–9pm, Sun 11am–2pm; rest of year Tues & Wed 9am–1pm, Thurs & Fri 9am–1pm & 5–7pm, Sat 10am–2pm & 5–7pm, Sun 11am–2pm; free; 977 220 086). The Festa Major of Vilafranca del Penedès in late August also showcases castells.
Amfiteatre
Parc del Miracle • Mid-May to Sept Tues–Sat 10am–9pm, Sun 10am–3pm; rest of year Tues–Sat 10am–7pm, Sun 10am–3pm • €3.30 or €11.05 joint ticket • tarragona.cat
A group of Tarragona’s tangible Roman remains lie close to each other at the seaward end of the Rambla Vella. Most rewarding is the Amfiteatre, built into the green slopes of Parc del Miracle. The tiered seats backing onto the sea are original, and from the top you can look north, up the coast, to the headland; the rest of the seating was reconstructed in 1969–70, along with the surviving tunnels and structural buildings.
Circ Roma and Pretori
Rambla Vella, Pl. del Rei • Mid-May to Sept Tues–Sat 10am–9pm, Sun 10am–3pm; rest of year Tues–Sat 10am–7pm, Sun 10am–3pm • €3.30 or €11.05 joint ticket • tarragona.cat
The Circ Roma, or Roman Circus, was the site of chariot races. The visible sections encompass vaults that are set back from the street under the gloom of the surrounding buildings. You can exit through the Roman Pretori tower on Pl. del Rei.
Casa Castellarnau
C/Cavallers 14 • Mid-May to Sept Tues–Sat 10am–9pm, Sun 10am–3pm; rest of year Tues–Sat 10am–7pm, Sun 10am–3pm • €3.30 or €11.05 joint ticket • 977 242 220, tarragona.cat
Strolling the old town’s streets will also enable you to track down one of Tarragona’s finest medieval mansions and lesser-known museums, the Casa Castellarnau. The interior courtyard alone rewards a visit, with its arches and stone coats of arms built over Roman vaults. Otherwise, the small-scale collections are largely archeological and historical (Roman jars and the like), rescued from banality by some rich eighteenth-century Catalan furniture and furnishings on the upper floor.
The Catedral
Pl. de Palau 2 • Mid-March to Oct Mon 3–6pm, Tues–Sat 10am–7pm; Nov to mid-March Mon–Sat 10am–5pm • €5; guided visit €15, call ahead to book • 977 226 935, catedraltarragona.com
The central C/Major climbs to the quarter’s focal point, the Catedral, which sits at the top of a broad flight of steps. This, quite apart from its own grand beauty, is a perfect example of the transition from Romanesque to Gothic forms. You’ll see the change highlighted in the main facade, where a soaring Gothic portal is framed by Romanesque doors, surmounted by a cross and an elaborate rose window. Except for services, entrance to the Catedral is through the cloisters (claustre; signposted up a street to the left of the facade), themselves superbly executed with pointed Gothic arches softened by smaller round divisions. The cloister also has several oddly sculpted capitals, one of which represents a cat’s funeral being directed by rats. Note that the Catedral has been undergoing renovations, so parts of it may be closed to the public, and the entry fee may therefore be reduced. The ticket also gives access to the Museu Diocesà, which is piled high with ecclesiastical treasures.
Serrallo
A fifteen-minute walk west along the industrial harbourfront from the train station (or the same distance south from the Necropolis) takes you to the working port of Serrallo, Tarragona’s so-called “fishermen’s quarter”. Built a century ago, the harbour here isn’t particularly attractive, though it’s authentic enough – fishing smacks tied up, nets laid out on the ground for mending. The real interest for visitors is the line of seafood restaurants which fronts the main Moll dels Pescadors. The warehouses nearby, back towards town, have been given a face-lift, as has the Estació Marítima (cruise-ship terminal).

There are plenty of good restaurants in the centre of Tarragona; many – particularly in and around Pl. de la Font – have outdoor seating in the summer. Alternatively, you could try the fish and seafood places down in Serrallo – not cheap, but the food is fresh and you can find some menus for around €15–20 in the narrow street behind the main Moll dels Pescadors. Tarragona’s marina (Port Esportiu) features several clubs and bars, which generally heat up in the summer – though note that they come and go with great regularity. It’s in town – around the old quarter and the Catedral and in the streets between the train station and Rambla Nova – that you’ll find spots with more historical, local appeal.

Around Tarragona
The coast between Tarragona and the historic town of Altafulla, 11km east, is littered with Roman remains, well worth checking out, though for all but the Roman aqueduct you’ll need your own transport. West of Tarragona, the pleasant town of Reus features an entertaining museum on master Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Aqüeducte de les Ferreres
Open during daylight hours • Free • 977 242 220, tarragona.cat • Parking on site; check with turisme about bus transport to the site
Perhaps the most remarkable (and least visited) of Tarragona’s monuments stands 4km outside the original city walls, reached via a small, signposted road off the main Lleida highway. This is the Roman Aqüeducte de les Ferreres, which brought water from the Ríu Gayo, some 32km away. The most impressive extant section, nearly 220m long and 27m high, lies in an overgrown valley in the middle of nowhere: the utilitarian beauty of the aqueduct is surpassed only by the one at Segovia and the Pont du Gard, in the south of France. Popularly, it is known as El Pont del Diable (Devil’s Bridge) because, remarked Richard Ford, of the Spanish habit of “giving all praise to ‘the Devil’, as Pontifex Maximus”.
Reus
Gaudí aficionados might want to take a spin through the small, handsome city of Reus, 14km west of Tarragona, where the modernisme master, Gaudí, was born in 1852. While Reus has no Gaudí buildings – he left at the age of 16 – it does feature a smattering of other modernista structures, all of which form part of the town’s Ruta del Modernisme. Besides Gaudí, Reus is popular for its good shopping, especially clothing, thanks in part to the town’s once-thriving textile industry.
Gaudí Centre
Pl. del Mercadal 3 • Mid-June to mid-Sept Mon–Sat 10am–8pm, Sun & hols 11am–2pm; mid-Sept to mid-June Mon–Sat 10am–2pm & 4–7pm, Sun & hols 11am–2pm • €9, under-14s €5, under-8s free • 977 010 670, gaudicentre.com
The sleek Gaudí Centre offers an engaging overview of the great artist via three floors of tactile and sensory exhibits. The first floor focuses on young Gaudí and his connection with Reus; look for what is believed to be the only handwritten notebook by Gaudí still in existence. The second floor, called “Gaudí the Innovator”, focuses on his progressive designs. The top floor shows a film on Gaudí and covers his influence on architecture around the globe.
WINE TOURING IN THE PRIORAT
Around 35km west of Tarragona lies one of Catalunya’s top wine regions, the Priorat, which was awarded its DOC in 2001. The red wine produced here, and in the adjacent Montsant DOC, is highly sought after, and the cellers have started to follow their more established competitors in La Rioja by cashing in with wine tours and tastings. The turisme in Tarragona has up-to-date information, or you can try the local office in Falset (Mon–Fri 9am–3pm & 4–7pm, Sat 10am–2pm, Sun 11am–2pm; 977 831 023, turismepriorat.org). Most tours cost €5–7, and many have English-speaking guides – reservations are essential.

Altafulla
ALTAFULLA makes a reasonable stop. Take a wander about the old town, where there's a 400-year-old castle (privately owned), the Baroque Església Parroquial de Sant Martí (open for services only), which was completed in 1705 and has a distinctive octagonal dome, and a pair of gateways left standing from the original medieval walls.
Villa Romana dels Munts
C/Villa Romana • June–Sept Tues–Sat 10am–1.30pm & 4–8pm, Sun 10am–2pm; March–May & Oct Tues–Sat 10am–1.30pm & 3–6pm, Sun 10am–2pm; Jan–Feb & Nov–Dec Tues–Sat 10am–1.30pm & 3–5.30pm, Sun 10am–2pm • €2.50 • 977 652 806, mnat.cat
Surrounded by a sleepy estate of holiday homes, the Villa Romana dels Munts is one of the more important finds in the region, primarily because of the exceptional mosaics and paintings that decorated its rooms and thermal baths – indicating an owner of high standing. The mosaics are preserved in the Museu Nacional Arqueològic in Tarragona and today the villa is worth a look chiefly for the ruins of its thermal baths, which include a remarkably well-preserved arch and water tank.
Arrival and information: Altafulla
By bus and train Regular buses and trains connect Altafulla with Tarragona (10min).
Turisme C/Marqués de Tamarit 16 altafulla.cat (Jan–March Mon–Fri 9am–3pm; May, June & Sept–Dec Mon–Thurs 9am–3pm, Fri & Sat 4–7pm; July & Aug daily 10am–2pm & 4–8pm; 977 651 426); Pl. dels Vents (summer only; 977 650 752). Note that hours change depending on city budget.

Tortosa
The only town of any size in Catalunya’s deep south is TORTOSA, slightly inland astride the Ríu Ebre. In the Civil War the front was outside Tortosa for several months until the Nationalists eventually took the town in April 1938. The battle cost 35,000 lives, and is commemorated by a gaunt metal monument on a huge stone plinth in the middle of the river in town. The fighting took its toll in other ways, too: there’s little left of the medieval quarter, the barri antic, which lies on the east bank of the Ebro, north of the modern commercial district. Nonetheless, Tortosa still throws a boisterous and popular Festa del Renaixement (Renaissance Festival; festadelrenaixement.org) in late July, which celebrates the city’s history, with thousands turning out in period costumes, along with theatre, street entertainment, live music, free-flowing wine and more.
Catedral de Santa Maria
C/Portal del Palau • Tues–Sat 10am–1pm & 4.30–7pm, Sun usually 12.30–2pm
The Catedral de Santa Maria is worth a look. Founded originally in the twelfth century on the site of an earlier mosque, it was rebuilt in the fourteenth century, and its Gothic interior and quiet cloister – although much worn – are both lovely.

THE WINE CATHEDRAL
The name says it all: The Bodega Pagos de Híbera Catedral del Vi (Wine Cathedral; C/Pilonet, 977 426 234, catedraldelvi.com; €5.50; Mon–Fri & Sun 10am–2.30pm & 3.30–7pm, Sat 10am–8pm) rises over Pinell de Brai, roughly 30km north of Tortosa, in the Terra Alta region, which is Catalunya’s southernmost wine region. Designed by Gaudí disciple Cèsar Martinell, the winery is a magnificent tribute to modernisme, revealing its architectural hallmarks, from soaring stone arches to colourful tiling. The winery offers self-guided audio tours and wine and olive-oil tastings, as well as free guided visits at noon and 5pm on the weekends. Make a day of it, and sample local cuisine – and Pagos de Híbera wine – at the stately restaurant (open Sat & Sun for lunch only), which serves an excellent menu (€26). Dishes include grilled octopus and traditional Catalan sausage, followed by choice desserts – try the luscious crema Catalana. Northwest of Pinell de Brai lies the town of Gandesa, the capital of the Terra Alta wine region, and home to the Celler Cooperatiu de Gandesa (Avda. Catalunya 28, 977 420 017, coopgandesa.com; Mon–Sat 9am–1pm & 3–7pm, Sun 9am–2pm), another magnificent building also designed by Martinell.
La Suda and the Jardins del Príncep
Jardins del Príncep • May to mid-Sept Tues–Sat 10am–1.30pm & 4.30–7.30pm, Sun 11am–1.30pm; mid-Sept to April 10am–1.30pm & 3.30–6.30pm, Sun 11am–1.30pm • €3 • tortosaturisme.cat
Tortosa’s brightest point is also its highest. La Suda, the old castle, sits perched above the Catedral, glowering from behind its battlements at the Ebre valley below and the mountains beyond. Like so many in Spain, the castle has been converted into a luxury parador, but there’s nothing to stop you climbing up for a magnificent view from the walls, or from going into the plush bar and having a drink.
The Jardins del Príncep, which sit at the base of the castle, feature an impressive collection of sculptures of the human figure by Santiago de Santiago.
Arrival and information: Tortosa
By train Tortosa is connected by regular trains to Barcelona (2hr) and Tarragona (1hr).
By bus Buses run from Tortosa to Vinaròs (in Castellón province to the south), from where you can reach the wonderful inland mountain town of Morella; and to Tarragona and the Delta de l’Ebre area.
Turisme Jardins del Príncep (May to mid-Sept Tues–Sat 10am–1.30pm & 4.30–7.30pm, Sun 11am–1.30pm; mid-Sept to April 10am–1.30pm & 3.30–6.30pm, Sun 11am–1.30pm; 977 442 005, tortosaturisme.cat).

The Delta de l’Ebre
In the bottom corner of Catalunya is the Delta de l’Ebre (Ebro Delta), 320 square kilometres of sandy delta constituting the biggest wetland in Catalunya and one of the most important aquatic habitats in the western Mediterranean. Designated a natural park, its brackish lagoons, marshes, dunes and reed beds are home to thousands of wintering birds and provide excellent fishing; around fifteen percent of the total Catalan catch comes from this area. The scenery is unique in Catalunya, with low roads running through field after field of rice paddies, punctuated by solitary houses and small villages, before emerging onto dune-lined beaches. Since much of the area of the Parc Natural de Delta de l’Ebre is a protected zone, access is limited, and it’s best to visit with your own transport. Check in with the well-stocked tourist office about birdwatching opportunities and other nature tours and treks.
Deltebre
The best place to start to get a good sense of Delta de l’Ebre is the town of DELTEBRE, at the centre of the delta, 30km from Tortosa. There’s also an interesting Ecomuseum, in the park information centre (Mon–Sat 10am–2pm & 3–7pm, Sun 10am–2pm, until 6pm in winter, Sun 10am–2pm; €1.20), which has an aquarium displaying species found in the delta.
Riumar
The town of RIUMAR, 10km east of Deltebre, also makes for a good base to explore the area. It has a couple of restaurants and good, if windy, bathing on a sandy beach, connected to the road by duckboards winding through the dunes, and more remote beaches accessible to the north.
information and tours: Delta de l’Ebre
Park information centre Martí Buera 22, on the main highway, on the edge of Deltebre (Mon–Sat 10am–2pm & 3–7pm, Sun 10am–2pm, until 6pm in winter; 977 489 679, deltebre.net). The well-signposted information centre can provide you with a map of the delta and has information about tours and local walks.
River cruises A river cruise is a good way to experience the delta. Several boat companies, including Creuers Delta de l’Ebre (977 480 128,  creuersdeltaebre.com), the Santa Sussanna (629 204 117) and Olmos (977 480 548) operate trips of an hour or so on the river. Enquire at the tourist office or call ahead, because the boats sometimes only operate for groups; prices start at around €9/trip.
accommodation and eating
Casa Núri Final Goles de Ebre, Riumar 977 480 128, restaurantnuri.com.

Montblanc
The walled medieval town of MONTBLANC, 8km before the turning to the monastery at Poblet, is a surprisingly beautiful place to discover in the middle of nowhere. The Pl. Major is picturesque, and livens up for the evening passeig, while there are many fine little Romanesque and Gothic monuments contained within the town’s tight circle of old streets; all are marked on the map in front of the town’s medieval gateway, the Torre-portal de Bové, which is just 100m or so up from the train station. On the southern side of the walls, the Torre-portal de Sant Jordi marks the spot where San Jordi, or St George (patron saint of Catalunya as well as England), slew the dragon, an event commemorated with a fiesta on April 23.
Santa Maria la Major
Pl. Major • Mon–Sat 11am–1pm & 4–6pm, Sun 11am–2pm • Free • 977 860 110
Just above the central Pl. Major, stands the grand Gothic parish church of Santa Maria la Major; its elaborate facade has lions’ faces on either side of the main doorway and cherubs swarming up the pillars.

Sant Miquel
Pl. St Miquel • Open only as part of a guided tour • Free
East from Santa Maria along C/Major is the church of Sant Miquel, which dates from the fourteenth century, and has Romanesque and Gothic elements, an impressive coffered ceiling and lovely Gothic lateral chapels. The church was the seat of the Catalan courts from 1307 to 1370.

Santa Coloma de Queralt
This well-preserved pocket of history, hidden amid the plains of the comarca of Conca de Barbarà, lies 29km north of Montblanc. SANTA COLOMA DE QUERALT is a town made for meandering – and soaking up the medieval past. The best way to explore is via guided tours run by the tourist office, which include a variety of sights: the lovely porticoed squares, the Pl. de l’Església and Pl. Major; the fourteenth-century Ermita de Santa Maria de Bell-lloc, home to a 1370 alabaster sepulchre of the Counts of Queralt; and the Cal Jaume Punto, a perfectly preserved general store from 1848.

Eating
Hostal Colomí C/Raval de Jesús 12, 977 880 653. Catalunya is justly famous for its wildly progressive cuisine, exemplified by the Roca Brothers in Girona. But, this culinary stardom is rooted in the region’s traditional dishes, many of which reveal Catalunya’s natural bounty. For a taste, turn to les germanes Camps – the Camps sisters – who helm Hostal Colomí, founded in 1948. For many, this isn’t just the best traditional Catalan cuisine in the Tarragona region – it’s the best in the country. The meal starts with two large porrons (pitchers) of wine – one white, one red – and a platter of pa amb tomàquet (bread smeared in tomato and drizzled in olive oil). The feast continues, including warm ham croquettes, cod and platters of grilled meat and asparagus from the open-air grill, culminating in dessert – crema Catalana, of course. Best of all: the set lunch menu is an excellent deal, at €15. Tues–Sun 1–4pm.
The Monestir de Poblet
Mid-March to mid-Oct Mon–Sat 10am–12.30pm & 3–5.55pm, Sun 10.30am–12.25pm & 3–5.25pm; mid-Oct to mid-March Mon–Sat 10am–12.30pm & 3–5.25pm, Sun 10.30am–12.25pm & 3–5.25pm • €7.50; €10 with guided tour • 977 870 254, poblet.cat
There are few ruins more stirring than the Monestir de Poblet, lying in glorious open country, vast and sprawling within massive battlemented walls and towered gateways. Once the great monastery of Catalunya, it was in effect a complete manorial village and enjoyed scarcely credible rights, powers and wealth. Founded in 1151 by Ramón Berenguer IV, who united the kingdoms of Catalunya and Aragón, it was planned from the beginning on an immensely grand scale. The kings of Aragón-Catalunya chose to be buried in its chapel and for three centuries diverted huge sums for its endowment, a munificence that was inevitably corrupting. By the late Middle Ages Poblet had become a byword for decadence – there are lewder stories about this than any other Cistercian monastery – and so it continued, hated by the local peasantry, until the Carlist revolution of 1835 when a mob burned and tore it apart. Italian Cistercians repopulated the monastery in 1940 and over the decades since then it’s been subject to continual – and superb – maintenance and restoration.
The cloisters
As so often, the cloisters, focus of monastic life, are the most evocative and beautiful part. Late Romanesque, and sporting a pavilion and fountain, they open onto a series of rooms: a splendid Gothic chapterhouse (with the former abbots’ tombs set in the floor), wine cellars, a parlour, a kitchen equipped with ranges and copper pots, and a sombre, wood-panelled refectory.
The chapel
Beyond, you enter the chapel in which the twelfth- and thirteenth-century tombs of the kings of Aragón have been meticulously restored by Frederico Marès, the manic collector of Barcelona. They lie in marble sarcophagi on either side of the nave, focusing attention on the central sixteenth-century altarpiece.
The dormitory
You’ll also be shown the vast old dormitory, to which there’s direct access from the chapel choir, a poignant reminder of Cistercian discipline. From the dormitory (half of which is sealed off since it’s still in use), a door leads out onto the cloister roof for views down into the cloister itself and up the chapel towers.
Arrival and INFORMATION: Monestir de Poblet
By bus Two to three buses a day (Mon–Sat) run to Poblet from Tarragona or Lleida, passing right by the monastery. It’s an easy day-trip from either city.
By train By train, you get off at the ruined station of L’Espluga de Francolí, from where it’s a beautiful 3km walk to the monastery, much of it along a signposted country track. Since it lies on the same line, it’s easy enough to combine a trip to Poblet with a stop-off at Montblanc.
Turisme Pg. Abat Conill 9, Poblet (summer Tues–Sat 10am–1.30pm & 3–6pm, Sun 10am–2pm; winter Tues–Fri 10am–2pm & 2.30–5pm, Sat 10am–1.30pm & 3–6.30pm, Sun 10am–2pm; 977 871 247).
accommodation and eating
Staying overnight at Poblet is an attractive proposition if you have your own transport, since it makes a good base for an excursion into the surrounding countryside. A kilometre up the road from Poblet, around the walls, the hamlet of Les Masies has a couple of hotels and restaurants, while L’Espluga, 2km northwest, also has a few places to stay.
Hostatgeria de Poblet 977 871 201, hostatgeriadepoblet.cat. For the full monastic experience, stay at the lovely Hostatgeria de Poblet, which rises up alongside the monastery. Designed by Spanish architect Mariano Bayón, the building blends harmoniously with its surroundings, featuring honey-hued stone, a cloister and a courtyard planted with olive trees. The monastic philosophy extends to all parts of the property, which is quiet and soothing, with no TVs in the simply furnished rooms. Guests are invited to participate in the monastery’s liturgy and services. The restaurant serves seasonal dishes, some inspired by historical monastic menus. Dishes €15–25. Breakfast included. Daily 1–4pm & 8–11pm. €90

Prades
If you have time and transport, a couple of excursions into the countryside surrounding Poblet are well worth making. The red-stone walled village of PRADES, in the Serra de Prades, 20km from the monastery, is a beautifully sited and tranquil place that needs no other excuse for a visit. It’s also the place to be during the second weekend of July, when they replace the water in the fountain with cava, and you can join in and help yourself – or order a bottle of bubbly at a terrace bar in the porticoed plaça and enjoy the scene. The area around Poblet is also home to two more twelfth-century Cistercian monasteries.
Reial Monestir de Santes Creus
June–Sept Tues–Sat 10am–6.30pm, Oct–May 10am–5pm • €4.50 • larutadelcister.info
The Reial Monestir de Santes Creus lies 7km north of the Barcelona–Lleida highway, and is clearly signposted. It’s built in Transitional style, with a grand Gothic cloister and some Romanesque traces, and you can explore the dormitory, chapterhouse and main church.
Monestir de Vallbona de les Monges
March–Oct Tues–Sat 10.30am–1.30pm & 4.30–6.30pm, Sun noon–1.30pm & 4.30–6.30pm; Nov–Feb closes 5.30pm • €4 • larutadelcister.info
The Monestir de Vallbona de les Monges is about 16km north of Poblet, and reached via Montblanc. This monastery of monges (nuns) has been occupied continuously for over 800 years. The church, built over the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, is a particularly noteworthy example of the transition between Romanesque and Gothic, and has a rectangular nave and elegant cloisters.



Lleida
LLEIDA (Lérida), at the heart of a fertile plain in inland Catalunya, has a rich history. First a municipium under the Roman Empire and later the centre of a small Arab kingdom, it was reconquered by the Catalans and became the seat of a bishopric in 1149. Little of those periods survives in today’s city but there is one building of outstanding interest, the splendid Catedral, which is sufficient justification in itself to visit. Several interesting museums and a steep set of old-town streets will easily occupy any remaining time. Rooms are easy to come by, and the students at the local university fill the streets and bars on weekend evenings, including at the breezy Pl. de Sant Joan, in good-natured throngs.
Seu Vella and Castillo del Rey
Catedral Summer Tues–Sat 10am–7.30pm, Sun 10am–3pm; winter Tues–Fri 10am–1.30pm & 3–5.30pm, Sat 10am–5.30pm, Sun 10am–3pm; last entry 30min before closing • turoseuvella.cat • Castillo del Rey Summer Tues–Sat 10.30am–2pm & 4–7.30pm, Sun 10am–3pm; winter Tues–Sat 10am–1.30pm & 3–5.30pm, Sun 10am–3pm; last entry 30min before closing • €7 for Catedral and castle
The Seu Vella, or old Catedral, is enclosed within the walls of the ruined Castillo del Rey (also called La Suda), high above the Ríu Segre, a twenty-minute climb from the centre of town. It’s a peculiar fortified building, which in 1707 was deconsecrated and taken over by the military, remaining in their hands until 1940. Enormous damage was inflicted over the years but the church remains a notable example of the Transitional style, similar in many respects to the Catedral of Tarragona. The Gothic cloisters – among the largest cloisters in the world – are masterly, each walk comprising arches different in size and shape but sharing delicate stone tracery. They served the military as a canteen and kitchen. You can also visit parts of the reconstructed castle, such as the fortified walls – the views from the walls over the plain are stupendous. Note: From the old town, there is an elevator that you can enter at Pl. de Sant Joan, which will whisk you to the Seu Vella complex.
Seu Nova
Mon–Fri 9.30am–1pm & 5.30–7.30pm, Sat & Sun 9.30am–1pm & 5.30–8.30pm • Free
You can climb back down from the old Catedral towards the river by way of the new Catedral, La Seu Nova. It’s an austere eighteenth-century building with Neoclassical doorways, a main facade topped by a large crest of the Casa de Borbón and a series of minuscule, high stained-glass windows.
Museu de Lleida
C/Sant Crist 1 • June–Sept Tues–Thurs & Sat 10am–2pm & 4–7pm, Fri & Sun 10am–2pm; Oct–May Tues–Thurs & Sat 10am–2pm & 4–6pm, Fri & Sun 10am–2pm • €5 • 973 28 30 75, museudelleida.cat
The spacious Museu de Lleida is the city’s flagship museum. Two floors show off ancient finds from throughout Lleida and Catalunya, including Romanesque altarpieces, a Visigoth baptismal font and stone sculptures from the Seu Vella.
Centre d’Art La Panera
Pl. de la Panera 2 • Tues–Fri 10am–2pm & 4–7pm, Sat 11am–2pm & 5–8pm, Sun 11am–2pm • Free • 973 262 185, lapanera.cat
For top-notch exhibits of contemporary art, check out the creative Centre d’Art La Panera. The building’s history is as interesting as the art inside: it dates back to the twelfth century, when it was Lleida’s trading exchange and market, and you can still see evidence of its medieval roots in the original colonnade, made up of a line of 21 stone columns. In the early 1600s, the building was acquired by the canonry of the Catedral, who used it to store and sell food products – hence its official name, La Panera dels Canonges, or The Canons’ Pantry.
THE SNAIL TRAIL IN LLEDIA
You don’t need to visit France for the finest escargot. Lleida’s snails – caragols – rival their neighbours to the north. This small capital of inland Catalunya is one of Spain’s most famous snail cities. With snails, simpler is better: the most delicious preparation is caragols a la llauna – grilled, and seasoned with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic. On the side? A generous dollop of allioli. This being Spain, there is of course a dedicated festival – the Aplec del Caragol in late May is one of the largest snail festivals in the country, with more than twelve tons (yes, tons) of snails served. But, you don’t need to wait until then to feast on snails: Lleida is filled with restaurants that serve the delicacy.

Sitges
The lovely seaside town of Sitges, 36km south of Barcelona, is the highlight of the local coast. The great weekend escape for young Barcelonans, who have created a resort very much in their own image, it’s also a noted gay holiday destination, with an outrageous carnival and an ebullient nightlife to match – between June and September it seems like there’s a nonstop party going on. But Sitges is far more than just cocktails under the sun. It also has a beautifully preserved old town, along with a variety of well-curated art and history museums. Out of season, especially, Sitges is delightful: far less crowded, and with a temperate climate that encourages strolling along the promenade and exploring the narrow central lanes. Note that on Monday, many of the museums and restaurants are closed.

The old town
Old Sitges centres on a tangle of alleyways that climb up and over the knoll, topped by the landmark Baroque Església Parroquial (parish church) dedicated to Sant Bartolomeu, which divides the seafront in two. Sweeping views stretch beyond the beaches to either side and along the coast, while a cluster of late medieval whitewashed mansions holds assorted museums and galleries.
Scores of handsome, more recent townhouses were built in Sitges in the nineteenth century by successful local merchants (known as “Americanos”) who returned from Cuba and Puerto Rico. A walk along the seafront promenade reveals the best of them, adorned with wrought-iron balconies, stained-glass windows and ceramic decoration. The pedestrianized shopping street, Carrer Major, is the best place for browsing boutiques.
Museu Cau Ferrat
C/Fonollar • Tues–Sun: April–June & Oct 10am–7pm; July–Sept 10am–8pm; Nov–March 10am–5pm • €10, includes Museu Maricel • 938 940 364, museusdesitges.cat
The gorgeous renovated mansion that overlooks the sea and contains the Museu Cau Ferrat served from 1891 onwards as the home and workshop of artist and writer Santiago Rusiñol i Prats (1861–1931). Rusiñol organized five modernista festivals in Sitges between 1892 and 1899, and the town flourished as a major modernista centre under his patronage. Magnificently tiled rooms display an extraordinary array of paintings, artefacts and decorative ironwork gathered by Rusiñol, including works by Rusiñol himself and contemporaries such as Picasso, and even a couple of minor El Grecos that he bought when the painter’s reputation was much less elevated than it is today.
Museu Maricel
C/Davallada 12, adjoining Museu Cau Ferrat • Tues–Sun: April–June & Oct 10am–7pm; July–Sept 10am–8pm; Nov–March 10am–5pm • €10, includes Museum Cau Ferrat • 938 940 364, museusdesitges.cat
Browse the timeline of Catalan art from the tenth century on, including richly detailed medieval art and the 19th Luminist School of Sitges, a group of landscape artists who were inspired by the town’s beautiful seaside light and open skies.
Fundació Stämpfli
Pl. de l’Ajuntament 13 • March–June & Oct Fri 5–7pm, Sat–Sun 11am–2pm & 5–7pm; July–Sept Wed–Thurs & Fri 5–8pm, Sat–Sun 11am–2pm & 5–8pm; Nov–Feb Fri 4–7pm, Sat–Sun 11am–2pm • €5 • 938 940 364, fundacio-stampfli.org
Housed in Sitges’ former fish market and a similarly venerable adjoining building, the Fundació Stämpfli is home to the wide-ranging contemporary art collection of Swiss-born artist Peter Stämpfli and his wife, Anna Maria, who have been active members of the local art scene since the 1970s. The works – some eighty paintings, sculptures and more by international artists such as Erró, Gérard Fromanger and Stämpfli himself – offer a sweeping view of various art movements from the past fifty years. The renovated space in which the collection is presented is simple but beautiful, with a vaulted, wood-beamed ceiling and gleaming floors.
The beaches
The clean sand beaches, located to both east and west of the old-town headland, become extremely crowded in high season. For more space it’s best to keep walking west along the promenade, past a series of eight interlinked beaches that runs a couple of kilometres down the coast as far as the Hotel Terramar. There are breakwaters, beach bars, restaurants, showers and watersports facilities along the way, with the more notorious gay nudist beaches found at the far end.
CARNIVAL TIME
Carnival in Sitges (Carnestoltes in Catalan; Feb/March) is a spectacular affair, thanks largely to the strong gay presence. It opens on the so-called Fat Thursday with the arrival of the Carnival King, following which there’s a full programme of parades, masked balls, concerts, beach parties and sausage sizzles. The traditional xatónada gala dinners are named after the carnival dish, xató, a kind of salt-cod salad, which originates in Sitges. There’s a children’s procession on Sunday, while Carnival climaxes in Sunday night’s Debauchery Parade and the even bigger Tuesday-night Extermination Parade, featuring exquisitely dressed drag queens swanning about the streets in high heels. Bar doors stand wide open, bands play and processions and celebrations go on until dawn. Ash Wednesday itself sees the more traditional Burial of the Sardine.
ARRIVAL AND INFORMATION: SITGES
By train Trains to Sitges leave Pg. de Gràcia or Barcelona Sants stations roughly every 30min (destination Vilanova or St Vicenç), and take 30–40min depending on the service. The last departure back to Barcelona is at around 10.30pm (starting again at around 5am).
By bus Mon-Bus (monbus.cat) runs a direct service to Sitges from Barcelona airport (Mon–Fri once or twice an hour 7.40am–11.40pm, Sat & Sun every 2–3hr), which takes around 35min and stops two blocks from the train station; the buses actually start from Ronda Universitat in Barcelona itself around 20min earlier. There are also hourly nightbuses year-round between Pg. de Vilafranca in Sitges and Pl. Catalunya and Pl. Espanya in Barcelona. For both day and night buses, you can by tickets on the bus (from €4 one-way).
Oficina de Turisme Pl. Eduard Maristany 2, next to the train station (Mon–Fri 10am–2pm & 4–6.30pm, Sat 10am–2pm & 4–7pm, Sun 10am–2pm; 938 944 251, sitgestur.cat).
EATING
Sitges has a huge array of restaurants, and the quality is largely very good, thanks to a discerning, upmarket tourist crowd and well-heeled locals. Every restaurant along the front does a paella with a promenade view, though some of the more interesting places are hidden away in the backstreets. For picnic supplies visit the Mercat Municipal (Mon, Wed & Sat 8.30am–2pm, Tues, Thurs & Fri 8.30am–2pm & 5.30–8.30pm), close to the train station on Av. Artur Carbonell, which is good for cured meats, olives, cheese, fresh bread and fruit.

El Cable C/Barcelona 1 938 948 761, elcable.cat. With its lively social scene, Sitges is a tapas town – and the long-running, amiable El Cable is one of the best. Feast on patatas bravas, ham croquettes and spicy sausage. Tapas €2–8. Daily noon–3.30pm & 7–11.30pm.
★La Nansa C/Carreta 35 938 941 927, restaurantlanansa.com.

Sant Cugat and Terrassa
A series of remarkable churches lies on the commuter train line northwest of Barcelona, the first in the town of Sant Cugat del Vallès – just 25 minutes from the city – and the second (actually a group of three) another fifteen minutes beyond in the industrial city of Terrassa. You can easily see all the churches in a morning, but throw in lunch and this just about stretches to a day-trip, and it’s not a bad ride in any case – after Sarrià, the train emerges from the city tunnels and chugs down the wooded valley into Sant Cugat.
Sant Cugat del Vallès
Reial Monestir Mon–Sat 8am–noon & 4–9pm, Sun open for Mass from 9am • Free Museu del Monestir May–Sept Tues–Sat 10.30am–1.30pm & 5–8pm, Sun & hols 10.30am–2.30pm; Oct–April Tues–Sat 10.30am–1.30pm & 4–7pm, Sun & hols 10.30am–2.30pm • Free Museu del Tapís Contemporani May–Sept Tues–Fri 5–8pm, Sat 10.30am–1.30pm & 5–8pm, Sun & hols 10.30am–2.30pm; Oct–April Tues–Fri 4–7pm, Sat 10.30am–1.30pm & 4–7pm, Sun & hols 10.30am–2.30pm • Free • 936 759 951, www.museu.santcugat.cat
The Benedictine Reial Monestir (Royal Monastery) at Sant Cugat del Vallès was founded as far back as the ninth century, though most of the surviving buildings date from three or four hundred years later. Its fawn stone facade and triple-decker bell tower make a lovely sight as you approach from the square outside, through the gate, past the renovated Bishop’s Palace and under a splendid rose window. Finest of all, though, is the beautiful twelfth-century Romanesque cloister, with noteworthy capital carvings of mythical beasts and biblical scenes. Their unusual homogeneity owes to the fact that all were completed by a single sculptor, Arnau Gatell.
The monastery complex encompasses the Museu de Sant Cugat, which includes the restored dormitory, kitchen and refectory of the monastery, and holds exhibitions about its history and monastic life. What were once the monastery’s kitchen gardens lie across from the Bishop’s Palace, though the formerly lush plots that sustained the brothers are now mere dusty gardens, albeit with views over the low walls to Tibidabo and the Collserola hills. The Museu del Tapís Contemporani (Contemporary Tapestry Museum) also forms part of the museum grounds. Set in the 1926 Casa Aymat, once the workshop and factory of textile artist Tomàs Aymat, the museum explores the formidable textile history of Catalunya.

ARRIVAL AND INFORMATION: SANT CUGAT DEL VALLÈS
By train FGC trains on the S1 line connect Pl. de Catalunya in Barcelona with Sant Cugat, which is in Zone 2, every 10–15min (fgc.cat). Once in Sant Cugat, walk straight ahead out of the train station and down the pedestrianized C/Valldoreix, taking the first right and then the first left (it’s still C/Valldoreix), and then keep straight along the shopping street (C/Santa María and then C/Santiago Rusiñol) until you see the monastery bell tower (10min walk).
Oficina de Turisme Sant Cugat del Vallès, Pl. Octavia 10, inside the main doorway of the monastery (June–Sept Tues–Fri 10.30am–1.30pm & 5.30–7pm, Sat 10am–2pm & 5–8pm, Sun & hols 10am–2pm; Oct–May Tues–Fri 10.30am–1.15pm & 4.15–5.45pm, Sat 10am–2pm & 4–6pm, Sun & hols 10am–2pm; 936 759 952, turisme.santcugat.cat).
Terrassa
Terrassa, a large city with a population of 200,000 located 25km northwest of Barcelona, was an important textile producer in the nineteenth century, and retains many fine modernista-style factories, mills and warehouses that now enjoy protected status. But Terrassa has a much longer history, and its true treasures stand on the edge of the city centre, built on the site of the Roman town of Ègara – three pre-Romanesque churches, dating from the fifth to the tenth centuries.
La Seu d’Ègara
La Seu d’Ègara, Pl. del Rector Horns 1 • Tues–Sat 10am–1.30pm & 4–7pm, Sun & hols 11am–2pm • €7, under-6s free • 937 833 702, seudegara.cat
Known as La Seu d’Ègara, Terrassa’s fully restored ecclesiastical complex centres on its largest church, Sant Pere, which sports a badly faded Gothic mural and a tenth-century mosaic fragment within its walls. The church of Santa María is far better endowed, featuring a mosaic pavement outside and sunken baptismal font inside, both of which date from the fifth century. Much later Gothic (fourteenth- and fifteenth-century) murals and altarpieces – one by Catalan master Jaume Huguet – are also on display. But it’s the fifth-century baptistry of Sant Miquel that’s the most fascinating – a tiny, square building of rough masonry, steeped in gloom, with eight assorted columns supporting the dome, each with a carved Roman or Visigothic capital. Underneath sits the partially reconstructed baptismal bath, while steps lead down into a simple crypt.
ARRIVAL AND INFORMATION: TERRASSA
By train FGC trains from Barcelona (S1 line from Pl. de Catalunya; fgc.cat) depart every 20–30min – get off at Terrassa-Rambla, the last stop, which is in Zone 3. The churches are a 20min walk from the station – turn right from the Rambla d’Ègara exit, then immediately right again into Pl. de Clavé, follow C/Major up to Pl. Vella, cross the square, turn up C/Gavatxons and follow C/Sant Pere, C/Nou de Sant Pere and C/Creu Gran, finally crossing a viaduct to arrive at the entrance. There is a more convenient Renfe mainline train station in Terrassa (direct trains from Barcelona Sants every 20min; renfe.com) – a straight 10min walk down C/Mas Adel to the churches – but only the FGC line connects both Sant Cugat and Terrassa.
Oficina de Turisme Masia Freixa, Plaça Freixa i Argemí 11 (Tues–Fri 9am–2pm & 5–7pm, Sat–Sun 10am–2pm; Aug open mornings only; 937 397 019, visitaterrassa.cat). Organizes guided tours throughout the city, including many of its historic buildings.
Colònia Güell
Before work at Barcelona’s Park Güell got under way, Antoni Gaudí had already been charged with the design of parts of Eusebi Güell’s earliest attempts to establish a Utopian industrial estate, or colònia (colony), on the western outskirts of the city. The Colònia Güell (gaudicoloniaguell.org) at Santa Coloma de Cervelló was very much of its time – more than seventy similar colonies were established along Catalan rivers in the late nineteenth century, using water power to drive the textile mills. The concept was also familiar in Britain, where enlightened Victorian entrepreneurs had long created idealistic towns (Saltaire, Bournville) to house their workers.
The Colònia Güell was begun in 1890, and by 1920 incorporated over one hundred houses and public buildings, plus the chapel and crypt for which Gaudí was responsible. The Güell company was taken over in 1945 and the whole complex closed as a going concern in 1973, though the buildings have since been restored – and, indeed, many are still lived in today. There are rows of terraced houses, with front gardens tended lovingly by the current inhabitants, while brick towers, ceramic panels and stained glass elevate many of the houses above the ordinary. It’s a working village, so you’ll also find a bank and pharmacy, as well as two or three cafés and restaurants, and on Saturdays there is a farmers’ market, with fresh fruit and vegetables from the Baix Llobregat area.
Gaudí’s church
May–Oct Mon–Fri 10am–7pm, Sat & Sun 10am–3pm; Nov–April Mon–Fri 10am–5pm, Sat & Sun 10am–3pm; generallly closed for visits during Mass on Sun (11am & 1pm) • €7 • gaudicoloniaguell.org
Gaudí’s church – built into the pine-clad hillside above the colony – is a masterpiece. While you can see the angular exterior from the outside for free, to see the far more dramatic interior you’ll first have to buy a ticket at the visitor centre. The crypt was designed to carry the weight of the chapel above, its palm-tree-like columns supporting a brick vault, and the whole lot resembling a labyrinth of caves fashioned from a variety of different stone and brick. Several of Gaudí’s more extraordinary flights of fancy – like the original scalloped pews, the conch shells used as water stoups, the vivid stained glass and the window that opens up like the wings of a butterfly – presage his later work on the Sagrada Família. Despite appearances, the church was never actually finished, and Gaudí stopped work on it in 1914. Ongoing restoration aims to complete the outer walls, though Gaudí’s planned 40m-high central dome is unlikely ever to be realized.
ARRIVAL AND INFORMATION: COLÒNIA GÜELL
By train Take the FGC train S4, S8 or S33 (direction Martorell; departures every 15–20min; fgc.cat) from Pl. d’Espanya to the small Colònia Güell station; the ride takes 20min. From the station, follow the painted blue footprints across the highway and into the colònia; they lead directly to the visitor centre (10min).
Centre d’Acollida de Visitants (May–Oct Mon–Fri 10am–7pm, Sat & Sun 10am–3pm; Nov–April Mon–Fri 10am–5pm, Sat & Sun 10am–3pm; 936 305 807, gaudicoloniaguell.org). The visitor centre has an exhibition (with English notes).
Guided tours Tours of the church, or of both the church and the rest of Colònia Güell, are available daily throughout the year; admission with one tour €9.50, with both €11.50. An audio-guide (€9, including admission) is also offered.
EATING AND DRINKING
Ateneu Unió Pl. Joan Güell 5 936 613 111. The big, old-fashioned, if a bit faded, bar-restaurant on the quiet central square is good for sandwiches, tapas and a decent menú del dia (from €12) served on the sunny terrassa. Daily 6am–11pm.
L’Alt Penedès wine region
L’Alt Penedès wine region (enoturismepenedes.cat), roughly halfway between Barcelona and Tarragona, is the largest Catalan producer of still and sparkling wines – as becomes increasingly clear the further the train heads into the region, with vines as far as the eye can see on both sides of the track. Both the two main towns to visit can easily be seen in a single day: Sant Sadurní d’Anoia, closer to Barcelona, is the self-styled “Capital del Cava”, home to fifty-plus producers of sparkling wine, while Vilafranca del Penedès, ten minutes down the line, is the region’s administrative capital and produces mostly still wine, red and white.
If you’re serious about visiting vineyards, the trip is better done by car, as many of the more interesting boutique producers lie out in the countryside. Either of the towns’ tourist offices can provide a good map pinpointing all the local vineyards as well as the rural farmhouse restaurants. However, even by train you’ll be able to visit a winery or two, including one of the most famous of Catalan wine names.
Sant Sadurní d’Anoia
The small town of Sant Sadurní d’Anoia (population 12,000), built on land watered by the Riu Noya, has been an important centre of wine production since the eighteenth century. When, at the end of the nineteenth century, French vineyards suffered heavily from phylloxera, Sant Sadurní prospered, though later it too succumbed to the same wasting disease – something remembered still in the annual September festival by the parade of a representation of the feared phylloxera parasite. The production of cava, for which the town is now famous, began only in the 1870s – an industry that went hand in hand with the Catalan cork business, established in the forests of the hinterland. Today, a hundred million bottles a year of cava are turned out by dozens of companies, many of which are only too happy to escort you around their premises, show you the fermentation process and let you taste a glass or two.
CAVA
Cava is a naturally sparkling wine made using the méthode champenoise, the traditional method for making champagne. The basic grape varieties of L’Alt Penedès are macabeu, xarel.lo and parellada, which are fermented to produce a wine base and then mixed with sugar and yeast before being bottled: a process known as tiratge. The bottles are then sealed hermetically – the tapat – and laid flat in cellars – the criança – for up to nine months to ferment for a second time. The wine is later decanted to get rid of the sediment before being corked.
The cava is then classified according to the amount of sugar used in the fermentation: either Brut (less than 20g a litre), Sec (20–30g), Semisec (30–50g) or Dolç (more than 50g). This is the first thing to take note of before buying or drinking: Brut and Sec are to most people’s tastes and are excellent with almost any food, or as an aperitif; Semisec and Dolç are better consumed as dessert wines.
Freixenet
Daily tours and tastings, lasting 1hr 30min; usually Mon–Sat 9.30am–4.30pm, Sun 10am–1pm; check website for variations; reservations suggested • €12, under-18s €8.50, under-8s free • 938 917 000, freixenet.es
Most people never get any further than the most prominent and most famous company, Freixenet – producer of those distinctive black bottles – whose building is right outside the train station. Many other companies have similar arrangements, including the out-of-town Codorníu – the region’s earliest cava producer – which has a fine building by modernista architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch as an added attraction.
Codorniu
Daily tours; check website to confirm times; English tours generally 3 times daily during the week, and 2 times daily at weekends; reservations suggested • €12 (€19 Anna tour, €22 Puig i Cadafalch tour), under-18s €8 (€14 Anna tour, €18 Puig i Cadafalch tour), under-7s free • 938 913 342, codorniu.com
Codorniu offers an array of tours, including the traditional tour, the new Anna tour, which focuses on light and fresh Anna de Codorniu tastings; and a Puig i Cadafalch tour, which includes an in-depth exploration of the art and architecture of the winery. There are several dozen other caves or cellars in and around town, all shown on a map available at the Sant Sadurní tourist office.
Jean Leon
In Torrelavit, 7km west of Sant Sadurní d’Anoia • Mon–Fri 9am–6pm, Sat, Sun & hols 9am–2pm • Tours from €15, reservations required • 938 995 512, jeanleon.com
This boutique winery is as colourful as its founder – Jean Leon. Born Ceferino Carrión in Santander, Jean Leon ambitiously struck out for New York and then Hollywood, where, with James Dean, he opened the famous La Scala restaurant in Beverly Hills. But Leon’s love of Spain – and wine – brought him back to the Penedès region, where he launched the eponymous winery in the early 1960s. Today, it’s owned and managed by Torres, and features an American-modernist-inspired visitor centre set in particularly bucolic surroundings. Lively themed tours include tastings of Jean Leon’s signature single-vineyard wines, many named after key phases in Leon’s life, as well as superb local cuisine.
Vilafranca del Penedès
As a town, Vilafranca del Penedès is rather more interesting than Sant Sadurní. Founded in the eleventh century in a bid to attract settlers to land retaken from the expelled Moors, it became a prosperous market centre. That character remains evident today, in a compact old town at whose heart lie narrow streets and arcaded squares adorned with restored medieval mansions.
From the train station, walk up to the main Rambla de Nostra Senyora and cut to the right up C/Sant Joan to the enclosed Plaça de Sant Joan, which has a small daily produce market. A rather larger affair takes place every Saturday, when the stalls also stock clothes, household goods, handicrafts and agricultural gear. The Festa Major, meanwhile, at the end of August and the first couple of days in September, brings the place to a standstill: dances and parades clog the streets, while the festival is renowned for its display of castellers – teams of people competing to build human towers.
Vinseum
Pl. Jaume I 5 • May–Sept Tues–Sat 10am–7pm, Sun & hols 10am–2pm; Oct–April Tues–Sat 10am–2pm & 4–7pm, Sun & hols 10am–2pm • €7 • 938 900 582, vinseum.cat
Vilafranca’s town museum, the Vinseum, is housed in a medieval mansion in the centre, and is the best place to get to grips with the region’s wine industry. Exhibitions range far and wide, with the emphasis as much on local traditions and culture as wine. Visits culminate with a tasting in the museum’s own tavern, which is open daily until 11pm on weekdays and until midnight at the weekend.
Torres
3km northwest of Vilafranca • Mon–Sat 9.15am–4.45pm, Sun & hols 9.15am–1pm • Tours of varying lengths, some with food as well, from €9 • 938 177 487, clubtorres.com
The vineyards of Vilafranca are all out of town, though the largest and best-known winery, Torres, is only a short taxi ride away, on the Sant Martí de Sarroca road. Launched in 1870 by Jaime Torres, this family-run behemoth is one of Spain’s most recognizable wine brands – and offers a superb array of tours, including a stroll through the Mas Plana vineyards. Also owned by Torres is Jean Leon at Torrelavit, closer to Sant Sadurní.
Parés Baltà
Masia Can Baltà, Pacs del Penedès, just west of Vilafranca • Daily tours 9.30am–6.30pm; reservations necessary • from €10 • 938 901 399, paresbalta.com
This is one of the smaller family-run wineries in L’Alt Penedès, which offer a unique alternative to the biggies. Parés Baltà, helmed by two women winemakers, focuses on organic wines, and offers a variety of tours around its lovely property. In some parts, the vineyards grow amid wild parkland – Parés Baltà is one of the few producers in Spain with vineyards in a natural park, the Parc del Foix. Pick up a bottle of the award-winning rosé Parés Baltà Ros de Pacs.
ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE: L’ALT PENEDÈS
By train Renfe services from Pl. de Catalunya or Barcelona Sants (Mon–Fri every 30min, Sat & Sun every 1hr, renfe.com) run west into L’Alt Penedès, calling at Sant Sadurní d’Anoia (40min) and Vilafranca del Penedès (50min).
EATING AND DRINKING
VILAFRANCA DEL PENEDÈS
La Fàbrica C/Hermenegild Clascar 4 938 171 538, restaurantlafabrica.com. This Japanese-Mediterranean fusion spot inside an old pasta factory has an excellent lunchtime menu (€12), as well as à la carte offerings that range from (quite fittingly) home-made pastas to tempura and sushi (mains €8–17). Mon–Sat 1.15–3.30pm & 8.30–11.30pm.
Inzolia C/Palma 21, off C/Sant Joan 938 181 938, inzolia.com. The most agreeable place in town to sample the local wines – a range of cavas and wines is sold by the glass, and there’s a good wine shop attached. Mon–Sat 10am–3pm & 5–10pm.
Tarragona
Majestically sited on a rocky hill, perched directly above the sea 100km southwest of Barcelona, TARRAGONA is an ancient place: settled originally by Iberians and then Carthaginians, it was later used as the base for the Roman conquest of the peninsula, which began in 218 BC with Scipio’s march south against Hannibal. The fortified city became an imperial resort and, under the Emperor Augustus, who lived here for two years, “Tarraco” was the most elegant and cultured city of Roman Spain, boasting at its peak a quarter of a million inhabitants.
Tarragona today is still a very handsome city – especially the upper town, with the sweeping Rambla Nova at its heart, lined with cafés and restaurants. The parallel Rambla Vella marks the start of the old town, while to either side of the ramblas is scattered a profusion of relics and monuments from Tarragona’s Roman past. The city also holds a wide range of museums, dedicated among other things to modern art, the port and harbour, and the noble Castellarnau family – the city highlight is the archeology museum. Note that most of the sights are closed on Mondays, though the Catedral, old town and the exterior of certain Roman remains can still be seen.

Catedral
Pl. de la Seu • Mid-March to mid-June & mid-Sept to Oct Mon–Sat 10am–7pm; mid-June to mid-Sept Mon–Sat 10am–8pm; Nov to mid-March Mon–Fri 10am–5pm, Sat 10am–7pm • €5, under-16s €3, under-7s free, includes entry to Museu Diocesà • 977 247 069, catedraldetarragona.com
The focal point of the medieval old town, the Catedral is a site of great antiquity; the Christian church was built over the provincial Roman forum. Sitting at the top of a broad flight of steps, the main facade presents a soaring Gothic portal framed by Romanesque doors, surmounted by a cross and an elaborate rose window. Other than during services, entrance to the cathedral is through the lovely cloisters (claustre; signposted up a street to the left of the facade), where among several oddly sculpted capitals is one representing a cat’s funeral being directed by rats. The ticket also gives access to the Museu Diocesà, piled high with ecclesiastical treasures, including impressive altarpieces and detailed goldwork.
Museu Nacional Arqueològic
Pl. del Rei 5 • June–Sept Tues–Sat 9.30am–8.30pm, Sun 10am–2pm; Oct–May Tues–Sat 9.30am–6pm, Sun 10am–2pm • €4.50 • 977 236 209, mnat.cat
The huge collection of the modern Museu Nacional Arqueològic, on the seaward edge of the old town, is largely devoted to the Roman era, and serves as a marvellous reflection of the richness of imperial Tarraco. Thematic displays cover the various remains and buildings around the city, as well as whole rooms devoted to statues, inscriptions, ceramics, jewellery, mosaics – including a colourful floor mosaic depicting dozens of species of fish – and some remarkable glass vessels.
Museum tickets also include admission to Tarraco’s ancient necropolis – a twenty-minute walk from the centre, down Avinguda Ramon i Cajal, off Rambla Nova – where both pagan and Christian tombs have been uncovered.
Roman Tarragona: Museu d’Història de Tarragona
April–Sept Tues–Sat 9am–9pm, Sun & hols 9am–3pm; Oct–March Tues–Sat 9am–7pm, Sun & hols 9am–3pm • Each site €3.30, joint ticket to all €11.05, under-16s free • 977 242 220, tarragona.cat
Most of Tarragona’s Roman sites are grouped under the umbrella of the Museu d’Història de Tarragona (Tarragona History Museum), and share the same opening hours. These start most spectacularly with the Pretori i Circ Romans (entered from Pl. del Rei), built at the end of the first century AD to hold chariot races. The vaults and chambers have been restored to spectacular effect, while a lift takes you up to the roof of the Pretorium Tower – which chillingly still served as a prison in the post-Civil War years – for the best view in Tarragona, looking down over the nearby Amfiteatre. There may only be scant remains of the ceremonial provincial forum (Pl. del Fòrum), but the Fòrum Local (C/Lleida, a short walk west of Rambla Nova, near the central market) is far more impressive, where the evocative remains of a temple, shops, Roman road and house foundations can still be seen.
Aqüeducte de les Ferreres
Off N240, Lleida road • Open access • Free • Take the bus marked “Sant Salvador” (every 30min; 10min) from the stop outside Av. Prat de la Riba 11 (western end of Rambla Nova and off Av. Ramon i Cajal)
Arguably Tarragona’s most remarkable monument, the Roman aqueduct that brought water to the city from the Riu Gayo, some 32km distant, stands 4km outside the original city walls. Its most impressive surviving section, nearly 220m long and 26m high, lies in an overgrown valley, off the main road, in the middle of nowhere, and is popularly known as the Pont del Diable (“Devil’s Bridge”).
Local beaches
The rocky coastline below Tarragona conceals a couple of reasonable beaches. The closest to town is the long Platja del Miracle, over the rail lines below the amphitheatre, but Platja Arrabassada, a couple of kilometres further up the coast, is nicer by far, and holds a smattering of beach bars. Reach it on a pleasant thirty-minute walk by taking Via Augusta off the end of Rambla Vella.
CULINARY DAY-TRIP TO THE CAMPS SISTERS
Catalunya is justly famous for its wildly progressive cuisine, but this culinary stardom was born in the region’s traditional dishes, many of which reveal Catalunya’s natural bounty. For a taste, turn to les germanes Camps (the Camps sisters) at Hostal Colomí (C/Raval de Jesús 12, 977 880 653; Tues–Sun 1–4pm) in the lovely historical town of Santa Coloma de Queralt, about 50km northwest of Tarragona. For many, Hostal Colomí, which was founded in 1948, isn’t just the best traditional Catalan cuisine in the Tarragona region. It’s the best in the country. The meal starts with two large porrons (pitchers) of wine – one white, one red – and a platter of pa amb tomàquet (bread smeared in tomato and drizzled in olive oil). The feast continues, including warm ham croquettes, cod and platters of grilled meat and asparagus from the open-air grill, culminating in dessert – crema Catalana, of course. Best of all: the set lunch menu is an excellent deal, at €15.
ARRIVAL AND INFORMATION: TARRAGONA
By train Hourly AVE (high-speed) trains from Barcelona Sants take just 35min, but tickets are expensive and the Camp de Tarragona AVE station is a 10min drive from the centre of town, which adds on the price of a taxi. Otherwise, normal trains from Estació França, Pg. de Gràcia and Barcelona Sants (every 30min; renfe.com) take just over an hour: turn right out of the station, and climb the steps ahead of you to reach Rambla Nova, by the statue of Roger de Llúria (10min).
Oficina de Turisme C/Major 39 (July–Sept Mon–Sat 10am–8pm, Sun & hols 10am–2pm; Oct–June Mon–Fri 10am–2pm & 3–5pm, Sat 10am–2pm & 3–7pm, Sun & hols 10am–2pm; 977 250 795, tarragonaturisme.cat).
EATING
The pretty old-town squares, like Pl. del Rei, Pl. del Fòrum and Pl. de la Font, are the best places for outdoor drinks and meals. The last in particular features more than a dozen cafés, bars and restaurants serving everything from pintxos to pizzas. Otherwise, for a tasty paella lunch it’s worth heading down to Tarragona’s so-called fishermen’s quarter, Serrallo, a 15min walk west along the industrial harbourfront from the train station.

AQ Restaurant C/Coques 7 977 215 954, aq-restaurant.com. This handsome restaurant – done up in gleaming blonde wood and sleek furnishings – has impressive cuisine to match (main dishes €18–25). Husband-and-wife team Quintín and Ana (after whom the restaurant is named) serve up seasonal food with flair, including superb fresh fish and shellfish and grilled meats. Tues–Sat 1.30–3.30pm & 8.30–11pm.
Els Arcs Misser Sitges 13 977 218 040, restaurantarcs.com. Ancient, graceful stone arches preside over a cosy dining room. Fresh Mediterranean dishes include a salad of citrus-marinated quail and octopus risotto with artichokes. Expect to pay around €40/person, without drinks. Tues–Sat 1.30–3.30pm & 8.30–10.30pm.
El Llagut C/Natzaret 10, at Pl. del Rei 977 228 938. A top town-centre spot for seafood and rice dishes, with a quiet terrassa opposite the archeological museum, and a welcoming staff. There’s a great set-lunch deal from €13; otherwise à la carte meals cost around €22–27. July & Aug daily 1–4pm & 8.30pm–midnight; Sept–June Mon 1–4pm, Tues–Sat 1–4pm & 8.30pm–midnight.
Racó de l’Abat C/Abat 2 977 780 371, abatrestaurant.com. Beamed ceilings and crimson plaster walls give this Catalan restaurant – located in a former palace dating from the sixteenth century – an intimate, heritage vibe. The menú del dia starts at €15, while most mains (fresh fish, grilled meats) cost around €12–16. June–Sept daily 1–4pm & 8–11pm; Oct–May Mon–Thurs & Sun 1–4pm, Fri 1–4pm & 8–11pm, Sat 8–11pm.
Reus
The charming little city of Reus, 100km southwest of Barcelona and 14km northwest of Tarragona, was the birthplace in 1852 of architect Antoni Gaudí, though there was little in his early life to indicate what was to come. He was born to a humble family of boilermakers and coppersmiths, and left for Barcelona when he was 16 years old. Even though there are no Gaudí buildings in Reus, however, it does hold a fascinating interpretive centre dedicated to its most famous son. The Gaudí Centre forms part of the city’s Ruta del Modernisme, a marked trail around the many buildings and mansions erected in the modernista style at the end of the nineteenth century and start of the twentieth, when Reus ranked as Catalunya’s second city after Barcelona, and was home to a merchant class made wealthy by the trade in wine and olive oil and, later, textiles, fabrics and ceramics. You can easily see all of Reus’s sights in a day out from Barcelona – it’s full of pretty squares, good restaurants and handsome pedestrianized shopping streets, with almost everything of note lying within a clearly defined circuit of boulevards.

Gaudí Centre
Pl. del Mercadal 3 • Mid-June to mid-Sept Mon–Sat 10am–8pm, Sun & hols 11am–2pm; mid-Sept to mid-June Mon–Sat 10am–2pm & 4–7pm, Sun & hols 11am–2pm • €9, under-14s €5, under-8s free • 977 010 670, gaudicentre.com
The Gaudí Centre, a gleaming building on the main square, throws considerable light on the inspiration, methodology and craftsmanship behind Gaudí’s work.
It’s not really a museum as such, though exhibits include copper vessels made by his father; school reports announcing the young Gaudí to be “outstanding” at geometry; his only surviving manuscript notebook; and a reconstruction of his study-workshop at the Sagrada Família. Instead, the centre cleverly investigates the architectural techniques pioneered by Gaudí, with meticulous hands-on models and audiovisual aids that explain, for example, how he created wave roofs and spiral towers. If you ever wondered why none of Gaudí’s door frames is straight, or what trees, ferns and snails have to do with architecture, this is undoubtedly the place to find out.
Casa Navàs
Pl. del Mercadal 5 • Tours every Sat at 10.30am, 11.30am & 12.30pm, check with Oficina de Turisme; reservations required • €10, under-7s free, includes Gaudí Centre
Antoni Gaudí may never have built in Reus, but his contemporary, Lluís Domènech i Montaner, was responsible for Reus’s finest townhouse, the magnificently decorated Casa Navàs (1901), across Plaça del Mercadal from the Gaudí Centre. It’s still privately owned, but is open for pre-booked tours of the virtually intact period interior, which you shuffle around in overshoes to protect the floor.
Plaça del Mercadal itself used to be the site of the general market – the numbers you can see etched in the square’s paving indicated the position of the stalls.
Sant Pere and around
Pl. de Sant Pere • Daily 10.30am–1pm & 4–8pm • Free
Reus’s main church, dedicated to its patron saint, Sant Pere, is a couple of minutes’ walk from the Gaudí Centre. This is where Gaudí was baptized (there’s a plaque by the baptismal chapel) and the church also boasts the heart of Reus’s number-two son, modernista artist Marià Fortuny i Marsal (the plaque here reads “he gave his soul to heaven, his fame to the world, and his heart to his country”).
The arcaded square with cafés behind the church, Plaça de les Peixateries Velles, was once the local fish market.
Gaudí’s birthplace
C/de Sant Vicenç 4
Divert a few minutes from the commercial centre to see Gaudí’s birthplace. The house is not original, but a plaque marks the site itself, and there’s a rather touching sculpture of the young Gaudí playing marbles outside a school just down the street.
ARRIVAL AND INFORMATION: REUS
By plane Reus Airport, 3km east of town and served by Ryanair flights from the UK, offers connecting buses direct to Barcelona, while local bus #50 runs hourly into town, via the train station.
By train There are hourly Renfe services (renfe.com) to Reus (via Tarragona) from Pg. de Gràcia and Barcelona Sants; the journey takes 1hr 40min. Taxis wait outside the station, or you can walk to the centre in 15min – head down Pg. Sunyer, turn left at Pl. de les Oques, and follow C/Sant Joan to Pl. del Prim.
Oficina de Turisme Pl. del Mercadal, inside the Gaudí Centre (mid-June to mid-Sept Mon–Sat 10am–8pm, Sun & hols 11am–2pm; mid-Sept to mid-June Mon–Sat 10am–2pm & 4–7pm, Sun & hols 11am–2pm; 977 010 670, reusturisme.cat). You can pick up a good map of town, and ask about guided tours (not always in English).
EATING
Restaurants are plentiful, with a particular concentration around Pl. del Mercadal and along nearby C/Santa Anna. The daily market (Mon–Sat) takes place at the Mercat Central on C/Sant Joan, not far from the train station.

La Glorieta del Castell Pl. del Castell 2 977 340 826, restaurantlaglorietadelcastell.com. A traditional place, with market-led Catalan cuisine and good-value menús del dia day and night (from €17.50, otherwise €12–25). Mains include grilled bream with artichokes or roast duck with rosemary. Mon & Wed–Sat 1–4pm & 8.30–11.30pm, Sun 1–4pm.
Restaurant Joan Urgellès C/Aleus 7 977 342 178, joanurgelles.com. Top-notch contemporary cuisine, with excellent fresh seafood, like cod with apple aioli. Daily menus from €19.50. Mon 8.30–11pm, Tues–Sat 1.30–4pm & 8.30–11pm.
Reineta C/Jurats 28 977 313 296. Fill up on Catalan comfort food at this friendly family restaurant. Changing seasonal dishes include fresh cod, cannelloni filled with foie gras and rice topped with lobster. Tasting menus start at €25. Tues–Sat 1–4pm & 8.30–11pm, Sun 1–4pm.
Girona
The ancient walled city of GIRONA stands on a fortress-like hill, high above the Riu Onyar, 100km northeast of Barcelona but now barely forty minutes by train. Fought over in almost every century since this site held the Roman fortress of Gerunda, it has been rebuilt and added to many times: following the Moorish conquest of Spain, Girona was an Arab town for over two centuries, and there was also a continuous Jewish presence for six hundred years – which resulted in El Call, one of the best-preserved Jewish quarters in Europe. In short: Girona is an overwhelmingly beautiful medieval city, with old and new towns divided by the river, which is crisscrossed by footbridges, with pastel-coloured houses reflected in the waters below. The compact wedge of land that comprises the old town contains all the sights and monuments, making historic Girona an easy and very enjoyable day-trip from Barcelona.

Catedral
Pl. de la Catedral • April–Oct Mon–Sat 10am–6.30pm (July–Aug 10am–7.30pm), Nov–March Mon–Sat 10am–5.30pm, Sun 1–5.30pm • €7, includes audio-guide, Sun free & under-7s free • catedraldegirona.org
The centrepiece of old Girona, its mighty Gothic Catedral, is approached by a magnificent flight of seventeenth-century Baroque steps. Inside, there are no aisles, just one tremendous Gothic nave vault with a span of 22m. Such emphasis on width and height is a defining feature of Catalan-Gothic “hall churches”, of which this is the ultimate example. The cathedral treasures include the famous eleventh-century “Creation Tapestry”, the finest surviving specimen of Romanesque textile. But it’s the exquisite Romanesque cloisters (1180–1210) that make the strongest impression, boasting minutely carved figures and scenes on double columns.
Banys Àrabs
C/Ferran el Catòlic • March–Oct Mon–Sat 10am–7pm, Sun & hols 10am–2pm; Nov–Feb Mon–Sat 10am–2pm • €2, under-16s €1 • 972 190 797, banysarabs.org
The intact remains of Girona’s Banys Àrabs, reached via the twin-towered Portal de Sobreportas below the cathedral, are the best-preserved ancient baths in Spain after those at Granada. Despite the name, they date from the thirteenth century, a couple of hundred years after the Moors’ occupation of Girona had ended, and they’re a very graceful blend of Romanesque and Moorish elements, albeit probably built by Moorish craftsmen. It only takes fifteen minutes or so to explore the three principal rooms, each designed for different temperatures, with an underfloor heating system.
Museu d’Història de Girona
C/de la Força 27 • May–Sept Tues–Sat 10.30am–6.30pm, Sun 10.30am–1.30pm; Oct–April Tues–Sat 10.30am–5.30pm, Sun 10.30am–1.30pm • €4, under-16s free • 972 222 229, www.girona.cat/museuhistoria
Girona’s excellent history museum, the Museu d’Història de Girona, a couple of streets down from the cathedral, traces the city’s story from its origins as Parva Gerunda up to the Franco era. Its most beautiful exhibits are unquestionably its Roman mosaics, but there’s an especially interesting room devoted to the trades practised in the medieval city. The museum staff can offer suggestions on historical walking tours around the city, which are also well marked on their website (and downloadable in PDF form).
Museu Arqueològic
Monestir de Sant Pere de Galligants, C/Santa Llúcia 8 • May–Sept Tues–Sat 10.30am–7pm, Sun 10am–2pm; Oct–April Tues–Sat 10am–6pm, Sun 10am–2pm • €4.50, under-8s free • 972 202 632, www.mac.cat
From the cathedral square, the main street, Pujada Rei Martí, leads downhill to the Riu Galligants, a small tributary of the Onyar. The Museu Arqueològic stands on the far bank in the former monastic church of Sant Pere de Galligants, a harmonious setting for displays of Roman statuary, sarcophagi and mosaics. The beautiful Romanesque cloisters contain heavier medieval relics, such as inscribed tablets and stones, including some bearing Jewish inscriptions.
Passeig Arqueològic
Daily 8am–10pm • Free
Near the archeological museum, steps up through landscaped grounds lead onto the walls of the old city. You can walk right around their perimeter on the Passeig Arqueològic, or archeological route, and enjoy views out over the rooftops and the cathedral. There are endless little diversions along the way, into old watchtowers, down blind dead ends and around crumpled sections of masonry.
The Jewish quarter
Quite apart from its Roman remains and Arab influences, Girona also contains one of the most intact Jewish quarters in Western Europe, El Call, on and around C/de la Força. At its height it was home to around three hundred people who formed a sort of independent town within Girona, protected by the king in return for payment. From the eleventh century onwards, however, the Jewish community suffered systematic persecution and, until the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, the quarter was effectively a ghetto, its residents restricted to its limits and forced to wear distinguishing clothing if they did leave.
Museu d’Història dels Jueus
C/Força 8 • July & Aug Mon–Sat 10am–8pm, Sun & hols 10am–2pm; Sept–June Mon, Sun & hols 10am–2pm, Tues–Sat 10am–6pm • €4, free 1st Sun of month • 972 216 761, girona.cat/call
For an impression of the cultural and social life of Girona’s medieval Jewish community, visit the Museu d’Història dels Jueus, sited up the skinniest of stepped streets. It’s a huge, labyrinthine complex, much of it so heavily restored that you’d never be able to tell exactly which of its many rooms, staircases, courtyards and buildings held the synagogue, the butcher’s shop, the baths and other community buildings and services, but everything is very beautifully displayed and explained.
Museu del Cinema
C/Sèquia 1 • May, June & Sept Tues–Sat 10am–8pm, Sun & hols 11am–3pm; July & Aug daily 10am–8pm; Oct–April Tues–Fri 10am–6pm, Sat 10am–8pm, Sun & hols 11am–3pm; • €5, under-14s free, free 1st Sun of month • 972 412 777, www.museudelcinema.cat
The superb Museu del Cinema, based on an extraordinary private collection, is less a museum and more of what the curators call “cinema before cinema”, with an utterly intriguing array of the gadgets and artefacts that provided popular entertainment before cinema itself came along, from Indonesian shadow puppets to eighteenth- and nineteenth-century devices like phantasmagoria, fantascopes and magic lanterns. It’s all rounded up with movie memorabilia including costumes from Tootsie and Hello Dolly.
Mercat del Lleó
Plaça Calvet i Rubalcaba • Mon–Thurs & Sat 7am–3pm, Fri 5–8pm • Free • 972 483 749, mercatlleo.cat
Barcelona has the famous Boqueria; Girona’s version is the Mercat del Lleó, a lively, colourful, aromatic market that unfolds just east of the river. The sixty-plus stalls reflect the natural diversity of Catalunya – apples and pears from fragrant Girona orchards, mushrooms pulled from Pyrennean soil, pungent goat cheeses and vast displays of still-twitching seafood from the Mediterranean. Take a twirl through the market for a whiff of local flavour, and then refuel over a café at the market bar.
ARRIVAL AND INFORMATION: GIRONA
By plane Regular bus services run from Girona airport, 12km south of the city, to Girona, Barcelona or the Costa Brava.

EATING
Girona is a festive city, with myriad spots to enjoy cocktails and cuisine. Cafés and restaurants abound along Rambla de la Llibertat and the parallel Pl. del Vi, and there’s also a group of bars with lovely terraces at the opposite end of the old town, under Sant Feliu church. Another dozen or so restaurants, all with alfresco terraces, stand just over the river in pretty Pl. Independencia. Plus, Girona is home to this restaurant that’s on many culinary bucket lists: El Celler de Can Roca. Make reservations far in advance, and prepare to indulge – it’s worth it.

★El Celler de Can Roca Can Sunyer 48, off Yaialà road 2.5km northwest of the centre 972 222 157, cellercanroca.com. Eat your way across Catalunya at the spectacular, Michelin-starred El Celler de Can Roca, which was hailed as the world’s best restaurant by Restaurant magazine in 2013 and 2015. Founded by the three Roca brothers – head chef Joan, sommelier Josep and dessert master Jordi – the restaurant showcases dishes that celebrate the remarkably fertile region of Girona. Among the 17-plus courses: a tiny olive tree is hung with melting balls of olive-oil ice cream; and langoustine enveloped in a cocoa bean sauce is served in a bowl the shape of a cocoa bean. Tasting menus start at €175, and reservations are of course essential. Your best bet is to book online – reservations are accepted up to 11 months in advance; a new month becomes available at midnight on the 1st day of every month. Tues 9–11pm, Wed–Sat 1–3.30pm & 9–11pm; closed from end Dec to mid-Jan, 1 week in Aug and during Easter.
Divinum C/Albareda 7 872 080 218, divinum.cat. Sleek restaurant serving top-notch modern Catalan cuisine, with individual dishes like foie gras with black garlic or steak tartare at €14–26, and a wonderful €45 tasting menu (€73 with wine). Mon–Sat 1.30–3.45pm & 8.30–11pm.
König C/Calderes 16 972 225 782, konig.cat. With its pretty terrassa under the high walls of Sant Feliu church, this all-day café-bar makes a pleasant stop for a drink. Food (€4–8) is along the lines of salads, tapas, sandwiches and burgers. Daily 8am–midnight.
Rocambolesc C/Clara 50 972 416 667, rocambolesc.com. It doesn’t get much better than spooning up ice cream inside a gelateria that looks like a tiny candy factory. This adorable gelateria is run by Jordi Roca, the youngest brother and dessert chef at El Celler de Can Roca, along with his wife. Creative flavours include dulce de leche with guava jam and cotton candy, and caramelized apple with shortbread. Scoops from around €5. Mon–Thurs noon–9.30pm, Fri noon–11pm, Sat 11am–11pm, Sun 11am–9pm.
★Sentits Travessera de la Creu 33 972 299 386, restaurantsentits.com. Living up to its name, this elegant little spot appeals to all the senses (sentits). The menu springs from the hyper-local “Km 0” concept – seafood from the lonja (fish auction) at Blanes and Arenys de Mar, and vegetables from the gardens of the verdant Maresme along the Mediterranean. Dishes include smoked aubergine cream served with anchovies from nearby Escala. Mains €12–21. Mon–Thurs 1–4pm, Fri 1–4pm & 8–11pm.
Figueres and around
Figueres’ most famous resident has passed away – but his legacy lives on, and on, in this provincial town (pop: 45,700) in northern Catalunya. Salvador Dalí, who was born in Figeures, founded the eponymous Museu Dalí, which is installed in a building as surreal as the exhibits within. Figueres is a popular day-trip from Barcelona, as ultra-fast trains take less than an hour to make the 135km journey northeast of the city. The museum is very much the main event in town, though it’s easy to fill in the rest of the day in the handsome centre. Pavement cafés line the tree-shaded rambla, while art galleries, clothes stores and gift shops line the pedestrianized streets and squares. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, you’ll coincide with the main fruit, veg and flower market – Thursday is best, since there’s also a huge clothes market. As Figueres is a “tourist town”, shops in the historic centre are allowed to open on Sundays and holidays.
The surrounding Empordà wine region (doemporda.cat) holds as much allure as Figueres itself. This verdant wine country, which unfolds inland from the Costa Brava, has been producing wine since the fifth century when the Phoenicians first settled in the area. While mainly known for its naturally sweet Garnatxa, the region is undergoing a renaissance, with new, creative small-batch winemakers developing a wide variety of blends. Over fifty wineries fill the region, which is flanked by the Pyrenees on one side and the Mediterranean on the other, extending from Figueres north to the French border, and south through Baix Emporda. Rich soils and a balmy Mediterranean climate ensure a flourishing harvest, but there’s also something else that’s special to the region: the strong Tramuntana winds, which help protect the vines from disease and frost. Turisme Costa Brava Girona has launched a DO (Denominació d’Origen) Empordà Wine Route (costabrava.org/what-to-do/wine-and-gastronomy/wine-route), which features a range of recommended wineries, hotels and restaurants.

SURREAL SALVADOR
Salvador Dalí i Domènech (1904–89) was born in Figueres – you can see the exterior of his birthplace, which is marked with a plaque, at C/Monturiol 6, as well as that of the Dalí family’s next home, at no. 10. He gave his first exhibition in the town’s municipal theatre when he was just 14 and, after a stint at the Royal Academy of Art in Madrid (he was expelled), he made his way to Paris, where he established himself at the forefront of the Surrealist movement. A celebrity artist in the US in the 1940s and 1950s, he returned eventually to Europe where, among other projects, he set about reconstructing the now-defunct theatre. This opened as the Museu Dalí in 1974, which Dalí then fashioned into an inspired repository for his works.
By 1980, Dalí was growing increasingly frail. After suffering severe burns in a fire in 1984, he moved into the Torre Galatea, the tower adjacent to the museum, and controversy surrounded his final years. Spanish government officials and friends feared that he was manipulated in his senile condition. Allegations that he signed blank canvases has inevitably led to doubts over the authenticity of some of his later works. Dalí died in Figueres on January 23, 1989. His body now lies behind a simple granite slab inside the museum.
Museu Dalí
Pl. Gala i Salvador Dalí • March–May Tues–Sun 9.30am–6pm; June daily 9.30am–6pm; July & Sept daily 9am–8pm; Aug daily 9am–8pm & 10pm–1am; Oct Tues–Sun 9.30am–6pm; Nov–Feb Tues–Sun 10.30am–6pm; last admission always 45min before closing • €14, under-8s free • 972 677 500, salvador-dali.org
The Museu Dalí appeals to everyone’s innate love of fantasy, absurdity and participation. While it’s not a collection of Dalí’s greatest hits – those are scattered far and wide – what you do get beggars description, and should not be missed.
The building (a former theatre) is an exhibit in itself, topped by a huge metallic dome and decorated with a line of luminous egg shapes. Outlandish sculptures and statues adorn the square and facade, and things get even crazier inside, where the walls of the circular courtyard are ringed by stylized mannequins preparing to dive from the heights. Below sits the famous Rainy Cadillac, where you can water the snail-encrusted occupants of a steamy Cadillac by feeding it with coins. In the Mae West Room an unnerving portrait of the actress is revealed by peering through a mirror at giant nostrils, red lips and hanging tresses, while elsewhere you’ll find a complete life-sized orchestra, some of Dalí’s extraordinary furniture (like the fish-tail bed) and ranks of Surrealist paintings – including one room dominated by the ceiling fresco of the huge feet of Dalí and Gala (his Russian wife and muse).
The museum also contains many of Dalí’s own collection of works by other artists, from Catalan contemporaries to El Greco, and there are temporary exhibitions, too, while your ticket also allows admission to see the Dalí-Joies – a collection of extraordinary jewels, designed in the 1940s for an American millionaire and displayed here with Dalí’s original drawings.
ARRIVAL AND INFORMATION: FIGUERES
By train High-speed trains from Barcelona Sants and Pg. de Gràcia take just 53min to reach the Figueres Vilafant TGV station, 1.5km west of the centre; somewhat less frequent slower trains from the same Barcelona stations take up to 2hr and stop at Figueres’ original station, 1km east of the centre. Both routes are operated by Renfe (renfe.com). Fares vary for each specific train, but broadly speaking you can expect to pay around €28 round-trip for the slower route, more like €36 for the faster one. All trains call at Girona, which is around 15min from Figueres on the fast route, 30–40min on the slower. The “Museu Dalí” is signposted from both Figueres stations, and there’s also a €2 bus from the TGV station.
Oficina de Turisme Pl. del Sol, in front of the post office building (late June to mid-Sept Mon–Sat 9am–8pm, Sun 10am–3pm; mid-Sept to late June Mon–Sat 10am–2pm & 4–7pm, Sun 10am–2pm; 972 503 155, visitfigueres.cat).
EATING
A gaggle of largely missable tourist restaurants is crowded into the narrow streets around the Dalí museum, while more cafés and restaurants overlook the rambla. Lunch menus everywhere go for €10–14, with the sunniest seats to be found at the top of the rambla. Elsewhere, there’s a better selection of hidden-away restaurants that are more geared to locals, where the food tends to be more interesting and authentic.

Can Jeroni C/Castelló 36 972 500 983, canjeroni.com. Locals flock to this tiled tavern opposite the market, where country-style dishes and grills (torrades, salads, steaks, sausages) go for €8–19. Mid-Sept to mid-June Mon–Thurs 8am–3.30pm, Fri & Sat 8am–3.30pm & 8.30–10pm; mid-June to mid-Sept Mon, Tues & Sat 8am–3.30pm, Wed–Fri 8am–3.30pm & 8.30–10pm.
★El Motel Avgda. Salvador Dalí i Domènech 170 972 500 562, hotelemporda.com. When famous Catalan chefs talk about inspiration, one restaurant is regularly mentioned: El Motel, which is considered the birthplace of modern Catalan cuisine. Josep Mercader opened El Motel in 1961 in Figueres, where he brought together the elegance and creamy richness of French cuisine and the natural bounty of Catalunya. Mercader’s son-in-law, chef and hotelier Jaume Subirós, now runs this iconic restaurant, serving quietly profound Catalan dishes like a salad of pomegranate, ceps (porcini mushrooms) and pine nuts; and Empordà quail with pork cracklings. Mains €25. Daily 1–3.30pm & 8.30–10.30pm.
Hotel Duran C/Lausaca 5 972 501 250, hotelduran.com. A top choice in town, known for its excellent regional cuisine, including fresh fish landed daily from the nearby coast. Mains €15–28, and there’s a reasonable lunchtime menu from €20. Daily 12.45–4pm & 8.30–11pm.

This tiny tapas joint in the southern reaches of Barri Gòtic whips up beautifully prepared small plates – including an excellent truita (tortilla), rich patatons a la sal (salted new potatoes with romesco sauce) and tender carpaccio de pop (octopus carpaccio).

	Moss-green paintwork, marble tables and a chequered black-and-white tiled floor create a timeless look for this popular little cafe-bar.

Girona
Pop 97,227
Northern Catalonia’s largest city is a jewellery box of museums, galleries and Gothic churches, strung around a tangle of cobbled lanes and medieval walls. Reflections of Modernista mansions shimmer in the Riu Onyar, which demarcates the historic centre on its right bank from the gleaming commercial centre on the left.
The Roman town of Gerunda lay on Vía Augusta, the highway from Cádiz all the way to the Pyrenees. Taken from the Muslims by the Franks in the late 8th century, Girona became the capital of one of Catalonia’s most important counties, falling under the sway of Barcelona in the late 9th century.
Girona’s wealth in medieval times produced many fine Romanesque and Gothic buildings that have survived repeated attacks and sieges. There are also traces of a Jewish community that flourished in Girona until their expulsion in 1492. These cultural riches are packed into Girona’s walkable centre. With Catalonia’s most diverse nightlife and dining scene outside Barcelona, Girona makes a delicious distraction for a few days, before you’re helplessly drawn to the coast.

CATHEDRAL
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.catedraldegirona.org; Plaça de la Catedral; adult/student incl Basílica de Sant Feliu €7/5, Sun free; h10am-7.30pm Apr-Oct, 10am-6.30pm Nov-Mar)
Towering over a flight of 86 steps rising from Plaça de la Catedral, this edifice is far more ancient than its billowing baroque facade suggests. Built over an old Roman forum, parts of the cathedral's foundations date from the 5th century. Today, Gothic styling – built over the Romanesque church during the 14th century – dominates, though a fine, double-columned Romanesque cloister dates from the 12th century. It's a surprisingly formidable sight to explore, but an audio guide is included in the price.
oMuseu d’Història dels Jueus de GironaMUSEUM
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.girona.cat/call; Carrer de la Força 8; adult/child €4/free; h10am-6pm Mon-Sat, to 2pm Sun)
Until 1492 Girona was home to Catalonia’s second most important medieval Jewish community (after Barcelona), and one of the finest Jewish quarters in the country. The Call was centred on the narrow Carrer de la Força for 600 years, until relentless persecution forced the Jews out of Spain. This excellent museum shows genuine pride in Girona’s Jewish heritage without shying away from the less salubrious aspects, such as persecution by the Inquisition and forced conversions.
Museu del CinemaMUSEUM
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.museudelcinema.cat; Carrer de Sèquia 1; adult/child €5/free; h10am-6pm Tue-Fri, 10am-8pm Sat, 11am-3pm Sun; c)
There is much more to this museum than the silver screen. Displays examine the reasons why humanity longs to indulge its imagination, probing the origins of visual storytelling, such as Chinese and Indian shadow puppets. It’s a whistle-stop tour taking in the invention of the camera obscura, the 19th-century debut of the Lumière brothers, and optical illusions using mirrors and trickery of light. There is a vast assortment of displays to poke, play with and peer through.
Museu d’ArtGALLERY
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.museuart.com; Plaça de la Catedral 12; admission €4.50; h10am-7pm Tue-Sat May-Sep, to 6pm Oct-Apr, 10am-2pm Sun)
Next door to the cathedral, in the 12th- to 16th-century Palau Episcopal, this art museum impresses with the scale and variety of its collection. Around 8500 pieces of art, mostly from this region, make up the collection, which ranges from Romanesque woodcarvings and stained-glass tables to modernist paintings of the city by Mela Mutter and early-20th-century sculptures by influential Rafael Masó i Valentí.
Monestir de Sant Pere de GalligantsMONASTERY
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mac.cat; Carrer de Santa Llúcia; adult/child €4.50/3.50; h10am-6pm Tue-Sat, 10am-2pm Sun)
This beautiful 11th- and 12th-century Romanesque Benedectine monastery has a sublime bell tower and a lovely cloister featuring otherworldly animals and mythical creatures on the capitals of its double columns – there are some great ones in the church too. It's also home to the Museu Arqueològic ( GOOGLE MAP ; Carrer de Santa Llúcia; incl with Monestir entry; h10am-6pm Tue-Sat, 10am-2pm Sun). Weekday opening hours from June to September run until 7pm.

A walk along Girona’s medieval walls is a wonderful way to appreciate the city landscape from above. There are several points of access, the most popular being across the street from the Banys Àrabs, where steps lead up into some heavenly gardens where town and plants merge into one organic masterpiece. The southernmost part of the wall ends right near Plaça de Catalunya.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.girona.cat/museuciutat; Carrer de la Força 27; adult/student/child €4/2/free; h10.30am-5.30pm Tue-Sat, to 1.30pm Sun)
This museum’s setting within 18th-century cloisters lends an appropriately antique feel to your journey from Roman Girona to the present day. Standout displays include an exhibition illuminating the 3rd- to 4th-century Can Pau Birol mosaic, which depicts a lively circus scene with charioteers, and an explanation of the siege of Girona by Napoleonic troops. Many pieces on display are copies rather than originals, making this a place to unpeel the layers of Girona's history rather than goggle at sculpture and art.
Basílica de Sant FeliuCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Plaça de Sant Feliu; adult/student incl Catedral €7/5, Sun free; h10am-5.30pm Mon-Sat, 1-5.30pm Sun)
Just downhill from the cathedral is Girona’s second great church, with its landmark truncated bell tower. The nave is majestic with Gothic ribbed vaulting, while St Narcissus, the patron of the city, is venerated in an enormous marble-and-jasper, late-baroque side chapel. Underneath his reclining form you see scenes from his life including the conversion of women, martyrdom and expelling of an evil genie. To the side is the Gothic sepulchre, dating from 1328, that previously held his remains. A decent audio guide tour is included with admission.
Banys ÀrabsRUINS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.banysarabs.cat; Carrer de Ferràn el Catòlic; adult/child €2/1; h10am-7pm Mon-Sat, to 2pm Sun Apr-Sep, 10am-2pm daily Oct-Mar)
Although modelled on earlier Muslim and Roman bathhouses, the Banys Àrabs are a finely preserved, 12th-century Christian affair in Romanesque style. The baths contain an apodyterium (changing room), followed by a frigidarium and tepidarium (with respectively cold and warm water) and a caldarium (a kind of sauna) heated by an underfloor furnace.
GIRONAMUSEUS CARD

The GironaMuseus card (www.gironamuseus.cat) covers six Girona museums including the Museu d’Història dels Jueus de Girona, Museu d'Art, Museu d’Història de Girona, Monestir de Sant Pere de Galligants and the Museu del Cinema. It provides useful savings – you pay the full entrance fee at the first museum you visit and then get a 50% discount at the remainder. It’s valid for six months.

The most atmospheric accommodation choices are in the old town, and there's a good sprinkling of apartments for rent and hostels too.

It's the former home of Catalan artist Jaume Busquets i Mollera, and retains period details in each of the five individually styled rooms.

Book ahead for the decadent 'Eros suite', boasting a tantric sex sofa (with a handy instruction manual).
GIRONA'S JEWS

In its 13th-century heyday, Girona was home to one of Catalonia's largest Jewish communities, who lived by and large peacefully alongside their Christian neighbours, gaining in prosperity and contributing to fields as diverse as astronomy and medicine.
Nevertheless the Jewish community came under attack, especially during the later crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries. The Call – a maze of tiny alleys, surrounded by a stone wall – went from refuge to ghetto as Jews were gradually confined to their tiny corner of the town. Especially stomach-churning were the ‘Disputes’, rigged debates intended to ridicule pillars of the Jewish community against the supposedly superior logic of Christians. The spin of the day reported that these debates led to mass conversions, but the likelier story is that Jews converted out of heavy pressure and fear. Slander against Jews became increasingly grotesque, with tales of murdered Christian infants.
Things came to a head during a riot in 1391, when a mob broke into the ghetto, massacring 40 residents. Since the Jews were still under the king’s protection, troops were sent in and the survivors were confined to the Galligants Tower ‘for their own safety’ for 17 weeks, only to find their houses and possessions destroyed when they came out. Many converted to Christianity during the 15th century. In 1492 those who remained were expelled from Spain, ending a story that had been over 1500 years in the making.

WHAT'S COOKING IN CATALONIA?
Cuina Catalana rivals Basque cuisine as Spain’s best, drawing ingredients from mar i muntanya (sea and mountain). It has come a long way since medieval recipes for roast cat with garlic: its essence now lies in its sauces for meat and fish. There are five main types: sofregit, of fried onion, tomato and garlic; samfaina, sofregit plus red pepper and aubergine or zucchini (courgette); picada, based on ground almonds, usually with garlic, parsley, pine nuts or hazelnuts, and sometimes breadcrumbs; allioli, garlic pounded with olive oil and egg yolk to make a mayonnaise; and romesco, an almond, tomato, olive oil, garlic and vinegar sauce, also used as a salad dressing.
Calçots, which are a type of long spring onion, are delicious as a starter with romesco sauce and are in season in late winter/early spring. This is when Catalans get together for a calçotada, the local version of a barbecue.
Catalans seem to live on pa amb tomàquet, bread slices rubbed with tomato, olive oil and garlic.

For 21 years, this little wildlife sanctuary has been a haven for Hermann's tortoises, and a force for educating people about these little armoured tanks of the Pyrenees. There's an introductory film (Catalana, Spanish, English, French or German) explaining menaces to the region's tortoises, but the biggest thrill is a stroll around the boardwalk outside, to peep at scores of critters ambling among rocks and flower beds. The sanctuary is just north of Garriguella, a teeny town 15km northeast of Figueres.


Figueres
Pop 45,444
Twelve kilometres inland from Catalonia's glistening Golf de Roses lies Figueres, birthplace of Salvador Dalí and now home to the artist’s flamboyant theatre-museum. Although Dalí’s career took him to Madrid, Barcelona, Paris and the USA, Figueres remained close to his heart; so in the 1960s and '70s he created the extraordinary Teatre-Museu Dalí – a monument to surrealism and a legacy that outshines any other Spanish artist, both in terms of popularity and sheer flamboyance. Whatever your feelings about this complex, egocentric man, this museum is worth every cent and minute you can spare.
Beyond this star attraction, busy Figueres has a couple of interesting museums, pleasant shopping streets around Carrer de Peralada, and a whopping 18th-century fortress. It’s well worth staying to see the city breathe after Dalí day-trippers board their buses at sundown.
DALÍ

One of the 20th century’s most recognisable icons, Salvador Dalí (1904–89) could have had the term ‘larger-than-life’ invented for him. He then would probably have decorated it with pink pineapples.
Born in Figueres, Dalí’s surrealist trajectory through the often-serious landscape of 20th-century Spain brought him into contact and collaboration with figures such as Pablo Picasso, Luís Buñuel, Federico García Lorca and (controversially) Franco. A raft of foreign celebrities flocked to be seen in his extravagant company. He turned his hand to everything from film-making to architecture to literature.
Self-consciously eccentric and a constant source of memorable soundbites, he was nevertheless in some ways a conservative figure and devout Catholic. His long relationship with his Russian wife Gala provided the stable foundation that his whirligig life revolved around.
The celebrity, the extraordinarily prolific output and, let’s face it, the comedy moustache tend to pull focus from the fact that he was an artist of the highest calibre. In his paintings, Dalí’s surrealism is often far more profound than it seems at first glance. The floppy clocks of his most famous work, The Persistence of Memory, are interpreted by some as a reference to the flexibility of time proposed by Einstein. His Christ of St John of the Cross combines expert composition, symbol-laden Renaissance-style imagery and a nostalgic, almost elegiac view of the Catalan coast that he so loved.

The first name that comes into your head when you lay your eyes on this red castle-like building, topped with giant eggs and stylised Oscar-like statues and studded with plaster-covered croissants, is Dalí. An entirely appropriate final resting place for the master of surrealism, it has assured his immortality. Exhibits within these walls range from enormous installations - like Taxi Plujós (Rainy Taxi), an early Cadillac, surmounted by statues – to the more discreet, such as a tiny mysterious room with a mirrored flamingo.

This sturdy 18th-century fortress commands the surrounding plains from a low hill 1km northwest of the centre. The complex is a wonder of military engineering: it sprawls over 32 hectares, with the capacity for 6000 men to march within its walls and snooze in military barracks that are on display today. The admission fee includes a clanking audio guide (nearly as old as the castle) to help navigate the site. Book ahead for group guided tours (€10 to €15 per person). Opening hours vary seasonally.

This museum has more than 3500 toys from throughout the ages – from the earliest board games involving coloured stones to ball-in-a-cup to intricate dolls’ houses to 1920s dolls with baleful stares that may haunt your dreams to Catalonia- and Valencia-made religious processions of tiny figures. It's a mesmerising display, with plenty to amuse the kids... that is, unless you're the kind to associate blank-eyed Victorian dolls with horror movies. Admission is half-price if you flash a Teatre-Museu Dalí ticket.
Museu de l’EmpordàMUSEUM
( GOOGLE MAP ; www.museuemporda.org; La Rambla 2; adult/child €4/free; h11am-8pm Tue-Sat, to 2pm Sun)
Across four floors, this local museum time travels from ancient amphorae to 7th-century sculptures to rotating installations of contemporary art. The region's culture and history are presented in a rather fragmented way, but it's an enjoyable romp. The 17th-century religious art is especially worthy of attention. There are signs in Spanish and Catalan, plus explanation on laminated cards in English and French. Admission is free with a Teatre-Museu Dalí ticket.
VISITING THE TEATRE-MUSEU DALÍ

The Teatre-Museu Dalí is Spain's most visited museum outside Madrid, so it's worthwhile double-checking the opening hours (it's closed on Mondays) and reserving tickets online in advance. In August the museum opens at night from 10pm to 12.30am (admission €13, bookings essential).
The biggest crowds arrive during weekends and on public holidays. Arrive early to avoid long queues.

Anyone familiar with Picasso’s Guernica already has a tiny insight into the horror of civilian suffering during Spain’s Civil War. This museum traces the experiences of Catalonian people exiled and persecuted during this era. This thought-provoking museum is aptly located in the town of La Jonquera, close to the Spain–France border where many were forced to flee. It explains the build-up to the Spanish Civil War through photographs, an informative audio guide, and haunting art installations.
Besalú
Pop 2400
The broad but elegant 12th-century Pont Fortificat (Fortified Bridge) over Río Fluvià in medieval Besalú, with its two tower gates and heavy portcullis, is an arresting sight, leading you into the coiled maze of cobbled narrow streets that make up the core of this delightfully well-preserved town. Following a succession of Roman, Visigothic and Muslim rulers, during the 10th and 11th centuries Besalú was the capital of an independent county that stretched as far west as Cerdanya before it came under Barcelona’s control in 1111. Today it's a favourite day-trip destination from Girona, with a steady stream of visitors roaming the ramparts and exploring Besalú's Jewish history.
1Sights
oPont FortificatBRIDGE
Besalú’s fortified stone bridge is so old, it strains memory. The first records of the bridge date to 1075, though periodic modifications have bolstered its defensive structure. It was bombed in 1939 during the Spanish Civil War and repaired soon after. Today this pale sandstone bridge, with its sturdy tower and portcullis, is a vantage point for the loveliest views of medieval Besalú.

Prepare to squint with increasing intensity as you enter this peculiar museum opposite Monestir de Sant Pere. Peer through a magnifying glass at jewellery, figurines and tiny dioramas from around the world, including ants wielding parasols, Lilliputian re-creations of the siege of Troy, and retina-spraining Mexican skulls. The third of the museum's three rooms has a row of microscopes above creations invisible to the naked eye, including Besalú's bridge on a pin's head and camels passing through the eye of a needle.
Jewish SquareRUINS
(Baixada de Mikwe; guided tours €2.20)
Besalú’s thriving Jewish community fled the town in 1436 after relentless Christian persecution. They left behind a miqvé (ritual bath) dating from the 12th century, a rare survivor of its kind in Spain, which was only rediscovered in 1964. It sits down by the river inside a vaulted stone chamber, around which remnants of the 13th-century synagogue were unearthed during excavations in 2005. Access to the miqvé is by guided tour, but you can see the square and ruin exterior independently.

The N260 road from Figueres to Olot meets the C66 from Girona at Besalú.
THE PYRENEES
Catalonia's Pyrenees are more than an all-season adventure playground. Certainly, the Val d'Aran draws skiers and snowboarders in winter, with resorts ranging from red-carpet to family-friendly. Summer and autumn lure hikers to the jewel-like lakes and valleys of the Parc Nacional d’Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici and the climbing terrain of the Serra del Cadí.
But there is also Catalan heritage to be discovered amid the breathtaking scenery. Centuries-old monasteries slumber in these mountains, meaning treks in the Pyrenees are as likely to bypass ruined Romanesque churches as offer a valley panorama. Tastebuds yearning for more than hiking fodder will find satisfaction in the rich gastronomy of Garrotxa's volcanic zone. Beyond the big-ticket sights and major resorts, Catalonia's Pyrenees conceal a raw beauty that awaits discovery.
OUT & ABOUT IN THE PYRENEES

The Catalan Pyrenees provide magnificent walking and trekking. You can undertake strolls of a few hours, or day walks that can be strung together into treks of several days. Nearly all can be done without camping gear, with nights spent in villages or refugis (no-frills mountain shelters).
Most of the refugis are run by two Barcelona mountain clubs, the Federació d’Entitats Excursionistes de Catalunya (FEEC; www.feec.org) and the Centre Excursionista de Catalunya (CEC; www.cec.cat), which also provide info on trails. A night in a refugi costs around €12.50 to €18. Moderately priced meals (around €15 to €20) are sometimes available in high season. It's worth calling ahead to assure your place (in summer, refugis can fill up, and in shoulder season, many are closed) and to ask if cooking facilities are available.
The coast-to-coast GR11 long-distance trail network traverses the entire Pyrenees from Cap de Creus on the Costa Brava to Hondarribia on the Bay of Biscay. The tougher HRP (Haute Randonnée Pyrénéenne), recommended only for the hardiest and most experienced trekkers, takes you higher up into the mountains, crossing the Spanish–French border several times.
The season for walking in the high Pyrenees is from late June to early October. Always be prepared for fast-changing conditions, no matter when you go.
Local advice from tourist offices, park rangers, mountain refugis and other walkers is invaluable. Dedicated hiking maps are essential.
There’s boundless scope for climbing – Pedraforca in the Serra del Cadí offers some of the most exciting ascents.
Olot
Pop 972 / Elev 443m
If you perceive a rumbling sensation during your travels in Olot, it might be more than your belly bemoaning that over-sized crema catalana. More than 100 small earthquakes set Catalonia trembling each year, though most are barely perceptible. The scenery in Garrotxa, a lush region of cone-shaped hills spreading from regional capital Olot, was chiselled by more extreme geological activity 70,000 years ago.
Olot is a good base for exploring the area. The town spreads over a large area, with broad, tree-lined boulevards, but the medieval centre is agreeably walkable.
1Sights
Four hills of volcanic origin stand sentry on the fringes of Olot. Walk up Volcà del Montsacopa, 500m north of the centre, or Volcà de la Garrinada, 1km northeast of the centre, both of which are volcanic craters.

LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
VOLCANIC CUISINE

In Olot and around, a dedicated group of chefs proudly carries on the cuina volcànica culinary tradition, which stems from the exceptionally fertile volcanic soil, responsible for a bounty of locally grown produce that forms the base of this hearty cuisine. Ingredients include black radishes, wild mushrooms, Santa Pau beans, ratafia (liquor with aromatic herbs, sometimes flavoured with walnut) and piumoc (dry pork sausage).

Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa
The hills around Olot are volcanic in origin, making up the 120 sq km Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa. Volcanic eruptions began here about 350,000 years ago, but the last one was 11,500 years ago. As the African and Eurasian tectonic plates nudge ever closer (at a rate of 2cm per year), the occasional mild earthquake still sends a shiver across Garrotxa. But the volcanoes have long snoozed under a blanket of meadows and oak forests.
The park completely surrounds Olot but the most interesting area is between Olot and the village of Santa Pau, 10km southeast. In the park there are about 40 volcanic cones, up to 160m high and 1.5km wide. Together with the lush vegetation, a result of fertile soils and a damp climate, these create a landscape of verdant beauty. Between the woods are crop fields, a few hamlets and scattered old stone farmhouses and Romanesque churches.

While opening hours to this imposing building are limited, its broad Romanesque form makes for a pleasant view if you want to pause between Olot and the dramatic cliffs of Castellfollit de la Roca.
2Activities
There are 28 hiking routes around the natural park, most of which are clearly signposted. A number of easy walking trails lead directly from the car parks near Olot and Santa Pau to the volcanic cones. Inquire at the park information office Casal dels Volcans in Olot, where you can collect helpful hiking maps and info on trails. The basalt lava flows near the town of Sant Joan les Fonts are an especially stunning place to walk.

Ripoll
Pop 10,751 / Elev 691m
With an impressive monastery at Ripoll’s heart, and another close by in tiny Sant Joan de les Abadesses, this otherwise unremarkable town is a worthy stopover for admirers of Romanesque art.
Ripoll can claim, with some justice, to be the birthplace of Catalonia. In the 9th century it was the power base from which local strongman Guifré el Pilós (Wilfred the Hairy) succeeded in uniting several counties of the Frankish March along the southern side of the Pyrenees. Guifré went on to become the first in a line of hereditary counts of Barcelona. To encourage repopulation of the Pyrenean valleys, he founded the Monestir de Santa Maria, the most powerful monastery of medieval Catalonia – and was buried there after death.
Ripoll is well situated for rambling the dormant volcanoes of Garrotxa, 30km east, or the vertiginous hiking and skiing terrain around the Vall de Ribes, 13km north.

Consecrated in AD 888, the Monestir de Santa Maria was Catalonia’s spiritual and cultural heart from the mid-10th to mid-11th centuries. The five-naved basilica was adorned in about 1100 with a stone portal that ranks among the most splendid Romanesque art in Spain. The well restored basilica interior has admirable floor mosaics, a display about the Bibles of Ripoll (rare illustrated manuscripts created between 1008 and 1020), plus the tomb of Guifré el Pilós, who founded the monastery.
DON'T MISS
DRAGONS, GIANTS & BIG HEADS

Fire and fireworks play a big part in many Spanish festivals, but Catalonia adds a special twist with the correfoc (fire-running), in which devil and dragon figures run through the streets spitting fireworks at the crowds.
Correfocs are often part of the festa major, a town or village’s main annual festival, which usually takes place in July or August. Part of the festa major fun are the sardana (Catalonia’s national folk dance) and gegants, splendidly attired 5m-high giants that parade through the streets or dance in the squares. Giants tend to come in male-and-female pairs, such as a medieval king and queen. Almost every town and village has its own pair, or up to six pairs, of giants. They’re accompanied by grotesque ‘dwarfs’ (known as capsgrossos, or ‘big-heads’).
On La Nit de Sant Joan (23 June), big bonfires burn at crossroads and town squares in a combined midsummer and St John’s Eve celebration, and fireworks explode all night. The supreme fire festival is the Patum in Berga, 30km west of Ripoll. An evening of dancing and firework-spitting angels, devils, mulelike monsters, dwarfs, giants and men covered in grass culminates in a mass frenzy of fire and smoke. Patum happens on Corpus Christi (the Thursday 60 days after Easter Sunday).

(www.monestirsantjoanabadesses.cat; Plaça de l’Abadia; admission €3; h10am-2pm & 4-6pm Mon-Sat Mar-Oct, 10am-2pm Mon-Sat Nov-Feb)
Who gallops through the hills around Sant Joan de les Abadesses on stormy nights, engulfed in flames and accompanied by ravenous black dogs? If you believe the stories, it's the legendary cursed Count Arnau, whose association with the Monestir de Sant Joan de les Abadesses has bequeathed it a heritage of brooding fairytales alongside its centuries of spiritual activity. The monastery is worth a visit for both its architectural treasures and the count's legend, richly illustrated in a permanent display.
8Getting There & Away
Sant Joan de les Abadesses is 10km east of Ripoll on the N260 to Olot; there is a small free car park for tourists just north of the main road, signposted as you enter the town centre.
Teisa (www.teisa-bus.com) operates buses more than hourly weekdays and two-hourly at weekends from Ripoll (€1.95, 15 minutes).
Vall de Núria & Ribes de Freser
A trio of little towns populate the Vall de Ribes and Vall de Núria, southeast of Cerdanya and north of Ripoll. Here spectacular ragged hills, pine forests and plummeting dales are squeezed between the Serra Cavallera and Serra de Montgrony ranges, rippling north to the Capçaleres del Ter i del Freser mountains.
Sheltered within the Vall de Ribes is the small but well-equipped town of Ribes de Freser, 13km north of Ripoll. A further 6km north lies Queralbs, a charming stone village perched at an altitude of 1180m. Beyond here, and accessible only by cremallera (rack railway), is Núria (1960m to 2252m). This lofty valley holds the sanctuary of the Mare de Déu de Núria icon, though in winter it draws as many winter-sports devotees as pilgrims. Reaching Núria by cremallera is a worthy day trip for its views alone: the train rattles past lichen-streaked rubble, waterfalls, patches of forest, and gaping valleys.
1Sights
oSantuari de la Mare de DéuCHURCH
(www.valldenuria.cat; Núria; h8am-6.30pm)F
The sanctuary (1911) sits incongruously in the centre of a building (now a hotel) that emits an unfortunate boarding-school vibe. A pastel-painted passageway trimmed with gold leads visitors from the main church to the upper level, housing the Mare de Déu de Núria behind a glass screen above the altar. Mary, with a regal expression, sits in star-spangled robes, clasping a grown-up Jesus. The icon is in 12th-century Romanesque style, despite believers insisting that Sant Gil sculpted it back in AD 700.

In winter, Núria transforms into a small-scale ski resort with 11 short runs. Much of the terrain is geared towards beginners, though there are two red (intermediate) and black (advanced) slopes to keep more experienced skiers and boarders busy for an afternoon. There’s also a separate kids' activity area with tobogganing in winter and pony rides in summer.

The more centrally located Ribes-Vila is a cremallera (%973 73 20 20; www.valldenuria.cat; Ribes-Núria 1-way/return adult €14.25/22.80, child €8.55/13.70) stop between lower station Ribes-Enllaç and Queralbs, along the line to Núria (which isn't reachable by car). These trains run from Ribes de Freser to Núria via Queralbs six to 12 times a day (35 minutes, 20 from Queralbs), depending on the season. There are car parks at Ribes-Enllaç and Queralbs if you are making a day trip to Núria via cremallera.
Cerdanya
Cerdanya, along with French Cerdagne across the border, occupies a low-lying green basin between the higher reaches of the Pyrenees to the east and west. Although Cerdanya and Cerdagne, once a single Catalan county, were divided by the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, Catalan is spoken on both sides of the border and Spain flows seamlessly into France.
Puigcerdà
Pop 8761 / Elev 1202m
Barely 2km from France, Puigcerdà (puh-cher-da) dates back to the 12th century – not that you’d know it, since it lost most of its historical buildings during the civil war. The town’s not much more than a waystation, but it’s a jolly one, teeming with hikers in summer and used as a base by skiers during the winter season. A dozen Spanish, Andorran and French ski resorts lie within 45km.
1Sights
Estany de PuigcerdàLAKE
( GOOGLE MAP )
The estany (lake) in the north of town was created during the 13th century for irrigation purposes. Today it's a superb spot for a stroll: rowing boats and birdlife bob across its surface in summer, while winter amplifies the majesty of the snow-streaked mountains visible from the shore. The lake is surrounded by turn-of-the-20th-century summer houses, built by wealthy Barcelona families.

5Eating
Pop a button for local speciality trinxat, a fried flan of potato and cabbage, garnished with strips of crisp pork belly. Cargols (snails) are also popular in this region. For its size, Puigcerdà has a very good selection of fine dining and casual tapas options, many of which cluster around Plaça Santa Maria and along Carrer Alfons I.

The bus and train stations are at the foot of the hill, just southwest of central Puigcerdà.
ALSA (www.alsa.es) buses run to/from Barcelona (€20.40, three hours, one or two daily) and La Seu d’Urgell (€6.90, one hour, four to six daily).
From Barcelona, the C16 approaches Puigcerdà through the Túnel del Cadí. Puigcerdà is also reachable via the picturesque N260 from Ribes de Freser. The main crossing into France is at Bourg-Madame, immediately east of Puigcerdà.
Rodalies trains run from Barcelona to Puigcerdà (€12, 2½ to three hours, six daily) via Vic, Ripoll and Ribes de Freser. Four to five a day continue across the border to Latour-de-Carol, where you can connect to the French network.
Llívia
Pop 1536 / Elev 1224m
Look twice at your map of the Spain–France border. Just 6km northeast of Puigcerdà, amid verdant meadows and little French villages, is Llívia, a tiny bastion of Catalonia beyond the main border between France and Spain. Under the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees, Spain ceded 33 villages to France, but Llívia was a ‘town’ and so, together with the 13 sq km of its municipality, remained a Spanish possession. Much more than just a cartographical oddity, this small town has a charming medieval centre and more excellent restaurants than you might expect for its size. The majority of visitors arrive to hike the hills during summer, and to access ski resorts on the Spanish and French sides of the Pyrenees.
1Sights
Llívia’s few sights lie in its tiny medieval nucleus near the top of town, including the entertaining Museu Municipal and the 15th-century Gothic Església de Mara de Déu dels Àngels, which has three defensive towers around it. The ruined castle above the town is little more than wall remnants; find hiking trail maps for the surrounding area in the tourist office.

Beautifully prepared Catalan food with a whisper of French flair. Aptly for a restaurant within a 1791 building, traditional Catalan flavours have pride of place, like grilled octopus, slow-cooked lamb and smoky trinxat, but you'll also taste hints of Asian fusion. Desserts like a silky mousse of fromage blanc (sweet white cheese) and bilberries, or steamy chocolate fondant, are an irresistible finish.
8Getting There & Away
Four to eight ALSA (www.alsa.es) buses run from Puigcerdà to Llívia daily (€1.70, 20 minutes).
La Molina & Masella
These ski resorts lie either side of Tosa d’Alp (2537m), 15km south of Puigcerdà, and are linked by the Alp 2500 lift. La Molina and Masella Ski Resorts (www.lamolina.cat; day lift pass adult/child €41/31; h9am-4pm late Nov-late Apr) have a combined total of 135km of runs of all grades at altitudes of 1600m to over 2500m. Rental equipment and ski schools are available at both resorts; La Molina is better for beginners. Lift passes cover the whole area. In the summer, La Molina caters to adrenalin junkies with its mountain-bike park, quad-biking and more.

This homey hotel in a stone building offers a personal touch and historic charm unlike many of the region's resort choices. Just 2.5km below the slopes, this hotel is an excellent choice for families with its rotating daily activities for kids, plus a games room, garden and pool. Rooms are compact and simple, and the staff are bursting not only with skiing advice (ask about piste pass discounts) but suggestions for summer activities too.
8Getting There & Away
In the ski season there’s a bus service from Puigcerdà to the ski area plus infrequent daily services from Llívia via Puigcerdà to La Molina's telecabina (cable car; 7.40am), and regular buses from La Molina town (€2) up to the slopes. The easiest driving route from Barcelona is by the C58 toll road and the C16 through the Túnel del Cadí.
La Seu d'Urgell
Pop 12,366 / Elev 691m
The lively valley town of La Seu d’Urgell (la se-u dur-zhey) is Spain’s gateway to Andorra, 10km to the north. La Seu has an attractive medieval centre, watched over by an admirable Romanesque cathedral. When the Franks evicted the Muslims from this part of the Pyrenees in the early 9th century, they made La Seu a bishopric and capital of the counts of Urgell; it remains an important market and cathedral town.

Dominating La Seu d'Urgell's old town on the southern side of Plaça dels Oms is the 12th-century Catedral de Santa Maria. This pale sandstone cathedral complex is one of Catalonia’s outstanding Romanesque buildings. Its neat cloister is rich in characterful carved capitals depicting mythical beasts and grimacing gargoyles.

WORTH A TRIP
ANDORRA

If you're on the lookout for great hiking or skiing, are keen to stock up on duty-free booze, smokes or electronics, or just want to say you've been in a different country, then the curious nation of Andorra, just 10km north of Seu d'Urgell, is for you. At only 468 sq km, it's one of Europe's smallest countries and, though it has a democratic parliament, the nominal heads of state are two co-princes: the bishop of Urgell in Spain, and the President of France. Catalan is the official tongue, though Spanish, French and, due to a large immigrant workforce, Portuguese are widely spoken. Regular buses run from Seu d'Urgell to the busy capital, Andorra la Vella. If driving, make sure to fuel up in Andorra, as it's significantly cheaper. There's rarely any passport control, though you may well be stopped by customs on the way back into Spain, so don't go over the duty-free limit.
Pallars Sobirà
The Riu Noguera Pallaresa tumbles south from the heights of the Val d’Aran, the pristine scenery of Pallars Sobirà extending from both sides. West of the river lies the Parc Nacional Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici; to its east, the vast Parc Natural de l’Alt Pirineu, spangled with lonely Romanesque churches among which weave hiking trails.
The river itself draws rafters and other adventure-sports enthusiasts to the small towns along its banks, principally (from north to south) Llavorsí, Rialp and Sort. Each of these towns is well-equipped with accommodation, cafes and restaurants, though outside the March to October season, they are very quiet.
2Activities
The Riu Noguera Pallaresa’s grade IV drops attract a constant stream of white-water fans between mid-March and mid-October. It’s usually at its best in May and June.
The best stretch is the 12km from Llavorsí to Rialp, on which the standard raft outing costs around €41 per person for two hours. Longer rides to Sort and beyond will cost more, and Sort is the jumping-off point for the river’s tougher grade IV rapids.
In Llavorsí, there are several rafting operators, most of whom offer a full range of summer activities including kayaking, canyoning, horse-riding, rock-climbing and canoeing as well as some winter programs. Operators include Roc Roi (%973 62 20 35; www.rocroi.com; Plaça Biuse 8, Llavorsí; 1hr rafting from €38; hmid-Mar–mid-Oct), Rafting Llavorsí (%973 62 21 58; http://raftingllavorsi.cat; Camí de Riberies, Llavorsí; half-day rafting €60) and, for more experienced rafters, Yeti Emotions (%973 62 22 01; www.yetiemotions.com; Carrer de Borda Era d’Alfons, Llavorsí).

PYRENEAN BACK ROADS

As beautiful and dramatic as Vall de la Noguera Pallaresa and Val d’Aran are, they can certainly feel rather overrun in summertime by rafters and hikers. If you’re looking for solitude and adventure off the beaten track, take the B-roads up into the hills northeast of Llavorsí and Esterri d’Àneu, or else north of Vielha, leading to some remote and, in parts, tough mountain-walking country along and across the Andorran and French borders. Highlights include glacial lakes and the ascent of the Pica d’Estats (3143m), the highest peak in Catalonia.
Parc Nacional d'Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici & Around
Catalonia’s only national park extends 20km east to west, and only 9km from north to south. But the rugged terrain within this small area sparkles with more than 400 lakes and countless streams and waterfalls, combined with a backdrop of pine and fir forests, and open bush and grassland, bedecked with wildflowers in spring and fringed with scarlet leaves in autumn.
Created by glacial action over two million years, the park is essentially two east–west valleys at 1600m to 2000m altitudes lined by jagged 2600m to 2900m peaks of granite and slate.
The national park lies at the core of a wider wilderness area. The outer limit is known as the zona periférica and includes some magnificent high country to the north and south.
The main approaches are via the village of Espot, 4km east of the park and 8km away from Estany de Sant Maurici lake, and Vall de Boí, part of its western sector.

Together these 11th- to 14th-century constructions were declared a Unesco World Heritage site in 2000. Kick-start your architectural odyssey with a visit to this interpretation centre.

The central apse contains a copy of a famous 1123 mural that now resides in Barcelona’s Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya. At the church’s centre is a Pantocrator (Christ figure), whose rich Mozarabic-influenced colours, and expressive but superhuman features, have become a virtual emblem of Catalan Romanesque art.

SERRA DEL CADÍ

The spectacular Serra del Cadí offers a string of picturesque villages and mountains that offer excellent walking for those suitably equipped and experienced. The range’s most spectacular peak is Pedraforca ('Stone Pitchfork', 2497m), which offers the most challenging rock climbing in Catalonia, while the main Cadí range, part of Parc Natural Cadí-Moixeró, has a number of staffed refuges in the park for serious multiday hikes.
The villages used as jumping-off points for exploring the area are strung along the picturesque B400, which runs west from the Barcelona-bound C16 from Puigcerdà to La Seu d’Urgell on the C14. These include Saldes, Gósol, picturesque Josa del Cadí, and Tuixent. The valley makes a spectacular drive too, a longer but super-scenic route between Puigcerdà and La Seu d'Urgell.
Val d'Aran
Catalonia’s northernmost region, famous for its plunging valleys and snowy peaks, is an adventure playground for skiers and snowboarders. Baqueira-Beret's pistes lure the winter-sports jet-set. Meanwhile, charming villages like Salardú enchant hikers with views of cloud-scraping mountains. From Aran’s pretty side valleys, walkers can go over the mountains in any direction, notably southward to the Parc Nacional d’Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici.
It wasn't always this way: the Val d'Aran was an inaccessible outpost until the 1948 completion of a tunnel connecting the valley's main town Vielha to the rest of Spain. A surge of tourism development followed, allowing the world to experience this spectacular region of tumbling valleys dotted with stone-and-slate villages, many with notable Romanesque churches.
Thanks in part to its geography, Aran’s native language is not Catalan but Aranese (Aranés), which is a dialect of Occitan or the langue d’oc, the old Romance language of southern France.
Vielha
Pop 5474 / Elev 974m
A sprawl of stone-and-slate houses, winter-sports shops and holiday apartments make up hectic Vielha, often used as a base for exploring the Val d'Aran. While it doesn't have the charisma of the valley's smaller towns, Vielha's tiny centre, anchored by the distinctive spire of Sant Miquèu church, is packed with rustic restaurants, especially along the banks of the gushing Riu Garona. Vielha's outdoor-gear shops, supermarkets and accommodation choices make it a good place to circle your wagons before hiking or skiing. It's best to have your own wheels: the Vall de Boí's trekking terrain is a 20-minute drive south, while Baqueira's ski resorts are 20 minutes east.

The village snoozes outside peak summer and winter seasons, but is a pretty place to stop year-round: the balconies of its stone houses overflow with flowers while Romanesque Església de Santa Maria, with its three-storey belfry and triple apse, stands proudly in their midst.

Vic
Pop 41,956
This feisty Catalonian town combines dreamy medieval architecture with youthful energy. Remarkably restored Roman ruins and jazzy Modernista houses add to a spirited mix of architectural styles, while Plaça Major smoulders with a palette of ochre and brick-red mansions. The old quarter has meandering laneways that bypass chapels and cosy restaurants.
Despite its resolutely Catalan political outlook, the town is very multicultural; meanwhile its university keeps an activist buzz in the air. A day trip from Barcelona is enough to take in Vic's cathedral and the superb museum, plus a restaurant or two, but a longer stay allows time to get lost amid the street art and medieval alleyways.
1Sights
Plaça Major, the largest square in Catalonia, has a pleasing medley of medieval, baroque and Modernista architecture. A crop of cafes spill onto the square. It’s also the site of Vic’s twice-weekly market (Tuesday and Saturday mornings), which sells local food and cheap clothing. Around it swirl the narrow streets of medieval Vic, lined with mansions, churches and a 1st-century Roman temple, painstakingly restored during the 19th and 20th centuries.

This museum holds a marvellous collection of Romanesque and Gothic art, second only to the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya collection in Barcelona. The Romanesque collection depicts some strikingly gory images – from saints being beheaded or tortured to the Archangel Michael spearing a devil through his jaw.

Within, the Stations of the Cross are animated in colourful World War II–era frescoes, while Corinthian columns glow bronze in the darkness.

Cardona
Pop 4921
Long before arrival, you spy in the distance the outline of an impregnable 18th-century fortress high above Cardona. Once ruled by the self-styled ‘Lords of Salt’, who brought Cardona wealth by mining the Muntanya de Sal (mountain of salt), today the castle (now housing a parador – a sumptuous state-owned hotel) lures tourists to admire its stocky watchtowers and Romanesque church. Aside from this standout attraction, Cardona is a sleepy place, best experienced as an atmospheric day-trip or stopover between Barcelona and the Pyrenees.

Visible long before entering Cardona, this fortress tops a hill that broods above the modern town. From this strategic position, centuries of noblemen have kept a watchful eye over Cardona's Muntanya de Sal (Salt Mountain), the 'white gold' that gave Cardona its wealth. The ramparts have panoramic views of the vast Lleida plain; the loftiest vantage point is the Torre de la Minyona. It's free to wander around the castle, but sights within the complex have separate admission charges.

Lleida
Pop 138,416
Lleida’s battletorn history has faded into memory, replaced by a pacey, workaday vibe. During the 14th and 15th centuries, this arid, inland city was a centre of economic activity, fed in part by Jewish and Muslim communities. Culture and art flourished, thanks to surrounding monasteries and a university founded in 1300. Relics of the holy cloth and thorns made Lleida’s cathedral a revered stopping point on the Way of St James pilgrimage route.
Battle lines were drawn here across Catalonia’s history, with Lleida nearly always backing the losing side. The old town was reduced to rubble during the War of the Spanish Succession. The conquerors built a citadel to protect their new acquisitions, only for it to be sacked by the French in 1812.
The fortress-cathedral crowning the city, La Seu Vella, evokes Lleida’s former grandeur, while a scattering of museums and Modernista buildings offer reasons to linger.

Lleida’s ‘old cathedral’, enclosed within a later fortress complex, towers above the city from its commanding hilltop location. Work began on the cathedral in 1203, though today it is a masterpiece of the Transitional style, with bold Romanesque forms complemented by Gothic vaults and elaborate tracery. The octagonal bell tower, crowned with Gothic flourishes, rises at the southwest end of the beautiful cloisters, a forest of slender columns from which you can gaze at expansive views over Lleida.

The Knights Templar built a monastery complex here shortly after Lleida was taken from the Muslims in 1149. It was later expanded into a fortress in the 17th century. Today you can still see the original Romanesque Església de Santa Maria de Gardeny and a hefty tower. An imaginative audiovisual display (in Spanish or Catalan) lends insight into the monastic life of the Knights Templar.

WORTH A TRIP
CISTERCIAN ROUTE

Cistercian RouteMONASTERIES
(Ruta del Cister; www.larutadelcister.info; combined 3-monastery ticket €12)
A combined ticket gives access to three monasteries on the Cistercian Route, plus discounts on other regional museums. Tackling all three in a single day-trip from Tarragona is doable if you start early, but it requires careful timing: some visits are by irregular guided tours only. Start with Santa Maria de Poblet (whose long lunch hour can disrupt day-trip schedules), before heading to Reial Monestir de Santes Creus. Finish with Santa Maria de Vallbona de les Monges, the latest closing of the trio.
oReial Monestir de Santes CreusMONASTERY
(Plaça de Jaume el Just, Santes Creus; adult/senior & student €4.50/3.50; h10am-6.30pm Jun-Sep, 10am-5pm Oct-May)
An atmosphere of awe descends before entering the monastery, in broad Plaça de Sant Bernat Calbó: its mix of architectural styles spans six centuries, including retired monks' quarters and an ornamental 18th-century fountain. Behind the monastery's Romanesque and Gothic facade lies a 14th-century sandstone cloister, a 12th-century chapter house whose ceiling ripples with rib-shaped vaults, a cavernous dormitory, and royal apartments where the comtes-reis (count-kings; rulers of the joint state of Catalonia and Aragón) often stayed. There's also a church, whose construction began in the 12th century.

The largest monastery of the Cistercian Route, Unesco-listed Santa Maria de Poblet was founded by monks from southern France in 1150. It rose rapidly to become Catalonia’s most powerful monastery. Highlights include the mostly Gothic main cloister and the alabaster sculptural treasures of the Panteón de los Reyes (Kings’ Pantheon). The raised alabaster sarcophagi contain such greats as Jaume I (the conqueror of Mallorca and Valencia) and Pere III. Entry is strictly by semi-guided tours (Catalan and Spanish), which operate every 20 minutes during opening hours.

A dozen monges (nuns) still live and pray at this 12th-century institution, the only women's monastery along the Cistercian Route. The monastery has undergone years of restoration, which has finally cleared up most of the remaining civil-war damage. Queen Violant of Hungary, a queen consort of Aragon and formidable political influencer, is entombed within (note the bilingual plaque outside the monastery in Catalan and Hungarian). Visits are by guided tour (Spanish or Catalan).

It's well located for monastery-hopping along the Cistercian Route and also makes an excellent alternative to staying in central Tarragona (with free parking to boot). Fèlix Hotel is 17km north of Tarragona in quiet Valls.
COSTA DAURADA & AROUND
Sitges
Pop 28,171
Just 35km along the coast southwest of Barcelona, Sitges sizzles with beach life, nightclubs and an enviable clutch of festivals. Sitges has been a resort town since the 19th century, and was a key location for the Modernisme movement, which paved the way for the likes of Picasso. These days it’s Spain’s most famous gay holiday destination. In July and August the town cranks up the volume to become one big beach party, while Carnaval unbridles Sitges’ hedonistic side. But despite bacchanalian nightlife, Sitges remains a classy destination: its array of galleries and museums belie its small size, there’s a good sprinkling of upmarket restaurants in its historic centre, and an October film festival draws culture fiends from miles around. The town is quieter during the off-season, but you can still experience a taste of nightlife and culture.
1Sights
The most beautiful part of Sitges is the headland area, where noble Modernista palaces and mansions strike poses in the streets around the striking Església de Sant Bartomeu i Santa Tecla, with the blue sea as a backdrop.

Built in the 1890s as a house-cum-studio by artist Santiago Rusiñol, a pioneer of the Modernisme movement, this mansion is crammed with his own art and that of his contemporaries, including his friend Picasso, as well as his own collection of ancient relics and antiques. The visual feast is piled high, from Grecian urns and a 15th-century baptismal font to 18th-century tilework that glitters all the way to the floral-painted wood-beamed ceiling.

Within an old wood-beamed fish-market building is this slick 20th-century art gallery. Whitewashed walls and shiny tiled floors draw all eyes to the primary colours of bold pop art and modern art within. Pucker up for Peter Stämpfli's Rouge baiser (an enormous cerise pair of lips), alongside works by Arroyo, Cueco and other greats. The lower floor has rotating temporary exhibitions. The museum runs extended hours in high season.

Housed in a late-18th-century Can Llopis mansion, this faded museum recreates with its furnishings and dioramas the lifestyle of a 19th-century Catalan landowning family. Closed for renovations during our visit, the museum was due to reopen in 2016.
Església de Sant Bartomeu i Santa TeclaCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Plaça de l'Ajuntament)
Sitges' most striking landmark is this 17th-century parish church, sitting proudly on a rocky elevation that separates the 2km-long main beach to the southwest from the smaller, quieter Platja de Sant Sebastià to the northeast. Opening hours vary.
Beaches
The main beach is flanked by the attractive seafront Passeig Maritim, dotted with chiringuitos (beachside bars) and divided into nine sections with different names by a series of breakwaters. West of the centre, Anquines ( GOOGLE MAP ) and Terramar ( GOOGLE MAP ) beaches have paddleboat rental and deck chairs during the summer. East of the headland find St Sebastià ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), Balmins and fine brown-sanded D’aiguadolç beaches. Though Bassa Rodona ( GOOGLE MAP ) used to be the unofficial ‘gay beach’, gay sunbathers are now spread out pretty evenly, while Balmins is the sheltered bay favoured by nudists.

Don’t skip the dessert, either.
6Drinking & Nightlife
Much of Sitges’ nightlife happens on one short pedestrian strip packed night-long in summer: Carrer 1er de Maig aka Calle del Pecado (Sin Street), Plaça de la Indústria and Carrer Marquès de Montroig, all in a short line off the seafront, though most bars shut by around 3.30am. All-night revellers are drawn to the clubs just outside of town; the popular ones change name regularly, but you'll soon find out what is trendy this summer.

CATALAN WINE

Throughout two-and-a-half millennia of wine production, it’s safe to say Catalonia has had time to finesse its local drops. With the days of Roman vineyards and medieval monastery wine-making long past, modern Catalonia now has 12 denominaciones de origen (DO) and has birthed boozy innovations like sparkling cava.
Penedès’ wine country is justly famous for these Champagne-style sparkling wines, ranging in taste from dry and flinty to sweet, plus fruity whites from Macabeo, Xarel·lo and other varietals. Other notable wine-making zones include Priorat, which produces aromatic, full-bodied reds, particularly from cariñena (carignan) and garnacha (grenache) grapes, and Costers del Segre, which comprises several fairly distinct subregions and produces quality whites and reds from a wide variety of grapes including macabeo, chardonnay, monastrell and cabernet sauvignon. The Raimat subregion is particularly worthy of attention. Wine tourism here has seen recent investment, with new routes allowing you to tour vineyards by jeep or bicycle; learn more on www.catalunya.com/what-to-do/enotourism.
Penedès Wine Country
Some of Spain’s finest wines come from the Penedès plains southwest of Barcelona. Sant Sadurní d’Anoia, located about 35km west of Barcelona, is the capital of cava, a sparkling, champagne-style wine popular worldwide, and glugged across Spain, particularly at Christmas. Vilafranca del Penedès, 12km further southwest, is an attractive historical town and the heart of the Penedès Denominació de Origen (DO; Denomination of Origin) region, which produces noteworthy light whites and some very tasty reds.
TASTING IN PENEDES

It’s easier to get around the wine country if you have your own wheels, though several companies run tours of the wineries from Barcelona (which can be a good option, if you’re intent on serious wine sampling). Visitors are welcome to tour several of the region’s wineries, though advance booking is essential in most places. The more enthusiastic ones will show you how cava and/or other wines are made and finish off with a glass or two. Tours generally last about 1½ hours and some may only be in Catalan and/or Spanish.
Browse www.dopenedes.es and www.enoturismepenedes.cat for more wine-tourism options.

Codorníu's wine-making activities are said to be documented right back to the 16th century. Manuel Raventós, credited with bringing this wine-maker into the big time during the late 19th century, was the first to create sparkling Spanish wine by the Champagne method back in 1872.
Giró Ribot (%938 97 40 50; www.giroribot.es; Finca el Pont) The magnificent farm buildings ooze centuries of tradition. This winery uses mostly local grape varieties to produce a limited range of fine cava and wines (including muscat). Visits are seasonal and must be booked in advance. Prices depend on the experience. The winery is 7km north of Vilafranca, just beyond the village of Santa Fe del Penedès.

It revolutionised Spanish wine-making in the 1960s by introducing temperature-controlled, stainless-steel technology and French grape varieties. Torres produces an array of reds and whites of all qualities, using many grape varieties.

To experience Penedès wine country without attaching yourself to a long guided tour or renting a car (a burden, if you want to sip greedily), base yourself in Vilafranca.

In this effervescent port city, Roman history collides with beaches, nightlife and a food scene that perfumes the air with freshly grilled seafood.

A roll-call of excellent places to eat gives you good reason to linger in the knot of lanes in the medieval centre, flanked by a broad cathedral with Gothic flourishes. Tarragona is also a gateway to the Costa Daurada’s sparkling beaches and the feast of Modernisme architecture in nearby Reus.
History
Tarragona was first occupied by the Romans, who called it Tarraco, in 218 BC; prior to that the area was first settled by Iberians, followed by Carthaginians. Scipio launched his successful military endeavours from here, and in 27 BC Augustus made it the capital of his new Tarraconensis province (roughly all modern Spain) and stayed until 25 BC, directing campaigns. During its Roman heyday Tarragona was home to over 200,000 people, and though abandoned when the Muslims arrived in AD 714, the city was reborn as the seat of a Christian archbishopric in the 11th century.

Sitting grandly atop town, Tarragona’s cathedral has both Romanesque and Gothic features, as typified by the main facade. The cloister has Gothic vaulting and Romanesque carved capitals, one of which shows rats conducting a cat’s funeral…until the cat comes back to life! It’s a lesson about passions seemingly lying dormant until they reveal themselves. Chambers off the cloister incorporate the Museu Diocesà, with its large collection extending from Roman hairpins to some lovely 12th- to 14th-century polychrome woodcarvings of a breastfeeding Virgin.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mnat.cat; Plaça del Rei 5; adult/child €4.50/free; h9.30am-6pm Tue-Sat, to 8.30pm Jun-Sep, 10am-2pm Sun)
This excellent museum does justice to the cultural and material wealth of Roman Tarraco. The mosaic collection traces the changing trends – from simple black-and-white designs to complex full-colour creations; a highlight is the large, almost complete Mosaic de Peixos de la Pineda, showing fish and sea creatures. Explanation in the museum is in Catalan and Spanish, but there is a multilingual audio guide included in the price.

Near the beach is this well-preserved amphitheatre, where gladiators hacked away at each other, or wild animals. In its arena are the remains of 6th- and 12th-century churches built to commemorate the martyrdom of the Christian bishop Fructuosus and two deacons, believed to have been burnt alive here in AD 259. Much of the amphitheatre was picked to bits, the stone used to build the port, so what you see now is a partial reconstruction.

A peaceful walk takes you around part of the perimeter of the old town between two lines of city walls. The inner ones are mainly Roman and date back to the 3rd century BC, while the outer ones were put up by the British in 1709 during the War of the Spanish Succession. The earliest stretches are a mighty 4m thick. Prepare to be awed by the vast gateways built by the Iberians and clamber up onto the battlements from the doorway to the right of the entrance for all-encompassing views of the city.
Aqüeducte de les FerreresBRIDGE
(Pont del Diable; GOOGLE MAP ; h9am-dusk)F
This aqueduct sits in a tangle of dusty pathways and glades 4km north of central Tarragona, just off the AP7 freeway (near where it intersects with the N240). It is a fine stretch of two-tiered aqueduct (217m long and 27m high), along which you can totter to the other side. Bus 5 to Sant Salvador from Plaça Imperial de Tàrraco, running every 10 to 20 minutes, will take you close, and you can walk back to the city along the river (about 90 minutes).

This vast Roman-Christian city of the dead on the western edge of town consists of over 2000 elaborate tombs. It was used from the 3rd century AD onwards, thus attesting to Rome’s conversion to Christianity. The museum features curious funereal objects and sarcophagi. Entry is free if you have already purchased a ticket to the Museu Nacional Arqueològic de Tarragona. It opens extended hours in high season.

zFestivals & Events
Festival de Santa TeclaSTREET CARNIVAL
(www.tarragonaturisme.cat/es/eventos/santa-tecla; Tarragona; hmid-Sep)
This colourful 10-day festival brings castells, or human 'castles', to the centre of Tarragona.Teams of castellers stand on each other’s shoulders to build towers up to nine levels high. A death-defying child scrambles to perch at the top before the whole structure gracefully disassembles itself. Watch the spectacle along Rambla Nova and stick around for the fireworks after sundown.
CATALONIA'S HUMAN CASTLES

Among the strangest spectacles in Catalonia are castells, or human ‘castles’. This sport originated in Valls, 20km north of Tarragona, in the 18th century and has since spread to other parts of the region. It involves teams of castellers standing on each other’s shoulders with a death-defying child scrambling up the side of the human tower to perch at the top before the whole structure gracefully disassembles itself; towers up to nine levels high are built. Don’t try this at home. For the most spectacular castells, pay a visit to Tarragona’s Festival de Santa Tecla in mid-September.

Amid a riot of colourful, exuberant Modernista decor, the cordial welcome from this husband-and-wife team guarantees a good atmosphere for dining.

This popular neighbourhood restaurant is a short downhill stroll from the centre. It's deservedly famous for its excellent rice dishes bursting with maritime flavour, and also has great raciones (large plates) of seafood. Don't be fooled by the nautical warehouse interior, fish dishes and jewel-like desserts are executed with finesse.

Eleven kilometres northwest from Tarragona, Reus airport is used by Ryanair, with flights to London, Dublin, Brussels and Frankfurt Hahn among others. Buses (usually timed for flights) run from Tarragona's bus station (20 minutes, €3) as well as from Barcelona (1¾ hours, €15).
The bus station ( GOOGLE MAP ; Plaça Imperial Tarraco) is 1.5km northwest of the old town along Rambla Nova. Destinations include Barcelona (€8.80, 1½ hours, up to 16 daily), Lleida (€5.25, 1¾ hours, three to five daily) and Valencia (€22, three to 4½ hours, six daily).
If checking train times online (www.renfe.com), be wary of two differently located stations in Tarragona. The local train station (Tarragona) is a 10-minute walk from the old town near the beach. There are departures to Barcelona (€8.05 to €20.80, one to 1½ hours, every 30 minutes) and Valencia (€15.20 to €31, two to 3½ hours, 19 daily).
A second out-of-town train station, Camp de Tarragona, lies 10km north of the centre (a 20-minute taxi ride away). There are frequent high-speed trains to Barcelona (€17.30 to €36.50, 35 minutes) and Lleida (€12 to €20, 30 minutes). Make use of hotel transfers if arriving here late at night, as taxis can be erratic.

(www.gaudicentre.cat; Plaça del Mercadal 3, Reus; adult/child €9/5; h10am-2pm & 4-7pm Mon-Sat, 11am-2pm Sun; c)
Reus, 14km west of Tarragona, is the birthplace of visionary architect Antoni Gaudí. Though none of Gaudí's buildings can be found in Reus, he was inspired by many of the historic structures in his home town. The superb Gaudí Centre gives a thorough introduction to the man and his global influence through engaging multilingual and audiovisual displays. The inspiration Gaudí found in nature, as well as his thoughtfulness and humility, are portrayed alongside touchable scale models of his designs.
Delta de L'Ebre
The Delta de l’Ebre, a 20km-long bulge of silt-formed land near Catalonia’s southern border, is laced by waterways that melt into the Balearic Sea. Flamingos and ibis strut in reed-fringed lagoons, dune-backed beaches are lashed by the wind, and marshes reflect sunsets like mirrors.
Seventy-eight square kilometres of this wild and exposed place is the Parc Natural Delta de l’Ebre, northern Spain’s most important waterbird habitat. Migration season (October and November) sees the bird population peak, but birds are also numerous in winter and spring. The park’s flat expanse of waterside trails is ideal for cyclists and ramblers. Exploring this remote and rural landscape, with its whitewashed farmhouses marooned among rice paddies and purple herons posing in ponds, lingers in the memory.
Scruffy, sprawling Deltebre is at the centre of the delta, but push on to smaller villages like Riumar, at the delta’s easternmost point, or Poblenou del Delta.

The garden’s wooden boardwalks weave past local flora, fishermen’s tools and even a llagut, an early 20th-century boat used to haul more than 350 sacks of rice at a time. There is also an aquarium offering a glimpse of the freshwater denizens of the delta. The museum opens shorter hours in low season.

WORTH A TRIP
CASTELL DE MIRAVET

Castell de MiravetCASTLE
(adult/child €3.50/2.30; h10am-5.30pm Tue-Sun, to 8pm summer)
Southern Catalonia's finest castle is at Miravet, 6km off the N420, 60km west of Tarragona. Built in the 11th century, it was reconquered then given to the Templars. It's a formidable stronghold, with incredibly solid walls, and it towers above the pretty village that cascades down a hill on the banks of the Ebro. Opening hours vary seasonally.
Tortosa
Pop 33,932
Arid Tortosa, 70km south of Tarragona and inland from the fertile Delta de l’Ebre, is experiencing a quiet tourism renaissance. It’s a sleepy town, for sure; but with a neck-straining castle, otherworldly sculpture garden and architectural gems spanning Gothic to Modernista styles, it’s carving a small niche for itself as a destination for cultural weekend breaks.
Tortosa was a battleground between medieval Christian and Muslim Spain. More recently, Tortosa was also on the front line between Nationalists and Republicans during the civil war and the site of an epic battle, which wrecked much of its medieval centre and cost over 35,000 lives. The town is also suffused with Jewish history that dates back to the 6th century; pick up a pamphlet in the tourist office to uncover Jewish Tortosa.
The town is a convenient base for day-trips to Miravet Castle or Gandesa’s Centre d'Estudis de la Batalla de l'Ebre.

Jardins del PríncepPARK
(adult/child €3/2; h10am-1.30pm & 4.30-7.30pm Tue-Sat, 10am-1.30pm Sun)
In the grounds of a former 19th-century spa, this carefully manicured sculpture garden is a thought-provoking and uplifting place to explore. The statues purport to illustrate the motives and destiny of humankind (a rather broad artistic theme). Nevertheless, there are plenty of intriguing sculptures, among them an eye-popping tower of nude figures.
Museu de TortosaMUSEUM
(www.museudetortosa.cat; admission €3; h10am-1.30pm & 5-8.30pm Tue-Sat, 11am-1.30pm Sun)
Within a splendid blue Modernista building, decorated with gold trim and white checkerboard designs, lies this rather minimalist town museum. The 1908 building is worth ogling: formerly a city slaughterhouse, its design has delicate Moorish elements. Within, the museum does a great job of contextualising the area's history, from traces of early Iberian settlement through to the disorder and revolution from the 18th century onwards. From October to April, the museum operates afternoon hours of 4pm to 7pm.
Castell de la SudaCASTLE, RUIN
(h24hr)F
Wandering around this 10th-century fortress is murder on your footwear: trails seem to lead nowhere, and you have to contend with steep and unfinished stairways. Despite the access issues, the castle is an enjoyable ramble, especially for the lofty views over Tortosa. Near the entrance to the adjoining parador, you'll find a small Islamic cemetery.
Catedral de Santa MariaCATHEDRAL
(Carrer Portal del Palau; adult/child €3/2; h10am-1.30pm & 4.30-7pm Mon-Sat, 11am-2pm Sun)

Hiking the Pyrenees

The Pyrenees aren’t Europe’s highest mountains, but they might just be their most formidable. The craggy behemoths stretch from the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterranean like a giant unbroken wall with barely a low-level pass to break them. Spectacular for many reasons, not least the abundance of powerful waterfalls, they act like a siren's call for hikers.
The GR11

Anyone who has spent any time hiking in the Spanish Pyrenees will likely be on first-name terms with Gran Recorrido 11 (GR11), the region’s most comprehensive long-distance footpath. It parallels the range in its entirety from Cap de Creus on the Costa Brava to Hondarribia on the Bay of Biscay. Measuring approximately 820km in length and with a cumulative elevation gain equivalent to five Mt Everests, most people sensibly elect to tackle the trail in short hops. Well-trammelled sections pass through the Valle de Ordesa near Torla and the Valle de Vallibierna close to Benasque.

Hiking Bases

The Spanish Pyrenees’ two national parks, Ordesa y Monte Perdido in Aragón and Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici in Catalonia have a particularly high concentration of good hiking trails, with accommodation available in refugios (mountain shelter, hut or refuge)or nearby villages. The former park is home to 3355m-high Monte Perdido, a tough ascent for well-equipped climbers, as well as easier hiking options such as the grunt up to the French frontier at Brecha de Rolando, or the popular Circo de Soaso, an attractive day-hike to an exuberant waterfall. If you’re super-fit, you can walk across Catalonia’s Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici in one day along the show-stopping 25km Espot–Boí (east-west traverse). You'll need several days to complete the 55km Carros de Foc (www.carrosdefoc.cat) that links all nine of the park’s refugios.
Other good hiking bases with places to stay and a nearby network of trails include the villages of Hecho and Torla in Aragon, or Taüll and Olot in Catalonia. The latter has good, family-friendly walking terrain.

Practicalities

The optimum time for walking is mid-June to early September, though the more popular parks and paths can become crowded in midsummer. The weather can be unpredictable, so walkers should always be prepared for extreme conditions. However, since this is Europe (rather than Alaska), you’re never too far from a mountain village with basic shops, bars and accommodation.
Dotted throughout the mountains are refugios. Some are staffed and serve meals, while others provide shelter only. At holiday times staffed refugios are often full, so unless you've booked ahead, be prepared to camp. The Federación Aragonesa de Montañismo (www.fam.es) in Zaragoza can provide information, and a FAM card will get you substantial discounts on refugio stays. For information on refugios in Catalonia, try the Barcelona-based Federacio Enitats Excursionistes da Catalunya (www.feec.org). Editorial Alpina (www.editorialalpina.com) produce excellent maps for walkers. For a definitive guide to the GR11, check out the recently published Cicerone Guide The GR11 Trail – La Senda by Brian Johnson (2014).

TRIP HIGHLIGHT
c Figueres
Twelve kilometres inland, Figueres is a busy town with a French feel and an unmissable attraction: Salvador Dalí. The artist was born in Figueres in 1904 and although his career took him to Madrid, Barcelona, Paris and the USA, he remained true to his roots. In the 1960s and ’70s he created here the extraordinary Teatre-Museu Dalí (www.salvador-dali.org; Plaça de Gala i Salvador Dalí 5; admission incl Dalí Joies & Museu de l’Empordà adult/child under 9yr €12/free; 9am-8pm Jul-Sep, 9.30am-6pm Tue-Sun Mar-Jun & Oct, 10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun Nov-Feb) – a monument to surrealism and a legacy that outshines any other Spanish artist, both in terms of popularity and sheer flamboyance.
This red castlelike building, topped with giant eggs and studded with plaster-covered croissants, is an entirely appropriate final resting place for the master of surrealism. ‘Theatre-museum’ is an apt label for this trip through the incredibly fertile imagination of one of the great performers of the 20th century. The inside is full of surprises, tricks and illusions, and contains a substantial portion of Dalí’s life’s work.

1 Girona
Northern Catalonia’s largest city, Girona is a tight huddle of ancient arcaded houses, grand churches and climbing cobbled streets. It’s home to Catalonia’s most extensive and best-preserved medieval Jewish quarter, all enclosed by defensive walls, with the lazy Río Onyar meandering along the edge of town. The excellent Museu d’Història dels Jueus de Girona (www.girona.cat/call; Carrer de la Força 8; adult/child €4/free; 10am-8pm Mon-Sat, to 2pm Sun) shows genuine pride in Girona’s Jewish heritage. Nearby, the stunning 800-year-old Catedral (www.catedraldegirona.org; Plaça de la Catedral; adult/student incl Basílica de Sant Feliu €7/5, Sun free; 10am-7.30pm Apr-Oct, 10am-6.30pm Nov-Mar) provides a window into medieval Christendom.

2 Vic
Vic is one of Catalonia’s gems. Its enchanting old quarter is crammed with Roman remnants, medieval leftovers, a grand Gothic cloister, an excellent art museum, some hectic markets and a glut of superb restaurants.
Plaça Major, the largest of Catalonia’s central squares, is lined with medieval, baroque and Modernista mansions. It’s still the site of the huge twice-weekly market (Tuesday and Saturday mornings). Around it swirl the narrow serpentine streets of medieval Vic, lined by mansions, churches, chapels, a Roman temple and a welcoming atmosphere.
The Museu Episcopal (www.museuepiscopalvic.com; Plaça del Bisbe Oliba 3; adult/child over 10yr €7/3.50; 10am-1pm & 3-6pm Tue-Fri, 10am-7pm Sat, 10am-2pm Sun) holds a marvellous collection of Romanesque and Gothic art, including works by key figures such as Lluís Borrassà and Jaume Huguet.

The castle – follow the signs uphill to the Parador Ducs de Cardona, a lovely place to stay overnight – was built over an older predecessor. The single-most remarkable element of the buildings is the lofty and spare Romanesque Església de Sant Vicenç.
The Drive » It’s a one-hour drive south to Montserrat. The scenic route along C55 passes over forested slopes and around the old village of Manresa (a pilgrimage site). About 20km south of there, take BP1121 and follow the signs to Centre Urbà/Montserrat.

7 Reial Monestir de Santes Creus
Cistercian monks settled here in 1168 and from then on this monastery (Plaça de Jaume el Just, Santes Creus; adult/senior & student €4.50/free; 10am-6.30pm Jun-Sep, 10am-5pm Oct-May) developed as a major centre of learning and a launch pad for the repopulation of the surrounding territory. Behind the Romanesque and Gothic facade lies a glorious 14th-century sandstone cloister, austere chapter house, cavernous dormitory and royal apartments where the count-kings often stayed when they popped by during Holy Week.
The Drive » Take TP2002 south and turn onto C51 about 7km south of Santa Creus. Stay on C51 for a few kilometres before taking N240. Fine views await as you cross the Tossal Gros mountain, part of Catalonia’s precoastal range. Exit onto TV7001 toward L’Espluga de Francolí. You’ll pass through this small town along T700 en route to the monastery.

It became Catalonia’s most powerful monastery and the burial place of many of its rulers. Poblet was sacked in 1835 by marauding peasants as payback for the monks’ abuse of their feudal powers, which included imprisonment and torture. High points include the mostly Gothic main cloister and the alabaster sculptural treasures of the Panteón de los Reyes (Kings’ Pantheon). The raised alabaster sarcophagi contain eight Catalan kings, such greats as Jaume I (the conqueror of Mallorca and Valencia) and Pere III.
The Drive » The last stop is another 30km north. You’ll take the T700 back through L’Espluga de Francolí, then hop onto the T232. You’ll take the L220 as you reach Els Omells de na Gaia. Follow this north, about another 1km, then look for the signed right turn leading to Vallbona de les Monges.

Northern Catalonia’s largest city, Girona is a jewellery box of museums, galleries and Gothic churches, strung around a web of cobbled lanes and medieval walls. Reflections of Modernista mansions shimmer in the Riu Onyar, which separates the walkable historic centre on its eastern bank from the gleaming commercial centre on the west.
The Roman town of Gerunda lay on the Via Augusta from Gades (now Cádiz) to the Pyrenees. Taken from the Muslims by the Franks in the late 8th century, Girona became the capital of one of Catalonia’s most important counties, falling under the sway of Barcelona in the late 9th century. Girona’s wealth in medieval times produced many fine Romanesque and Gothic buildings that have survived repeated attacks, while a Jewish community flourished here until its expulsion in 1492.
With Catalonia’s most diverse nightlife and dining scene outside Barcelona, Girona makes a delicious distraction from the coast.

Girona’s exquisitely preserved Call (Jewish Quarter) – a labyrinth of low-slung stone arches and slender cobbled streets – flourished around narrow Carrer de la Força for six centuries, until relentless Christian persecution forced the Jews out of Spain.

Towering over a flight of 86 steps rising from Plaça de la Catedral, Girona’s imposing cathedral is far more ancient than its billowing baroque facade suggests. Built over an old Roman forum, parts of its foundations date from the 5th century. Today, 14th-century Gothic styling – added over an 11th-century Romanesque church – dominates, though a beautiful, double-columned Romanesque cloister dates from the 12th century. With the world’s second-widest Gothic nave, it’s a formidable sight to explore, but audio guides are provided.

Until 1492, Girona was home to Catalonia’s second-most important medieval Jewish community, after Barcelona, and one of the country’s finest Jewish quarters. This excellent museum takes pride in Girona’s Jewish heritage, without shying away from less salubrious aspects such as Inquisition persecution and forced conversions. You also see a rare 11th-century miqvé (ritual bath) and a 13th-century Jewish house.

There’s much more to this entrancing museum than the silver screen. Displays examine why humanity longs to indulge its imagination, probing the origins of visual storytelling, such as Chinese and Indian shadow puppets. It’s a whistle-stop tour taking in the invention of the camera obscura, the 19th-century debut of the Lumière brothers, and optical illusions using mirrors and trickery of light, including eerie phantasmagoria. Displays are in Catalan, Spanish, English and French.

(MAP GOOGLE MAP; www.banysarabs.org; Carrer de Ferran el Catòlic; adult/child €2/1; h10am-7pm Mon-Sat, to 2pm Sun Mar-Oct, 10am-2pm Nov-Feb)
Although modelled on earlier Islamic and Roman bathhouses, the Banys Àrabs are a finely preserved, 12th-century Christian affair in Romanesque style (restored in the 13th century). The baths contain an apodyterium (changing room), with a small octagonal pool framed by slender pillars, followed by a frigidarium and tepidarium (with respectively cold and warm water) and a caldarium (a kind of sauna) heated by an underfloor furnace.

Just downhill from the cathedral stands Girona’s second great church, with its landmark truncated bell tower. The nave is majestic with Gothic ribbed vaulting, while St Narcissus, the city’s patron, is venerated in an enormous marble-and-jasper, late-baroque side chapel. To the right of the chapel is the saint’s Gothic, 1328 sepulchre (which previously held his remains), displaying his reclining form and scenes from his life including the conversion of women, martyrdom and expelling of an evil genie.

Eighteenth-century cloisters lend an appropriately antique feel to this journey from Roman Girona to medieval times to the present day. The museum’s highlights include an exhibition illuminating the 3rd- to 4th-century Can Pau Birol mosaic, which depicts a lively circus scene with charioteers, and an explanation of the 1808 to 1809 siege of Girona by Napoleonic troops. Many pieces on display are copies rather than originals. Spanish-, English- and French-language booklets help with the Catalan-only display labels.

Next to the cathedral, in the 12th- to 16th-century Palau Episcopal, this art gallery impresses with the scale and variety of its collection. Around 8500 pieces of art, mostly from this region, fill its displays, which ranges from Romanesque woodcarvings and murals to paintings of the city by 20th-century Polish-French artist Mela Mutter, early-20th-century sculptures by influential Catalan architect Rafael Masó i Valentí, and works by leading Modernista artist Santiago Rusiñol.

The first name that pops into your head when you lay eyes on this red castle-like building, topped with giant eggs and stylised Oscar-like statues and studded with plaster-covered croissants, is Salvador Dalí. An entirely appropriate final resting place for the master of surrealism, it has assured his immortality. Exhibits range from enormous, impossible-to-miss installations – like Taxi Plujós (Rainy Taxi), an early Cadillac surmounted by statues – to the more discreet, including a tiny, mysterious room with a mirrored flamingo.

This museum has more than 5000 toys from throughout the ages – from the earliest board games involving coloured stones, to intricate dolls’ houses, to 1920s dolls with baleful stares that may haunt your dreams, to choo-chooing train models, to Catalonia- and Valencia-made religious processions of tiny figures. It’s a mesmerising display, with plenty to amuse the kids, and a section devoted to Dalí’s childhood. Admission is reduced by 30% if you flash a Teatre-Museu Dalí ticket.

Figueres’ sturdy 18th-century fortress commands the surrounding plains from a low hill 1km northwest of the centre. The complex is a wonder of military engineering: it sprawls over 32 hectares, with the capacity for 6000 men to march within its walls and snooze in military barracks. Admission fees include clanking audio guides (nearly as old as the castle).
Built in the 1750s to repel French invaders, the fortress nevertheless fell to its Gallic neighbours – both in 1794 and 1808. Spain’s Republican government held its final meeting of the civil war (on 1 February, 1939) in the dungeons here.

Extending over four floors, the local museum time travels from ancient amphorae to 7th-century sculptures to rotating installations of contemporary art. The region’s culture and history are presented in a fragmented way, but it’s an enjoyable journey. The 17th-century religious art is especially worthy of attention. Don’t miss a colour-bursting 1962 Sant Narcís by Dalí.

But despite the bacchanalian nightlife, Sitges remains a classy destination: its array of galleries and museums belie its small size, there’s a good choice of upmarket restaurants in its historic centre (which is lined with chic boutiques), and the October film festival (Festival Internacional de Cinema Fantàstic de Catalunya; www.sitgesfilmfestival.com; hOct) draws culture fiends from miles around.

At the feet of the Canigou, the little town of Prades, place of exile from Franco’s Spain of cellist Pablo (Pau) Casals, served as a focus of Catalan resistance until 1975.
  Most of the region’s attractions are easily reached by public transport from Roussillon’s capital, Perpignan. The coast and foothills between it and the Spanish frontier are beautiful, especially at Collioure, though predictably crowded and in most places overdeveloped. You’ll find the finest spots in the Tech and Têt valleys which slice southwest towards the high peaks, among them the Romanesque monasteries of Serrabona, St-Michel-de-Cuixà and St-Martin-du-Canigou, the world-class modern art museum at Céret, and Mont Canigou itself, lapped by foothill orchards of peaches and cherries.

Perpignan and around
This far south, climate and geography alone would ensure a palpable Spanish influence. Moreover, a good part of PERPIGNAN’s population is of Spanish origin – refugees from the Civil War and their descendants. The southern influence is further augmented by a substantial contingent of North Africans, including both Arabs and white French settlers repatriated after Algerian independence in 1962. Given its relatively grubby appearance, few will want to stay here for more than a day or two; if you have your own transport, you may prefer to base yourself somewhere in the surrounding area.

Casa Païral
Place de Verdun • 10.30am–6pm; closed Mon & bank holidays • €2 •  04 68 35 42 05
The best place to begin explorations of Perpignan is at Le Castillet, built as a gateway in the fourteenth century and now home to the Casa Païral, an interesting museum of Roussillon’s Catalan rural culture and the anti-French rebellions of 1661–74, when the tower held captured Catalan insurgents.
Place de la Loge
A short distance from place de Verdun down rue Louis-Blanc lies place de la Loge, focus of the pedestrianized heart of the old town, with a voluptuous Venus statue by Aristide Maillol in the centre. Dominating the cafés and brasseries of the narrow square is Perpignan’s most interesting building, the Gothic Loge de Mer (1397). Designed to hold the city’s stock exchange and maritime court, it features gargoyles, lancet windows and lacy balustrades up top. Adjacent stand the sixteenth-century hôtel de ville, with its magnificent wrought-iron gates and with another Maillol (La Méditerranée) in the courtyard, and the fifteenth-century Palais de la Députation, once the parliament of Roussillon.
Cathédrale St-Jean-Baptiste
Place Gambetta • Mon–Sat 8am–6pm (closes 7pm June–Sept), Sun 2–6pm • Free • Campo Santo Oct–April Tues–Sun 11am–5pm; closed May–Sept
From place de la Loge, rue St-Jean leads northeast to the fourteenth-century Cathédrale St-Jean on place Gambetta, its external walls built of alternating bands of river stones and brick. The dimly lit interior is most interesting for its elaborate Catalan altarpieces and for the fourteenth-century, Rhenish polychrome Crucifixion known as the Dévôt Christ; it’s in the fifth side chapel along the north wall, and was probably brought from the Low Countries by a travelling merchant. Out of the side door, a few steps on the left, you’ll find the entrance to the Campo Santo, a vast enclosure that’s one of France’s oldest cemeteries, occasionally used for summer concerts.
CATALAN CUISINE
Characterized by the wide variety of ingredients that grow throughout the different climates between the mountains and the sea, Catalonia’s distinctive food depends on its use of contrasting (sweet, savoury and sour) flavours within the five fundamental sauces of Catalan cuisine. The most important of these is sofregit, a tomato-based sauce with caramelized onion that’s used ubiquitously. The most popular traditional dishes include ollada (pork stew), bullinada (similar to paella but with potatoes instead of rice) and regional favourite, Boles de Picolat (meatballs). Catalans have a sweet tooth too and produce a variety of custardy desserts like Pa d’ous (flan) and crema catalane as well as the wonderful sweet wines of Banyuls and Rivesaltes.
The Maghrebian and Romany quarters
South of the cathedral, rue de la Révolution-Française and rue de l’Anguille lead into the teeming, dilapidated Maghrebian and Romany quarter, where women congregate on the secluded inner lanes but are seldom seen on the busier thoroughfares. Here you’ll find North African shops and cafés, especially on rue Llucia, and a daily market on place Cassanyes. Uphill and north from this stands the elegant church of St-Jacques (Tues–5pm 11am–5pm; free), which was built in two phases in the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries; it abuts La Miranda gardens, atop a section of the old city walls.
Palais des Rois de Majorque
Rue Archers • Daily: June–Sept 10am–6pm; Oct–May 9am–5pm • €4 •  04 68 34 96 26
A twenty-minute walk southwest through place des Esplanades brings you to the main entrance of the Palais des Rois de Majorque, which crowns the hill that dominates the southern part of the old town. Although Vauban’s walls surround it now, and it’s suffered generally from on-going military use until 1946, the two-storey palace and its partly arcaded courtyard date originally from the late thirteenth century. There are frequent worthwhile temporary exhibits in the former king’s apartments.
Musée Hyacinthe Rigaud
16 rue de l’Ange, near place Arago • Tues–Sun 10.30am–6pm • €5 •  04 68 35 43 40
The collection at the Musée Hyacinthe Rigaud is devoted largely to Catalan painters, most notably Minorcan-born Pierre Daura (1896–1976), a Republican and godson of Pablo Casals long exiled in the US: his sympathies are evident in two symbolic canvases of the post-Civil-War Republican refugee camps at nearby Argelès. One room has a few Maillol sketches and statues, and three portraits by Picasso. Expect some disruption as the museum has just been awarded €10 million to expand to become a major “cultural destination” sometime in 2017.
Forteresse de Salses
Guided tours: April–Sept 10am–6.30pm; Oct–March 10am–12.15pm & 2–5pm • €7.50 •  salses.monuments-nationaux.fr • Trains to Salses depart from Perpignan every 30min (13min)
An interesting stop 15km north of Perpignan is the Forteresse de Salses, in the town of Salses-le-Château. This late fifteenth-century Spanish-built fort, on the north end of town, was one of the first to be designed with a ground-hugging profile to protect it from artillery fire. It housed around one thousand troops and was entirely self-sufficient with wells, irrigation systems and even a bakery within the walls. Tours are in French but afterwards you will be able to explore some parts on your own.
Tautavel
Tautavel, 25km northwest of Perpignan off the St-Paul-de-Fenouillet road, might not have much to see, but is interesting anthropologically. In 1971 the remains of the oldest known European hominid – dated to around 450,000 years old – were discovered in the nearby Caune d’Arago cave, and a reconstruction of the skull and other cave finds are displayed in the village’s Musée de la Préhistoire (daily: 10am–12.30pm & 2–6pm; July–Aug 10am–7pm; €8;  450000ans.com).

ACCOMMODATION
D’Aragon 17 av Gilbert Brutus  04 68 54 04 46,  aragon-hotel.com. A bit out of the way, but handy for the Palais des Rois de Majorque, Aragon is a two-star with simple, unfussy rooms and parking nearby. €58

Closes Dec 20 for one month. €93
EATING, DRINKING AND ENTERTAINMENT
For a city of Perpignan’s size, restaurants, bars and clubs are quite thin on the ground. However, there’s the Trobades festival celebrating the medieval heritage of the region (in late September) and other events like the October-long Jazzèbre festival. But Perpignan’s best-known spectacle is La Procession de la Sanch, the Good Friday procession of red-hooded penitents that goes from the church of St-Jacques to the cathedral between 3pm and 5pm. Nightlife is largely confined to wine/tapas bars in the narrow alleyways of the old centre while young clubbers journey to the modern coastal resort of Canet Plage at weekends.
Bio Deux Anges 39 rue des Augustins  04 68 08 78 32,  biodeuxanges.com. Organic, vegetarian restaurant with nutritionally balanced menus from €15.50 based around whole grains such as quinoa and Camargue rice. Tues–Sat 9am–7pm.

Café Vienne 3 place Arago  04 68 34 80 00. Specializing in seafood, this large nonstop pavement restaurant churns out three courses for €18 rising to €25 in the evening. The €25 “Oyster Seller’s Tray”, with all manner of tasty crustaceans is the highlight. Fri–Sat noon–midnight; Sun–Thurs noon–11pm.
Casa Sansa 2 rue Fabriques-Couvertes  04 68 50 48 01. In a smart side street, this place, with its bullfight posters and old photos on the wall, serves traditional regional dishes such as suquet-bouillabaisse, a Catalan take on the famous Marseillan fish broth. Menus start at around €17. Daily noon–2pm & 7–10.30pm.
New Bodega 3bis rue Voltaire  04 68 35 21 87,  lanew-bodega.e-monsite.com. A tapas restaurant rather than bar, with severely limited seating – booking is advisable at weekends. It’s straightforward classic tapas: patatas bravas, gambas planxa calamari and the like, with prices mostly hovering around the €5 mark, and all joyfully prepared behind the large glass screen next to the tables. Daily noon–2pm & 7–11pm.
 Le P’Ti Resto 6 rue Sainte-Magdeleine  09 54 38 53 58. A restaurant for more adventurous carnivores, this is the place to try tartare. Every dish is vibrant, with accompaniments chosen as much for their colour as their contrasting tastes: try the lobster tartare served with a roast onion and broad bean salad and lobster jus. Menus from €16. Noon–2pm & 7–11pm except all Sun and Mon lunch.
 La Table 5 rue de la Poissonnerie  09 53 17 03 01. Perpignan’s gourmet choice delivers beautifully presented plates (and slates) in atmospheric surroundings.

Mon 7–10pm, Tues & Wed noon–2pm & 7–10pm, Thurs noon–2pm & 7–10.30pm, Fri & Sat noon–2pm & 7–11.30pm.
Castlenou
Twenty kilometres southwest of Perpignan, beyond the winemaking town of Thuir, is CASTELNOU, one of the best-preserved villages in the Pyrenees. Surrounded by rolling hills of sun-baked scrub and oak, there’s little sign of modernization for miles around, save for the road to the village. Through the pedestrianized fourteenth-century portal, the village rambles up towards the pentagon-shaped Château de Castelnou (Oct–April Sat–Wed 11am–5pm; May–Sept daily 10am–7pm; €5.50;  04 68 53 22 91,  chateaudecastelnou.fr) – a worthwhile ascent for the views alone. First inhabited in 990 AD, the château served as the military and administrative capital to the Viscount of Vallespir until 1321. Despite its elevated position, it was besieged several times, notably by the kings of Majorca and Aragón in 1285 and 1295. There’s a car park at the base of the village or up the hill behind the castle.
ACCOMMODATION AND EATING: CASTELNOU
 Chambre d’hôte/Crêperie la Figuera 3 Carrer de la Fond D’Avall   04 68 53 18 42,  la-figuera.com. In a truly idyllic spot at the base of the village with a gorgeous terrace cloaked with plants and flowers, and tables beneath rambling fig trees. The restaurant produces simple Catalan dishes and galettes from €8 or you can just stop by for a quick drink (Easter–Sept noon–2pm & 7–9pm; nonstop service at busier times). €75

The Côte Vermeille
The Côte Vermeille, where the Pyrenees meet the sea, is the last patch of French shoreline before Spain, its seaside villages once so remote that the Fauvist painters of the early 1900s hid out here. Mass tourism may have ended any sense of exclusivity but outside of high season there is solitude and peace among the wide empty beaches; interspersed between modern resorts like Port-Barcarès (north east of Perpignan), Canet Plage and Argèles-sur-Mer. The coastline remains sandy and straight almost until the border before being pushed east by the upsurging Pyrenean chain, where the prettier cove towns of Collioure and Banyuls are found.
Collioure
Some thirty kilometres southeast of Perpignan, COLLIOURE is achingly picturesque. Palm trees line the curving main beach of Port d’Avall, while slopes of vines and olives rise to ridges crowned with ruined forts and watchtowers. Its setting and monuments inspired Henri Matisse and André Derain to embark in 1905 on their explosive Fauvist colour experiments.
  Collioure is dominated by its twelfth-century Château-Royal (daily: 9am–5pm; July & Aug 10am–7pm; €4;  04 68 82 06 43), founded by the Templars and subject to later alterations by the kings of Mallorca and Aragón, and again after the Treaty of the Pyrenees gave Collioure to France. The mediocre permanent “collection” inside scarcely merits the entrance fee; attend instead a concert in the courtyard.
  The second landmark in the town is the Église Notre-Dame-des-Anges (daily: 9am–noon & 2–6pm; free;   04 68 82 06 43), which features in every postcard and tourist brochure of the region. With its belfry dating back to the middle ages, this building served as a beacon for the port until the late seventeenth century when the rest of the church was adjoined. Behind it two small beaches are divided by a causeway leading to the chapel of St-Vincent, built on a former islet, while west from here a concrete path follows the rocky shore to the bay of Le Racou.
  Just north of the château lies the old harbour, still home to a handful of brightly painted lateen-rigged fishing boats – now more likely used as pleasure craft – all that remains of Collioure’s traditional fleet. Beyond this, the stone houses and sloping lanes of the old Mouré quarter are the main focus of interest.
INFORMATION: COLLIOURE
Tourist office Place de 18-Juin (April–June & Sept 9am–noon & 2–7pm; July & Aug Mon–Sat 9am–8pm & Sun 10am–6pm; Oct–March Mon–Sat 9am–noon & 2–6pm;  04 68 82 15 47,  collioure.com).
ACCOMMODATION
 L’Arapede Rte de Port-Vendres  04 68 98 09 59,  arapede.com. This spacious, modern hotel fifteen minutes’ walk away from the centre of the town has ample parking (drivers should note that Collioure can be a parking nightmare) and a beautiful clifftop garden patio with pool. There’s also a mini beach five minutes away. Half-board is available for an extra €32pp. Closed mid-Nov to mid-Feb. €90
Caranques Rte de Port-Vendres  04 68 82 06 68,  les-caranques.com. With the best view in town, this clifftop hotel looks down to the sea and Collioure. There’s a private staircase down the cliffside to an area suitable for swimming. The rooms are slightly basic for the level of the hotel but the balcony outlook compensates. Breakfast €13. Closed Nov–March. €150
La Girelle Plage d’Ouille  04 68 81 25 56,  campinglagirelle.unblog.fr. Enviably positioned next to a nice little sandy beach, this mostly tent-only site, ten minutes’ walk from Collioure, offers a decent range of services including a snack-bar restaurant, grocery and fridge lockers.

Hostellerie des Templiers 12 av Camille-Pelletan  04 68 98 31 10,  hotel-templiers.com. The most central place to stay, this atmospheric hotel celebrates Collioure’s art heritage (Picasso frequented the bar downstairs) with paintings screening the bar and corridor walls. The hotel itself rambles into an annex that backs on to an occasionally noisy nightclub. Closed mid-Nov to Jan. €70
EATING
Le 5eme Péché 18 rue Fraternité  04 68 98 09 76,  le-cinquieme-peche.com. Collioure’s most innovative restaurant, and perhaps the only place in France creating Japanese-French fusion. Expect colourful platters combining the uncommon bedfellows of fruit and fish to the delight of any adventurous palate. Two-course menus cost €19. 12.15–1.45pm & 7.30–9pm; closed Sun & Wed eve plus all Mon.
Paco 18 rue Rière  04 68 82 90 91. There are a few tapas options in town but this is easily the best. Open year-round, there’s a convivial atmosphere that spills onto the narrow lane as locals and tourists effortlessly mingle with one another over generous platters of calamari, razor clams and cured hams. Tapas range from €3.50 to €7.50. 11am–3pm & 5.30pm–12.30am; closed Tues.
Banyuls-sur-Mer
South towards BANYULS-SUR-MER, 10km from Collioure, both the main highway and minor D914 wind through attractive vineyards, with the Albères hills rising steeply on the right. Make sure you sample the dark, full-bodied Banyuls dessert wine, an appellation that applies only to the vineyards of the Côte Vermeille. The town itself, facing a broad sweep of pebble beach, is pleasant but lacks the overt charm of Collioure.
  On the seafront avenue du Fontaulé, the Biodiversarium (April–June & Sept Wed–Sun 2–6pm; July–Aug 9.30am–12.30pm & 2–6pm; €5;  04 68 88 73 39,   biodiversarium.fr) aquarium, run by Sorbonne university’s marine biology department, has tanks containing a comprehensive collection of the region’s submarine life; this is protected in a nearby réserve marine, France’s best, which can be explored with local scuba outfitters.
  Four kilometres southwest of town in the Vallée de Roume, signposted from the top of avenue de Gaulle, is the Musée Maillol (temporarily closed for renovation;  04 68 88 57 11,  museemaillol.com), which is devoted to the works of sculptor Aristide Maillol (1861–1944), who was born near Banyuls. He is buried under his statue La Pensée in Banyuls.
INFORMATION: BANYULS-SUR-MER
Tourist office Diagonally opposite the mairie on the seafront (July & Aug 9am–7pm; Sept–June Mon–Sat 9am–noon & 2–6pm;  04 68 88 31 58,  banyuls-sur-mer.com).
ACCOMMODATION & EATING
Les Elmes At the eponymous sandy cove 1.5km north of town  04 58 88 03 12,  hotel-des-elmes.com or   restaurant-la-littorine.fr. Slap bang on the beachfront, this hotel has excellent facilities including a hot tub, sauna, terrace and an in-house restaurant (La Littorine) downstairs. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped but aim for the sea-view ones instead of the road outlook if you can afford extra. If you dine here, it may be a bit pricey, but you’re in for a treat; €32 buys you the three perfectly balanced, elegant-looking dishes from the gourmet menu. €88
Le Fanal Av de Fontaulé  04 68 98 65 88,  pascal-borrell.com. Classic French cuisine served alfresco on tables overlooking the marina. The service can be a little slow but it’s well worth the wait. The two course €19 menu might include a very fresh catch of the day and a mouthwatering chocolate millefeuille. Daily noon–2pm & 7–10pm; closed Sun, Mon & Wed eve.
Les Pieds dans l’Eau Rue des Elmes  06 27 34 81 66,  locations-vacances-banyuls.ch. A self-catering apartment complex ideal for couples and families. Right on the sandy beach and just far enough away from the main road, it’s an extremely relaxing spot. In high season there is a minimum stay period of one week. €500 per week
Vallée de Tech
The D115 winds its way through the beautiful Vallée de Tech starting at the border town, Le Boulou, then westwards through pretty little Céret, capital of the Vallespir region. Further upstream, the road passes through the dilapidated spa town, Amélie-les-Bains, and scruffy Arles-sur-Tech, whose only attraction is the sumptuous Abbaye de Ste-Marie. Just past Arles, the narrow Gorges de la Fou is well worth an outing, before you continue west to the captivating medieval walled town of Prats-de-Mollo, which is guarded by a menacing Vauban fortification.
GETTING AROUND: VALLÉE DE TECH
By bus Destinations to and from Perpignan along the Tech valley include Amélie-les-Bains (10 daily; 55min); Arles-sur-Tech (10 daily; 1hr); Céret (15 daily; 40min); and Prats-de-Mollo (2–3 daily; 1hr 40min).
Céret
Céret is a delightful place, with a wonderfully shady old town overhung by huge plane trees; the central streets are narrow and winding, opening onto small squares like plaça de Nou Reigs (“Nine Spouts” in Catalan), named after its central fountain; on avenue d’Espagne, two remnants of the medieval walls, the Porte de France and Porte d’Espagne, are visible. The town’s main sight, however, is the remarkable Musée d’Art Moderne (July to mid Sept 10am–7pm; mid-Sept to June 10am–6pm; mid-Oct to April closed Tues; €8;  04 68 87 27 76,  musee-ceret.com) at 8 bd Maréchal Joffre. Between about 1910 and 1935, Céret’s charms – coupled with the residence here of the Catalan artist and sculptor Manolo – drew a number of avant-garde artists to the town, including Matisse and Picasso, who personally dedicated a number of pictures to the museum. The holdings are too extensive to mount everything at once, but there are works on show by Chagall, Miró, Pignon, Picasso and Dufy, among others.
INFORMATION: CÉRET
Tourist office 1 av Clemenceau (June–Aug Mon–Sat 9am–1pm & 1.30–7pm, Sun 9am–1pm; Sept–May Mon–Sat 9am–12.30pm & 2–5pm;   04 68 87 00 53,  ceret.fr).
ACCOMMODATION & EATING
Restaurant La Fontaine Plaça de Nou Reigs  04 68 87 23 47. Few could resist dining in this beautiful, traffic-free marbled square shaded by vast plane trees. If you have a family, this is the perfect place for a relaxing meal while the kids dip hands in and out of the marbled fountain. The plat du jour costs €10. Noon–2.30pm & 7–10pm; closed Tues.
 Vidal 4 place Soutine  04 68 87 00 85,  hotelceret.com. A tastefully converted eighteenth-century episcopal palace within the old town walls, Vidal is now a charming and unpretentious hotel that has a decent restaurant, Del Bisbe, attached. Its first-floor terraced restaurant, shaded by vines, serves tasty, if not ground-breaking, regional dishes including lamb roasted with pistachios. The three-course menu costs €28. Noon–2pm & 7.30–9.30pm; closed Tues & Wed. Hotel and restaurant closed Nov. €50
Abbaye de Ste-Marie
Arles-sur-Tech • July & Aug 9am–7pm; Sept–June Mon–Sat 9am–noon & 2–6pm; also Sun April–Oct 2–5pm • €4 •  04 68 83 90 66
The Romanesque Abbaye de Ste-Marie, in Arles-sur-Tech, 14km from Céret, has Carolingian origins, thought to account for the back-to-front alignment of the altar at the west end and entrance at the east. Entry is via the pleasant thirteenth-century cloister. The unique and compelling feature of the massive church interior is a band of still vividly coloured twelfth-century frescoes high up in the apse of the eastern anti-chapel dedicated to St-Michel and which, appropriately, feature the archangel.
Gorges de la Fou
April–Nov daily 10am–6pm • €9.50 •  04 68 39 16 21
The world’s narrowest canyon, the Gorges de la Fou, spans a spectacular 2km cut through the southeastern flank of Pic du Canigou; at some parts the walls are only one metre apart. Aided by a metal catwalk, the ascent through the gorge is not overly arduous.
Prats-de-Mollo
Beyond the Gorges de la Fou, the D115 climbs steadily, between valley sides thick with walnut, oak and sweet chestnut, 19km to PRATS-DE-MOLLO, the end of the bus line. Prats is the last French town before the Spanish frontier, 13km beyond at Col d’Ares, but it has none of the usual malaise of border towns and is the most attractive place in the valley since Céret. Hub of the newer quarter is El Firal, the huge square used for markets since 1308 (it takes place on Fridays); the walled and gated ville haute just south makes for a wonderful wander, with its steep cobbled streets and a weathered church that has marvellous ironwork on the door. The old town’s walls were rebuilt in the seventeenth century after the suppression of a local revolt against onerous taxation imposed by Louis XIV on his new, post-Treaty Pyrenees holdings.
  Vauban’s fortress, the Fort Lagarde (guided visits: April–June & Sept–Oct Tues–Sun 2–6pm; July & Aug daily 10.30am–1pm, 3.30pm & 5–6.30pm; €3.50;  04 68 39 70 83; enquire about guided tours at the tourist office) sits on the heights above the town. It was built in 1677 as much to intimidate the local population as to keep the Spanish out.

Tourist office Place le Fioral (April–Oct 9am–6pm; Nov–March Mon–Fri 10am–5pm;  04 68 39 70 83,  pratsdemollolapreste.com).
ACCOMMODATION AND EATING
Le Bellevue Rue el Firal  04 68 39 72 48,  hotel-le-bellevue.fr. Overlooking the place/Friday market, just outside the town wall, this appealing hotel offers private parking and rooms with balconies for a little extra. Its restaurant has seasonal menus from €20. Closed Dec to mid-Feb. €56
Hostellerie Le Relais 3 place Josep de la Trinxeria   04 68 39 71 30,  hotelrestaurantlerelais.com. Cheerful pastel-hued rooms and a south-facing garden restaurant serving an exciting range to suit all budgets including paella and Catalan meatballs, with two-course menus starting from €11. €51

Saint Marsal and around
The only direct route between the valleys of the Tech and the Têt, best covered by car or cycle, is the D618 from Amélie-les-Bains to Bouleternère. It’s 44 slow kilometres of mountain road, twisting through hillside meadows and magnificent oak forests, past isolated masies (Catalan farmsteads). Halfway there is the tiny village of Saint Marsal, which offers the first amenities en route and is well worth the stop.
Prieuré de Serrabona
Daily except major holidays 10am–6pm • €4 •  04 68 84 09 30
On the D84 just past Boule d’Amont, you’ll come across one of the finest examples – arguably the finest – of Roussillon Romanesque. The interior of the Prieuré de Serrabona (consecrated 1151) is starkly plain, making the beautifully carved column capitals of its rib-vaulted tribune even more striking: lions, centaurs, griffins and human figures with Asiatic faces and hairstyles – motifs brought back from the Crusades – executed in pink marble from Villefranche-de-Conflent, by students of the Maître d’Cabestany, if not himself.
The Têt valley
The upper Têt valley, known as the Pays de Conflent, is utterly dominated by the Pic du Canigou. The valley bottoms are lush with fields and orchards, but the vast and uncompromising mountain presides over all. As you continue upstream, the valley steepens and buckles as magnificent gorges carve in from the surrounding mountains and scalding water bleeds from the valley’s northern flank. Ancient shepherd villages, basking in Mediterranean glow, peer down on the road below. Crisscrossing the Têt, the vintage Train Jaune groans its way towards the Cerdagne plateau.
Prades (Prada) and around
The chief valley town is Prades, easily accessible by train and bus on the Perpignan–Villefranche–Latour-de-Carol route, and one obvious starting point for all excursions in the Canigou region. Although there are no great sights beyond the church of St-Pierre (free entry) in central place de la République, the town enjoys a status disproportionate to its size. This is largely thanks to Catalan cellist Pablo (Pau) Casals, who was a fierce opponent of the Franco regime in Spain, and consequently settled here as an exile. In 1950 he instituted the internationally renowned chamber music festival ( prades-festival-casals.com), held annually from late July to mid-August, the usual venue being the abbey of St-Michel-de-Cuixà.
  The thriving Tuesday morning market is not to be missed, with its produce strongly influenced by Catalan and north African culture; you’ll find paella, churros and fresh Moroccan spices, traded to the sounds of accordion buskers and congregations of elderly men chatting in French-Catalan dialect.
Abbaye St-Michel-de-Cuxà
May–Sept daily 9.30–11.50am & 2–6pm; Oct–April Mon–Sat 9.30–11.50am & 2–5pm • €5 •  04 68 96 15 35,  abbaye-cuxa.com
Three kilometres south of Prades stands one of the loveliest abbeys in France, the eleventh-century St-Michel-de-Cuxà. Although mutilated after the Revolution it is still beautiful, with its crenelated tower silhouetted against the wooded – sometimes snowy – slopes of Canigou. You enter via the labyrinthine, vaulted crypt, with its round central chamber, before proceeding to the church with its strange Visigothic-style “keyhole” arches. But the glory of the place is the cloister and its twelfth-century column capitals.
ARRIVAL AND INFORMATION: PRADES AND AROUND
By bus The bus depot is on av du Général-de-Gaulle on the east side of town.
Destinations Latour-de-Carol (2–3 daily; 1hr); Perpignan (approx. every half-hour; 55min).
By train The gare is two blocks south of the bus depot on bd de la Gare.
Destinations Perpignan (8 daily; 45min); Villefranche (8 daily; 10min).
Tourist office 10 place de la République (mid-Sept to mid-June Mon–Sat 9am–noon & 2–6pm; mid-June to mid-Sept 9am–6pm;   04 68 05 41 02,  prades-tourisme.fr).
ACCOMMODATION
 Castell Rose Chemin de la Litera  04 68 96 07 57,  castellrose-prades.com. Sumptuous chambres d’hôtes in a converted manor house with a pool and tennis court. Although just a short walk from the centre of Prades, it’s a very peaceful and secluded spot, thanks to the extensive grounds and the glorious views south to the Massif du Canigou. This outlook is also enjoyed from the homely bedrooms, particularly the ones with private balconies. €99
Chambre d’hôte Maison Prades 51 av du Général-de-Gaulle  04 68 05 74 27,  maisonprades.com. With its big bright rooms looking up to the Pic du Canigou and down to the sunny garden, this chambre d’hôte looks after its guests well. Breakfasts (included) are copious, delicious and healthy. €70
Le Grand Hôtel Molitg-les-Bains, 6km north of Prades  04 68 05 00 50,  grandhotelmolitg.com. If money is no object and you have transport, then this old and charmingly dishevelled spa hotel, beautifully set in a secluded valley next to a river, is a fine choice. Bathe in the hotel’s thermal waters, or more appealingly, the gentle flowing river below. The hotel’s gourmet restaurant has high standards and fairly high prices; a two-course meal costs €27. €115
L’Oasis Molitg-les-Bains, 6km north of Prades  04 68 05 00 92,  l-oasis-molitg-les-bains.fr. More down-to-earth than Le Grand Hôtel across the road, this budget option offers exceptional value with its basic, but clean rooms. €46
EATING
A number of appealing pavement café-restaurants ring the central place and while they offer a pleasant place to stop for a kir or two the food tends to be of poor quality.
 Restaurant Le Galie 3 av du Général-de-Gaulle  04 68 05 53 76,  gvillago.ovhsitebuilder.com. With its bold, flavourful and typically colourful Catalan-inspired dishes, you’ll forgive this small restaurant’s rather sombre atmosphere. For a light lunch, try the exquisite goat’s cheese and fig millefeuille or the prawn tempura, leaving room for their home-made éclair Paris. Menus start at €18 for two courses. Noon–3pm & 7.30–9.30pm; closed Tues eve plus all Mon & Wed.
Eus
The village of Eus, a five-minute drive northeast of Prades, claims to be the sunniest in France; it’s certainly one of the prettiest. Built among massive granite boulders that litter these elevated slopes, narrow cobbled lanes wind up to the ruined château and imposing eighteenth-century church of St Vincent. A number of easy hikes begin from the entrance to the village through the olive groves and gnarled green oak forests.
DRINKING
Des Gouts et des Couleurs Place de la Républic  06 09 53 32 47. No visit to Eus would be complete without visiting this convivial pavement bar occupying its own little place. Opening hours approximately mid-March to mid-Nov daily 11am–7pm.
Villefranche-de-Conflent
Some six kilometres up the Têt from Prades, the medieval garrison town of Villefranche-de-Conflent is dwarfed by sheer limestone escarpments, and is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful in France. Founded in 1092 by the counts of Cerdagne to block incursions from rivals in Roussillon, then remodelled by Vauban in the seventeenth century after annexation by France, its streets and fortifications have remained untouched by subsequent events. Worth a visit is St-Jacques church, with its primitively carved thirteenth-century baptismal font just inside the door; you can also walk the walls for €6 when the tourist office is open.
PETIT TRAIN JAUNE
One of the most spectacular train rides in the world, the Petit Train Jaune runs between Villefranche-de-Conflent and La Tour-de-Carol (with onward links towards Toulouse or Barcelona) in the upper Cerdagne, and is a wonder of early twentieth-century engineering. Built to link up the villages of the high Pyrenees with Perpignan, the antique narrow-gauge carriages now mostly carry tourists, cyclists and skiers. The most spectacular section of the route is in the upper Têt between Olette and Mont-Louis, where you’ll trundle over gorges and massive viaducts. The summertime frequency of the trains makes it practical to hop off and on, allowing you to explore the areas around smaller, isolated stations, many of them haltes facultatifs (ask to be set down). Outside summer, the timetable is somewhat unreliable, as the ageing train system needs regular maintenance.
Château-Fort Libéria
Daily: 10am–6pm; May & June 10am–7pm; July–Aug 9am–8pm • €10 or €7 if you fancy walking up •  fort-liberia.com
In 1681, Vauban constructed the Château-Fort Libéria on the heights above Villefranche-de-Conflent to protect it from “aerial” bombardment. Getting there involves taking the jeep, which leaves from near the town’s main gate; you can return to Villefranche by descending a subterranean stairway of a thousand steps, emerging at the end of rue St-Pierre.
St-Martin-du-Canigou
A 30min walk (no car access) above the hamlet of Casteil, itself eight kilometres south of Villefranche in the Vallée de Cady. French guided tours: Mon–Sat 10am, 11am, 2pm, 3pm, 4pm; plus June–Sept noon & 5pm; Sun/hols 10am & 12.30pm; closed Jan & Mon Oct–May • €6 •  stmartinducanigou.org
The stunning abbey of St-Martin-du-Canigou, founded in 1001, resurrected from ruins between 1902 and 1982, and now inhabited by a working religious community, occupies a narrow promontory of rock surrounded by chestnut and oak woods, while above it rises the precipitous slopes of the Pic du Canigou. Below, the ground drops vertically into the ravine of the Cady stream rushing down from the Col de Jou. What you see is a beautiful little garden and cloister overlooking the ravine, a low-ceiling, atmospheric chapel beneath the church, and the main church itself.
INFORMATION: VILLEFRANCHE-DE-CONFLENT
Tourist office 2 rue St Jean, by the western gate (Feb, Oct & Nov 10.30am–noon & 2–5pm; March–May 10.30am–5pm; June & Sept 10am–7pm; July & Aug 10am–8pm; Dec 2–5pm; closed Jan;  04 68 96 22 96,  villefranchedeconflent-tourisme.fr).
ACCOMMODATION
À l’Ombre du Fort 2 Sainte-Eulalie  04 68 97 10 01,  activityholidayfrance.com. A grand nineteenth-century house cloaked in Virginia creeper with spacious rooms and parquet flooring. Outside there’s a large, landscaped garden and sun-drenched swimming pool secluded by trees. Min stay 2 nights. Breakfast included. €85
Camping Les Cerisiers Chemin de la Pena, Vernet-les-Bains (6km south of Villefranche)  04 68 05 60 38,  camping-lescerisiers.com. Unlike other campsites in the area, this pleasant little site is peacefully tucked away from any kind of main road. It’s also well located for attempts to summit the Pic du Canigou. There are a few facilities here: sauna, hot tub, free wi-fi and little shop, while Vernet covers all other needs. Mid-March to mid-Oct. €20
EATING
 Boulangerie Patisserie Miras 13 rue Saint Jacques  04 68 96 37 06,  boulangerie.miras.free.fr. Run by a genuine artisan boulanger, this is the ideal place to sample the Bunyete, a Catalan speciality akin to a pancake-doughnut-cross (€2.50). This attractive little shop proudly bakes its breads and pastries in a 1930s cast iron, wood-fired oven. Tues–Sun 7am–1pm & 2–7pm; July & Aug daily 6.30am–8.30pm.
La Senyera 81 rue Saint Jean  04 68 96 17 65,  lasenyera.fr. This beautiful and atmospheric restaurant has the best reputation in town and is where the locals choose to dine. Dishes like the millefeuille de thon display a refreshingly sophisticated flair for a touristic hub like Villefranche, although there are a few gimmicks such as slates acting as plates. Budget around €20–30 for a generous meal. Noon–2pm & 7.30–9pm; Nov–March closed Wed lunch & eves except Sat eve; April–Oct closed Tues–Thurs eve; closed mid-Oct to mid-Nov & first week of July.
The upper Têt
Ten or so kilometres west of Villefranche, the mountains close in, dwarfing the valley and road below. As you turn right just past the village of Olette the road leads to the picture-perfect shepherd’s village of Evol, overlooked by the old fortress of the So Viscounts. Further up the Têt, most of the settlements are high on the mountainside, connected by ancient footpaths and dry-stone terraces, the most breathtaking of which is Canaveilles; from the main road it’s three kilometres of vertiginous single-track hairpins to reach this characterful old village. If you cross the main N166 road from the foot of Canaveilles and follow the well-trodden path to the river, you’ll see a stone basin with scalding thermal water pouring in from the mountainside with a makeshift sluice gate in the river for temperature adjustment. Some 3km further on the south side of the valley, the wild, wooded Gorges de la Carança (Thuès-Entre-Valls is the nearest village) cuts south through the mountains towards Spain.
  One trip worth making, particularly after a heavy day’s trekking, is to Les Bains de St-Thomas (daily 10am–7.40pm; July & Aug last admission 8.40pm; closed early June & Nov; €6.50;  04 68 97 03 13,  bains-saint-thomas.fr). Signposted from Fontpedrouse, 11km west of Olette, there are three open-air thermal pools here set at a pleasant 36–38°C, and located in a beautiful pine forest.
ACCOMMODATION AND EATING: UPPER TET VALLEY
There is a real dearth of accommodation options in this well-touristed area, except for holiday homes that usually rent by the week. Crucially there are no restaurants here either; the nearest are either back in Villefranche or up in Mont Louis.
La Fontaine In the centre of Olette  04 68 97 03 67,  atasteofcatalonia.co.uk. An excellent, English-run chambre d’hôte with five very tasteful rooms including a family suite. Breakfast is provided here but for all other meals in this town there is only a café across the road selling sandwiches. Closed Jan. €58
The Cerdagne
Twenty kilometres up from Olette, the Mediterranean climate slips away as the gradient flattens onto the wide, grassy Cerdagne plateau, whose once-powerful counts controlled lands from Barcelona to Roussillon. It’s a region that’s never been sure whether it is Spanish or French. After the French annexation of Roussillon, it was partitioned, with Spain retaining – as it still does – the enclave of Lliva. The Petit Train Jaune snakes laboriously across the entire plateau, though stations aren’t always convenient for the settlements they nominally serve.
Mont Louis
Easterly gateway to the region, the little garrison town of Mont Louis, built by Vauban in 1679–82, is France’s highest fortified town. The top citadelle is still a training school for paratroops and marines. Today the town is an attractive halfway station between the Mediterranean and Andorra, and has a few shops, bars and restaurants.
ACCOMMODATION AND EATING: MONT LOUIS
Chambre d’hôte La Volute 1 place d’Armes  06 21 58 01 80,  lavolute.wix.com/lavolute. Set in the seventeenth-century former governor’s mansion, with a garden atop a section of the ramparts overlooking the moat and mountains beyond. Minimum stay of one week outside of low season €110
Le Rucher de l’Ours 6 bd Vauban  04 68 04 11 26,  miel-lerucherdelours.fr. Welcoming little crêperie serving three courses for €16 under a stone-vaulted roof or outside in the often chilly wind. The restaurant is owned by a fantastic honey producer so be sure to stock up from the vast array of bee-related produce also sold here. Wed–Sun noon–2.30pm & 7–9pm; daily, with extended opening hours during school holidays.
Les Lacs des Bouillouses
The Têt ultimately has its source in the Carlit massif, which looms above the lovely Lacs des Bouillouses. This huge park in the high Pyrenees is strikingly beautiful; the sky is a different, purer kind of blue and the river and lake waters are clear and fresh. There are moderately difficult, circular hikes around the lakes that feed into the main reservoir as well as idyllic picnic beaches along the banks of the gentle river. Wild swimming in the summer months is a more than appealing prospect. To get here, turn north from Mont Louis and from there it’s well signposted.

Abbey de Fontfroide
Fontfroide, 15km southwest of Narbonne • Guided tours daily: April–June & Sept 10am–12.15pm & 1.45pm–5.30pm; July & Aug 10am–6pm; Oct 10am–12.15pm & 1.45–4.45pm; Nov–March 10am–noon & 2–4pm • €10.80 •  04 68 45 11 08,  fontfroide.com
A good side trip from Narbonne – just 15km southwest, but impossible without transport of your own – is the lovely Abbey de Fontfroide, which enjoys a beautiful location tucked into a fold in the dry cypress-clad hillsides. The extant buildings go back to the twelfth century, with some elegant seventeenth-century additions in the entrance and courtyards, and were in use from their foundation until 1900, first by Benedictines, then Cistercians. It was one of the Cistercian monks, Pierre de Castelnau, whose murder as papal legate sparked the notorious Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in 1208.
  Visits to the restored abbey are only possible on a guided tour. Star features include the cloister, with its marble pillars and giant wisteria creepers, the church itself, some fine ironwork and a rose garden. The stained glass in the windows of the lay brothers’ dormitory consists of fragments from churches in north and eastern France damaged in World War I.


Carcassonne
Right on the main Toulouse–Montpellier train link, CARCASSONNE couldn’t be easier to reach. For anyone travelling through this region it is a must – one of the most dramatic, if also most-visited, towns in the whole of Languedoc. Carcassonne owes its division into two separate “towns” to the wars against the Cathars. Following Simon de Montfort’s capture of the town in 1209, its people tried in 1240 to restore their traditional ruling family, the Trencavels. In reprisal, King Louis IX expelled them from the Cité, only permitting their return on the condition that they built on the low ground by the River Aude – what would become the ville basse.
  A major summertime event worth catching is the Festival de Carcassonne from late June to mid-August, featuring world-class dance, theatre and music. The high point is the mammoth fireworks display on Bastille Day (July 14).

THE CANAL DU MIDI
The Canal du Midi runs for 240km from the River Garonne at Toulouse via Carcassonne to the Mediterranean at Agde. It was the brainchild of Pierre-Paul Riquet, a minor noble and tax collector, who succeeded in convincing Louis XIV (and more importantly, his first minister, Colbert) of the merits of linking the Atlantic and the Mediterranean via the Garonne.
  The work, begun in 1667, took fourteen years to complete, using tens of thousands of workers. The crux of the problem from the engineering point of view was how to feed the canal with water when its high point at Naurouze, west of Carcassonne, was 190m above sea level and 58m above the Garonne at Toulouse. Riquet responded by building a system of reservoirs in the Montagne Noire, channelling run-off from the heights down to Naurouze. He spent the whole of his fortune on the canal and, sadly, died just six months before its inauguration in 1681.
  The canal was a success and sparked a wave of prosperity along its course, with traffic increasing steadily until 1857, when the Sète–Bordeaux railway was opened, reducing trade on the canal to all but nothing. Today, the canal remains a marvel of engineering and beauty, incorporating no fewer than 99 locks (écluses) and 130 bridges, almost all of which date back to the first era of construction. The canal has, since its construction, been known for the lovely plane trees that line riverbank. Sadly, a wilt infection was discovered in 2006 and since then the trees have been systematically cut down. They will be replaced, however the view will not be the same for many years to come. You can follow the canal by road, and many sections have foot or bicycle paths, but the best way to see it is, of course, by boat. Outfits in all the major ports rent houseboats and barges, and there are many cruise options to choose from as well. Other sources of information include  canalmidi.com and   french-waterways.com, plus the tourist offices in Carcassonne and Toulouse.
Boat rental and cruises Le Boat ( 1 800 734 5491,  leboat.com or Locaboat (  03 86 91 72 72,   locaboat.com), both have a number of branches in Languedoc and the Midi.
Information Voies Navigables de France, 2 Port St-Étienne in Toulouse ( 05 61 36 24 24,  sudouest.vnf.fr); they also have English-speaking offices at the major canal ports.
Cité
To reach the Cité from the ville basse, take bus #2 from outside the station, or a navette from Square Gambetta. Alternatively, walk it in less than 30min, crossing the Pont-Vieux and climbing rue Barbacane, past the church of St-Gimer to the sturdy bastion of the Porte d’Aude (this is effectively the back entrance – the main gate is Porte Narbonnaise, on the east side)
The attractions of the well-preserved and lively ville basse notwithstanding, everybody comes to Carcassonne to see the Cité, the double-walled and turreted fortress that crowns the hill above the River Aude. From a distance it’s the epitome of the fairy-tale medieval town. Viollet-le-Duc rescued it from ruin in 1844, and his “too-perfect” restoration has been furiously debated ever since. It is, as you would expect, a real tourist trap. Yet, in spite of the chintzy cafés, craft shops and the crowds, you’d have to be a very stiff-necked purist not to be moved at all.

Château Comtal
1 rue Viollet-le-Duc • Daily: April–Sept 9.30am–6.30pm; Oct–March 9.30am–5pm; guided tours only, several in English • €8.50 •  04 68 11 70 70,  carcassonne.monuments-nationaux.fr
There is no charge for admission to the streets or the grassy lices – “lists” – between the walls, though cars are banned from 10am to 6pm. However, to see the inner fortress of the Château Comtal and walk the walls, you’ll have to join a guided tour. These assume some knowledge of French history, and point out the various phases in the construction of the fortifications, from Roman and Visigothic to Romanesque and the post-Cathar adaptations of the French kings.
St-Nazaire
Place St-Nazaire • Mon–Fri 8.45am–12.45pm & 1.45–5/6pm, Sat & Sun 8.45–10.30am & 2–5/6pm • Free •   04 68 10 24 30 •  carcassonne.org
Don’t miss the beautiful church of St-Nazaire, towards the southern corner of the Cité at the end of rue St-Louis. It’s a serene combination of nave with carved capitals in the Romanesque style and a Gothic choir and transepts, along with some of the loveliest stained glass in Languedoc. In the south transept is a tombstone believed to belong to Simon de Montfort. You can also climb the tower for spectacular views over the Cité.
ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE: CARCASSONNE
By plane Carcassonne airport lies just west of the city ( 04 68 71 96 46,  aeroport-carcassonne.com). A navette (€5; hourly; 15min) leaves from outside the terminal and stops at the gare SNCF, square Gambetta and the Cité; a taxi to the centre will cost €8–15.
By train The gare SNCF is in the ville basse on the north bank of the Canal du Midi at the northern limits of the old town.
Destinations Arles (4–8 daily; 2hr 40min–3hr 30min); Béziers (22 daily; 45min–1hr 45min); Bordeaux (18–22 daily; 3hr 20min–4hr 30min); Limoux (16 daily; 25min); Marseille (12–18 daily; 3hr 20min–5hr 30min); Montpellier (18 daily; 1hr 30min–4hr); Narbonne (22 daily; 35min); Nîmes (26 daily; 2hr 5min–3hr 10min); Quillan (6 daily; 1hr 15min); Toulouse (22 daily; 45min–1hr).

The most memorable site in the Montaigne Noire is the Châteaux de Lastours, the most northerly of the Cathar castles. There are, in fact, four castles here – their ruined keeps jutting superbly from a sharp ridge of scrub and cypress that plunges to rivers on both sides. The two oldest, Cabaret (mid-eleventh century) and Surdespine (1153), fell into de Montfort’s hands in 1211, after their lords had given shelter to the Cathars. The other two, Tour Régine and Quertinheux, were added after 1240, when the site became royal property, and a garrison was maintained here as late as the Revolution. A path winds up from the roadside, bright in early summer with iris, cistus, broom and numerous other plants.

Narbonne
POP 51,306
The picturesque Canal de la Robine runs right through the centre of elegant Narbonne and connects the Étang de Bages-Sigean with the Canal du Midi. These days it's a charming midsize Languedoc market town, but wind the clock back two millennia and you’d be in a major Roman city: the capital of the province of Gallia Narbonensis. Exceptional sights include its cathedral and former archbishops' palace, and the town is now a popular stop-off for boaters.

The former archbishops’ palace houses several archaeological museums. Roman mosaics and stucco paintings are on display at the Musée d’Art et d’Histoire and Musée Archéologique, along with an underground gallery of Gallo-Roman shops in the Horreum, and a collection of impressive Roman masonry in the Musée Lapidaire.

Narbonne’s most distinctive landmark is actually only half-finished: construction was halted in the 14th century, and only the towers and choir reached final completion. Its treasury has a beautiful Flemish tapestry of the Creation, while grotesque gargoyles leer down upon the 16th-century cloister.

Founded by Cistercian monks in 1093, Fontfroide Abbey became one of southern France’s most powerful ecclesiastical centres during the Middle Ages. Heavily damaged during the Revolution, it was purchased in 1908 by the French painter Gustave Fayet and his wife, Madeleine, who restored much of the building. Highlights include the tranquil chapter hall, refectory and monks’ dormitory, as well as a rose garden added during the 18th century. It's 15km southwest of Narbonne via the D613. Cash payment only.
Fontfroide also produces its own renowned wine, which you can sample in the on-site wine shop or, better still, in the vaulted restaurant, La Table de Fontfroide ( GOOGLE MAP ; %04 68 41 02 26; www.fontfroide.com; chemin de Fontfroide; 2-/3-course lunch menus €21/25, 3-/4-course dinner menus €35/39; hnoon-2pm & 7-9.30pm Tue-Sat, noon-2pm Sun & Mon Jul & Aug, noon-2pm daily mid-Feb–Jun & Sep-late Dec).

MICHELIN-STAR SUPPERS

If you’re looking for a once-in-a-lifetime meal, two chefs tucked away in the countryside have won the hallowed three Michelin stars. Both also have accommodation.
Bras (%05 65 51 18 20; www.bras.fr; Laguiole; menus €140-220, mains €45-90; h7-9.30pm Tue & Wed, 11.30am-1.30pm & 7-9.30pm Thu-Sun early Apr-Nov, closed Dec-early Apr; W) Michel Bras has been based at the eponymous Bras in the village of Laguiole since 1999. His food is steeped in the rustic, country flavours of his youth, reinvented in all kinds of outlandish ways. It’s worth a trip for the restaurant alone: a modernist, plate-glass marvel, with views over Aubrac’s green hills. Double rooms start at €310. Unusually for a superstar chef, Michel Bras is self-made: he’s never strayed from his home on the Aubrac plateau, between the Massif Central and the Cévennes, and he learned many of his skills from his mother. He’s now handed over the reins to his son, Sébastien, but still makes regular appearances.
Auberge du Vieux Puits (%04 68 44 07 37; www.aubergeduvieuxpuits.fr; Fontjoncouse; menus €110-190; hnoon-1.30pm & 8-9.30pm Wed-Sat, noon-1.30pm Sun Mar-Dec, closed Jan & Feb; c) Gilles Goujon’s wonderfully relaxed Auberge du Vieux Puits is tucked away in the hilltop village of Fontjoncouse, between Narbonne and Perpignan. Goujon’s known for his fondness for humble ingredients such as Bigorre pork, woodcock, hare, boar and pigeon. The menus stretch between four and seven courses and include a ‘chariot of cheese’ that defies belief. Double rooms start at €165.
Carcassonne
POP 49,400
Perched on a rocky hilltop and bristling with zigzag battlements, stout walls and spiky turrets, the fortified city of Carcassonne looks like something out of a children’s storybook when it's seen from afar. A Unesco World Heritage Site since 1997, it’s most people’s idea of the perfect medieval castle.
La Cité, as the old walled town is now known, attracts over four million visitors every year, peaking in high summer. Time your visit for late in the day (or better still for spring and autumn) to truly appreciate the old town's medieval charm.
Sights
Beneath Carcassonne’s fortified castle La Cité, on the left bank of the Aude River, is the city’s second half, Ville Basse. It’s a mostly modern town that conceals a medieval heart: the Bastide St-Louis, which was built during the 13th century using the characteristic grid of streets set around a central square, place Carnot.
The lower town was later redeveloped during the 18th and 19th centuries, and is home to several impressive hôtels particuliers (private mansions) and religious buildings, as well as Carcassonne’s marvellous covered market, dating from 1768.
oLa CitéAREA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; enter via Porte Narbonnaise or Porte d'Aude; h24hr)
Built on a steep spur of rock, Carcassonne’s rampart-ringed fortress dates back over two millennia. The fortified town is encircled by two sets of battlements and 52 stone towers, topped by distinctive ‘witch’s hat’ roofs (added by architect Viollet-le-Duc during 19th-century restorations). A drawbridge can still be seen in the main gate of Porte Narbonnaise ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), which leads into the citadel’s interior, a maze of cobbled lanes and courtyards, now mostly lined by shops and restaurants.
The hill on which La Cité stands has been fortified many times across the centuries – by Gauls, Romans, Visigoths, Moors, Franks and Cathars, to name a few. Following the annexation of Roussillon by France in 1659, the castle’s usefulness as a frontier fortress declined and it slowly crumbled into disrepair, but it was saved from destruction by Viollet-le-Duc, who left his mark on many of France’s medieval landmarks, including Notre Dame in Paris and Vézelay in Burgundy.
The castle is laid out in a concentric pattern, with the double wall and defensive towers designed to resist attack from siege engines. The castle’s second gate, Porte d'Aude ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), was partly destroyed in 1816 and no longer has its drawbridge.
In between the walls, an interior space known as Les Lices runs for just over 1km around the castle. Though designed as a defensive space to delay would-be attackers, during the medieval era the city’s poorest residents would have built a shanty-town of houses and workshops here, which were cleared out during Viollet-le-Duc’s restorations. It’s now the best place to escape the crowds and properly appreciate the castle’s martial architecture.
To actually walk on the ramparts, you have to pay to enter the Château Comtal ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; place du Château, La Cité; adult/child €8.50/free; h10am-6.30pm Apr-Sep, 9.30am-5pm Oct-Mar), a keep built for the viscounts of Carcassonne during the 12th century. Admission includes access to the keep’s rooms and a section of the battlements, with fabulous views over the surrounding countryside and the distant Pyrenees. Guided tours in several languages are available in summer; check with the tourist office for schedules. It's free on the 1st Sunday of the month from November to March.
Before you leave, visit the lovely Basilique St-Nazaire ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; place St-Nazaire, La Cité; h9am-7pm Jul & Aug, to 6pm Sep-Jun) next to place du Château, notable for its Gothic transept and vivid rose windows. Often, traditional plain chant can be heard inside.
Pont-VieuxBRIDGE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Though it’s only one of several bridges spanning the Aude River, the Pont-Vieux is by far the oldest and prettiest. It was built during the 14th century to provide a quick link between Carcassonne’s lower and upper towns, and rebuilt in the 19th century. It’s one of the few surviving medieval bridges in France, prized for its graceful arches and compact dimensions, and is only open to pedestrians.
2Activities
When you've had your fill of architecture, take a canal cruise, go cycling or sample the local wines.
Boat Tours
Several companies offer cruises along the Canal du Midi, also a Unesco-listed wonder, providing a beautiful way to appreciate Carcassonne's architecture from afar surrounded by gorgeous countryside.
The main operators are Carcassonne Croisières ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %06 80 47 54 33; www.carcassonne-navigationcroisieres.com; Port de Plaisance; 1¼-hr cruise adult/child €8.50/6.50; h10.30am & 2pm Jul & Aug, 10.30am & 2.30pm Apr-Jun, Sep & Oct) and Le Cocagne ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %06 50 40 78 50; www.bateau-cocagne-canal-carcassonne.fr; Port de Plaisance; 1¼-hr cruise adult/child €8/6; h2pm & 6pm daily Jul & Aug, 2pm & 6pm Wed-Mon Apr-Jun, Sep & Oct). Standard cruises last around 1¼ hours, but there are longer trips available. All trips leave from the Port de Plaisance in the Ville Basse.
Wine Tasting
Experienced English-speaking company Vin en Vacances ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %06 42 33 34 09; www.vinenvacances.com; 10 rue du Pont Vieux; day tours €125-145) runs scheduled minibus tours of local vineyards from Carcassonne.
In town, most of the wines at cellar/wine-tasting establishment Vins & Vinos ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %04 68 10 97 04; www.vinsvinos.com; 38 rue Barbès; tastings from €15; h10am-6pm Tue-Fri, 9.30am-5pm Sat) come from the south of France but especially the Languedoc-Roussillon and Toulouse areas. Learn more about the terroirs and meet the winemakers during tastings and other events; check the program online.
4Sleeping
Sleeping inside the old city may seem romantic, but you might think twice once you’ve lugged your bags through the alleyways. As vehicles are banned, if you're driving you'll have to leave your car outside the city walls overnight. Staying outside the walled city is more practical (and invariably cheaper).
Auberge de JeunesseHOSTEL€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %04 68 25 23 16; www.hifrance.org; rue du Vicomte Trencavel, La Cité; dm incl breakfast €25; hclosed mid-Dec–Jan & weekends Feb; iW)
This HI hostel is smack bang in the centre of La Cité – great for atmosphere, not great if you’re arriving at the train station 4km downhill to the northwest. Facilities include four- to six-bed dorms, a spacious kitchen, an outside terrace and bike rental. It’s very popular, so book well ahead.

It’s not going to win any style awards, but this 22-room budget hotel is great value for Carcassonne. Rooms are small and bathrooms are basic, but it's just 500m east of the train station, and the private parking (€5 outside, €8 under cover) is a bonus. Bike rental is available for €10 per day.

( GOOGLE MAP ; %06 23 40 65 34; www.la-maison-vieille.com; 8 rue Trivalle; d €90-95, f €105-125; W)
As charming a B&B as you’ll find in Carcassonne, this old mansion's beautiful rooms include Barbacane in blues, Cité with exposed brick, Prince Noir with an in-room bath, and vintage-furnished Dame Carcas. Filled with fig trees, olive trees and lavender, its walled courtyard is idyllic for breakfast. It's handy for the walled city and Ville Basse; families are warmly welcomed.

Built in the 19th century in the Gothic Revival style, this is Carcassonne's most magnificent place to stay. Palatial rooms are individually appointed, many with wood panelling and/or timber beams, and some have panoramic private terraces. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the private library, which has its own bar, and there's a topiary-flanked swimming pool. Its Michelin-starred restaurant, La Barbacane, is sublime.
Eating
Restaurants in La Cité tend to be touristy; you’ll find more authentic fare at better value in the Ville Basse.
On menus you’ll often see cassoulet – a stew of vegetables, white beans and meat that is said to have been invented in the nearby village of Castelnaudry. Quality varies, so be choosy about where you try it.
Markets take place in Ville Basse on place Carnot on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday mornings.
Les HallesMARKET€

This lively local hang-out is full of office workers at lunchtime, so you know you’re in good hands. It’s great for no-fuss bistro standards, such as roast Camembert, classic steak-frites and tapas platters, and the location on place Carnot is a winner. The children's menu offers petite versions of main dishes.

In an old shuttered auberge (country inn), complete with beams and original hearth, this family-run bistro serves meaty cassoulet, along with Mediterranean-influenced dishes such as lamb with parsnip gnocchi, foie gras ravioli, aubergine and spinach cannelloni, and sea bass with squid-ink spaghetti. Ask for a table in the courtyard if it’s sunny.

The citadel location bumps up the prices considerably, but this is one of the better establishments for traditional cassoulet. The restaurant's smart dining room has cream-coloured chairs and tables and polished wooden floors, but the best seats are in the vine-draped courtyard beside an old well.

A modern dining space of white walls, white chairs and white tables is reflected in the short lunch menu of salads and tartes salées (savoury tarts), and creative versions of southwestern French classics such as l'ouillade (hearty soup made from pig's trotters, cabbage and turnips) of an evening, along with great local wines by the glass. Also has guest rooms (doubles €10).

Carcassonne's finest dining is inside the Hôtel de la Cité at chef Jérôme Ryon's Michelin-starred premises. Opulent carved woodwork and stained glass set the stage for unforgettable dishes utilising some of France's finest produce: poached Bouzigues oysters with preserved lemon; Charolais beef with potato churros and Perigord sauce; and Languedoc-grown saffron, white asparagus and black-garlic risotto with Cévennes goat's cheese.

Perpignan
POP 123,000
Framed by the peaks of the Pyrenees 13km west of the Mediterranean coastline and just 38km north of the Spanish border, Perpignan radiates out from the tight knot of the old town's warren of alleys, palm-shaded squares and shabby tenements painted in shades of lemon, peach and tangerine.
Historically, Perpignan (Perpinyà in Catalan) was capital of the kingdom of Mallorca, a Mediterranean power that stretched northwards as far as Montpellier and included all the Balearic Islands; the Mallorcan kings’ palace still stands guard at the southern end of the old town.
Its proximity to Spain means the town is strong on fiestas.



1Sights
Perpignan’s old town is roughly contained within the main ring roads of bd des Pyrénees in the west, bd Thomas Wilson in the north, bd Anatole France in the east, and bd Henri Poincaré in the south. Its shallow canal skirts its western edge.
Cars are banned in the centre, so if you’re driving you’ll have to park in one of the large municipal car parks on the edges of the old town.

Perpignan’s most dominant monument, the Palace of the Kings of Mallorca sprawls over a huge area to the south of the old town. Built in 1276, the castle was later refortified with massive red-brick walls by Louis XIV's military engineer, Vauban. These days the star-shaped citadel is sparsely furnished, but its great battlements and strategic defences still give a sense of the Mallorcan kings’ might. Views from the ramparts stretch over Perpignan’s terracotta rooftops to the coast.

Like many medieval towns, Perpignan was once encircled by defensive walls. Today all that remains is the red-brick town gate of Le Castillet, at the northern end of the old town. Inside the gateway is the Casa Païral museum, displaying Catalan ephemera from traditional bonnets and lace mantillas to an entire 17th-century kitchen.

Perpignan’s old town has several intriguing churches, but the most impressive is the Cathédrale St-Jean, begun in 1324 and not completed until 1509. Topped by a Provençal wrought-iron bell cage, the cathedral has a flat façade of red brick and smooth, zigzagging river stones.
Inside, the fine carving and ornate altarpiece are characteristically Catalan, and the simple statue of the Virgin and child in the north aisle is a venerated relic.

The cave-riddled cliffs above Tautavel, 34km northwest of Perpignan along the D117, have yielded a host of prehistoric finds, most notably a human skull unearthed in the Arago Cave that's estimated to be 450,000 years old (one of Europe's oldest such discoveries). The fascinating museum here delves into the area’s prehistoric past, with a full-size cave reproduction, displays of fossilised bones and tools, and multimedia exhibits. Admission includes a secondary exhibition at Musée des Premiers Habitants d'Europe, 500m southeast.
There's no public transport, so you'll need your own wheels.

Warm colours, tinkling jazz and walls covered in vintage signs give this cosy place the air of an old-time Parisian bistro. It’s a great bet for French favourites (confit de canard; steak-frites) and you can watch the chef at work in the semi-open kitchen.

Céret
POP 7885
Tucked in the Pyrenean foothills just off the Tech Valley, the little town of Céret conceals an unexpected surprise – one of southern France’s best modern-art museums, with a collection of stellar canvases donated by some of the 20th century’s foremost names from cubism to neorealism.
Lively festivals also take place in the town in spring and summer.
1Sights & Activities
oMusée d’Art ModerneART MUSEUM
(www.musee-ceret.com; 8 bd Maréchal Joffre; adult/child €5.50/3.50, incl temporary exhibitions €8/6; h10am-7pm Jul-Sep, to 5.30pm Tue-Sun Oct-Jun)
Roussillon had its artistic heyday around the turn of the 20th century, when Fauvist and cubist artists flocked here, attracted by the searing colours and sun-drenched landscapes. This wonderful museum was created in 1950 by Pierre Brune and Frank Burty Haviland, who convinced friends including Picasso, Matisse, Chaïm Soutine and Georges Braque to donate works. The result is one of the finest collections of modern art outside Paris. Take your time – this place is a real treat.
Céret’s artistic connections stretch back to 1910, when Catalan sculptor Manolo Hugué, painter Frank Burty Haviland and composer Déodat de Séverac settled here. They were followed in 1911 by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, along with other significant figures from the cubist and Fauvist movements, mostly escaping the spiralling rents and stifling atmosphere of the Montmartre art scene.
All the big names passed through Céret, sometimes staying for a short while, sometimes for extended periods. Reading like a who’s who of modern art, the list includes André Masson, Max Jacob, Juan Gris, Raoul Dufy, Jean Cocteau, Chaïm Soutine, Amedeo Modigliani, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dalí and Joan Miró among them.
After the museum’s formation in 1950, many of these artists (or their estates) chose to donate their works for free in recognition of Céret’s importance to their artistic development (Picasso alone donated 57 pieces, although only one painting, a still life of a dead crane and a jug).
Standout works include a moving Crucifixion (1925) by Marc Chagall, Woman, Bird, Stars by Joan Miró, and a famous cubist view of Céret by Chaïm Soutine, painted in 1919 – but there are many more to discover.

Villefranche-de-Conflent
POP 223
The Unesco-listed town of Villefranche-de-Conflent sits in a breathtaking spot, hemmed in by tall cliffs, at the strategic confluence of the valleys of the Têt and Cady Rivers. Built by Vauban, its fort dominates the valley and you can walk along the walled town's ramparts. From Villefranche, the famous mountain railway Le Train Jaune runs through the Pyrenees almost to the Spanish border.

Villefranche’s mighty fort dominates the skyline above town. Built by Vauban in 1681, it was heavily refortified by Napoléon III between 1850 and 1856. You can wander around its corner turrets and battlements, as well as the defensive keep and a former prison. A shuttle bus from town (adult/child return €10/5.10) saves you a steep climb up 734 steps.

Nicknamed Le Canari (the Canary), this bright-yellow mountain railway trundles from Villefranche-de-Conflent (427m) through spectacular Pyrenean scenery to Latour de Carol (1231m). One of France’s most famous train trips, attracting 400,000 passengers annually, it doesn't take bookings, so arrive a good hour before departure. It makes scheduled stops at eight of its 22 stations; you can alight at the others on request.
At Latour de Carol you can return to Villefranche or change for Toulouse or Barcelona.

Côte Vermeille
Named for its red rock, the Côte Vermeille (Vermilion Coast) runs south from Collioure to Cerbère on the Spanish border, where the Pyrenees foothills dip to the sea. Against a backdrop of vineyards and pinched between the Mediterranean and the mountains, it’s riddled with small, rocky bays and little ports.
The main town here is Collioure. Three kilometres to its south, Port-Vendres, Roussillon’s only natural harbour and deep-water port, has been exploited ever since Greek mariners roamed the rocky coastline. Until the independence of France’s North African territories in the 1960s, it was an important port linking them with the mainland. It’s still a significant cargo and fishing harbour, however, with everything from small coastal chuggers to giant deep-sea vessels bristling with radar. There’s also a large leisure marina, and lots of pleasant walks around the coastline nearby.
8Getting There & Away
Buses and trains run regularly along the coast from Perpignan. If you’re driving, you can follow the lovely coastal roads all the way to Banyuls-sur-Mer.
Collioure
POP 3096
Collioure, where boats bob against a backdrop of houses washed in soft pastel colours, is the smallest and most picturesque of the Côte Vermeille resorts. Once Perpignan’s port, it found fame in the early 20th century when it inspired the Fauvist artists Henri Matisse and André Derain and later both Picasso and Braque.
Today the town has more than 30 galleries and workshops, including many on rue de la Fraternité. Collioure is also famed for its wine and its prized Collioure anchovies. Like most beaches along the Côte Vermeille, Collioure’s main town beach is shingly, but pleasant enough for a paddle.

Collioure’s seaside castle was mostly built between 1276 and 1344 by the counts of Roussillon and the kings of Aragon, and was later occupied by the Mallorcan court, although the outer wall was the work of Vauban in the 17th century. Interior furnishings are minimal, but the hybrid Spanish-French architectural styles are striking and the coastal views lovely. Markets, concerts and theatre performances take place in the grounds throughout the year.

(Parc Pams)
The most scenic way to reach this 14th-century windmill is a 950m walk through olive and almond groves from Fort St-Elme along the Cami del Port de Sant Telm (about 20 minutes). Alternatively, it's a steep 150m walk from the Musée d'Art Moderne. Mediterranean views of boats, rocky coast and brilliant blue sea extend from the mill's raised base.

During the early 20th century, Collioure’s vibrant coastal hues and piercing light attracted a group of artists known as the Fauves (the Wild Animals), whose focus was pure colour.

It’s a toss-up whether the setting or the food steals the show here. Overlooking Collioure’s brilliant blue bay and red rooftops, the panoramic seaside terrace (covered and heated in winter) is an absolute stunner, while local ingredients span just-landed turbot to just-cooked lobster.

Just 14km north of the Spanish border, Banyuls is a small coastal town that began life as a fishing port but is now best known for its wines (Banyuls, Banyuls Grand Cru and Collioure). Grapes grow on the slopes around town on steep, rocky terraces divided by drystone walls, which help retain water and prevent soil erosion.
It’s a lovely spot, with three shingly but superb beaches (Centrale, Les Elmes and Centre Hélio Marin) with translucent turquoise waters, and an important marine reserve, the Réserve Naturelle Cerbère-Banyuls, 6km southeast of town, where you can snorkel and scuba dive.
