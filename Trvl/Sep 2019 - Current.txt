		Novoslobodskaya is enveloped in the art-nouveau artistry of 32 stained-glass panels. Six windows depict the so-called intellectual professions: architect, geographer, agronomist, engineer, artist and musician. At one end of the central hall is the mosaic Peace in the Whole World. The pair of white doves was a later addition to the mosaic, replacing a portrait of Stalin
		Mayakovskaya is the pièce de résistance of the Moscow metro. The grand-prize winner at the 1938 World’s Fair in New York has an art-deco central hall that’s all pink rhodonite, with slender, steel columns. The inspiring, upward-looking mosaics on the ceiling depict 24 Hours in the Land of the Soviets. This is also one of the deepest stations (33m), which allowed it to serve as an air-raid shelter during WWII

Four Seasons Moscow (from outside)
	unusual Four Seasons Moscow exhibits two contrasting architectural styles, thanks to a funny fluke of history. The story goes that Stalin was shown two possible designs for the Hotel Moskva on Manezhnaya pl. Not realising they were alternatives, he approved both. The builders did not dare point out his error, and so built half the hotel in constructivist style and half in Stalinist style. The current building is a recreation of the 1935 original

		come back at night, when the crowds are gone and the lights cast a magical glow on the historic buildings
		
		
	Resurrection Gate aka Воскресенские ворота
		great vantage point for the first glimpse of the Red Square
		
		twin red towers topped by green tent spires, the original 1680 gateway was destroyed because Stalin thought it an impediment to the parades and demonstrations held in Red Square. This exact replica was built in 1995
		
		just outside the gateway is the bright Chapel of the Iverian Virgin, originally built in the late 18th century to house the icon of the same name		
		
	towers
		Saviour Gate Tower aka Спасская башня
			clock tower soaring above Red Square
			
			this gate – considered sacred – has been used for processions since tsarist times. The two white-stone plaques above the gate commemorate the tower’s construction in 1491. The current clock was installed in the gate tower in the 1850s. Hauling 3m-long hands and weighing 25 tonnes, the clock takes up three of the tower’s 10 levels. Its melodic chime sounds every 15 minutes across Red Square			
			
		Tsar Tower
			legend has it that Ivan the Terrible watched executions and other Red Square activities from the old wooden tower that previously stood on this site
			
		Alarm Tower aka Набатная башня
			used to house the Spassky Alarm Bell, used to warn of enemy attacks and to spur popular uprisings. After quashing one such uprising, Catherine the Great was so outraged that she had the clapper removed from the bell, so it could sound no more		

	Place of Skulls aka Лобное место
		13m circular stone platform in front of St Basil's Cathedral is known as the Place of Skulls. Legend has it that it was the site of executions; in reality, it was a stage for tsarist decrees and religious ceremonies
			
				

	
!!!
Alexander Garden aka Александровский сад
	first public park in Moscow		
		back in the 17th century, the Neglinnaya River ran through the present gardens, with dams and mills along its banks. When the river was diverted underground, the garden was founded by architect Osip Bove, in 1821
		
	impressive Kremlin views
	
	every hour on the hour, the guards of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier perform a perfectly synchronised ceremony to change the guards on duty

	obelisk in Alexander Garden has been restored to its original purpose, as a monument to the House of Romanovs, originally erected to commemorate the tercentenary of the royal family's rule. In 1918 it had a dramatic change in mission when it was recast as a monument to honour 'outstanding thinkers in the struggle for the liberation of workers'. Nearly 100 years later – revolutionary thinking no longer deserving of memorialising – a replica of the original Romanovsky obelisk was restored, this time to celebrate the Romanovs' 400th anniversary

			main visitors’ entrance

			stands apart from the Kremlin’s west wall, at the end of a ramp over the Alexander Garden. The ramp was once a bridge over the Neglinnaya River and used to be part of the Kremlin’s defences; this river has been diverted underground, beneath the Alexander Garden, since the early 19th century. The Kutafya Tower is the last of a number of outer bridge towers that once stood on this side of the Kremlin

		Troitskaya Tower aka Trinity Gate Tower
			pass through the Kremlin walls

			from the Kutafya Tower, walk up the ramp and pass through the Kremlin walls beneath the 1495 Trinity Gate Tower. At 80m it's the tallest of the Kremlin’s towers. Right below your feet were the cells for prisoners in the 16th century
	
	!!!	
	Armoury aka Оружейная палата
		highlight of any visit to the Kremlin
		
		housed in Great Kremlin Palace
		dates back to 1511, when it was founded under Vasily III to manufacture and store weapons, imperial arms and regalia for the royal court, also produced jewellery, icon frames and embroidery		
		during the reign of Peter the Great all craftspeople, goldsmiths and silversmiths were sent to St Petersburg, and the Armoury became a mere museum storing the royal treasures

		tour - 1hr
			tour starts upstairs, where the first two rooms house gold and silver from the 12th to 20th centuries, many of which were crafted in the Kremlin workshops. There's jewellery, dishes and sacred items crafted from precious metals and jewels
			
			in Room 2, you'll find the renowned Easter eggs made by St Petersburg jeweller Fabergé. The tsar and tsarina traditionally exchanged these gifts each year at Easter. Most famous is the Grand Siberian Railway egg, with gold train, platinum locomotive and ruby headlamp, created to commemorate the Moscow–Vladivostok line
			
			following rooms display armour, weapons and more armour and more weapons. Don’t miss the helmet of Prince Yaroslav, the chainmail of Boris Godunov, and the sabres of Minin and Pozharsky
			
			downstairs in Room 6, you can see the coronation dresses of 18th-century empresses (Empress Elizabeth, we’re told, had 15,000 other dresses). Look for Catherine the Great's wedding gown, which is covered with silver brocade (note the 43cm waist size!). Other 'secular' clothing is also on display, including an impressive pair of boots that belonged to Peter the Great
			
			following room contains some impressive furniture, including the 800-diamond throne of Tsar Alexey. The most unusual item, perhaps, is the joint coronation throne of boy tsars Peter the Great and his half-brother Ivan V (with a secret compartment from which Regent Sofia prompted them). In the same room, you'll see the glittering and fur-lined crowns of the emperors through the ages. The gold Cap of Monomakh, jewel-studded and sable-trimmed, was used for two centuries at coronations

			end your tour in Room 9, which houses centuries’ worth of royal carriages and sledges. One of the oldest is the luxurious carriage that was a gift from King James of England to Boris Godunov in 1604. Look also for the sleigh in which Elizabeth rode from St Petersburg to Moscow for her coronation, pulled by 23 horses at a time – about 800 in all for the trip
	
	Diamond Fund aka Алмазный фонд		
		can be skipped as Armoury also has diamond exposition		
			managed by the Ministry of Finance, which retains a monopoly on the mining and sale of precious stones. As such, the collection includes many magnificent raw diamonds, some in excess of 300 carats
		security is super tight and you are not allowed to bring cameras, phones or bags of any sort
		dates back to 1719, when Peter the Great established the Russian Crown treasury
			bulk of the exhibit is gemstones and jewellery garnered by tsars and empresses
				190-carat diamond given to Catherine the Great by her lover Grigory Orlov
				Great Imperial Crown, encrusted with 4936 diamonds, was the coronation crown of Catherine the Great and successive rulers
		
	???
	Patriach's Palace and Church of the Twelve Apostles
		mostly built in the mid-17th century for Patriarch Nikon, whose reforms sparked the break with the Old Believers
		highlight is the ceremonial Cross Hall (Крестовая палата), where the tsar’s and ambassadorial feasts were held. From the 18th century the room was used to produce miro (a holy oil used during church services, which contains over 30 herbal components); the oven and huge pans from the production process are on display
		palace now contains an exhibit of 17th-century household items, including jewellery, hunting equipment and furniture
		from here you can access the five-domed Church of the Twelve Apostles, which has a gilded, wooden iconostasis and a collection of icons by leading 17th-century icon painters
		
	Assumption Cathedral aka Успенский собор
		focal church of prerevolutionary Russia
			striking 1660s fresco of the Virgin Mary faces Sobornaya pl, above the door once used for royal processions
		if you have limited time, come straight here
		visitors entrance is at the western end
		
		history
			In 1470 Russian architects Krivtsov and Myshkin were commissioned by Ivan the Great to replace the old dilapidated cathedral, which dated from 1326. As soon as the ceiling was put up, one of the walls collapsed. Krivtsov and Myshkin lost their jobs, and Italian architect Aristotle Fioravanti was given a crack at it. After the foundation was completed, Fioravanti toured Novgorod, Suzdal and Vladimir to acquaint himself with Russian architecture. His design is a more spacious version of the Assumption Cathedral at Vladimir, with a Renaissance twist
			
			in 1812 French troops used the Assumption Cathedral as a stable; they also looted 295kg of gold and over 5 tonnes of silver from here, but much of it was recovered

			church closed in 1918. According to some accounts, in 1941, when the Nazis were on the outskirts of Moscow, Stalin secretly ordered a service in the cathedral to protect the city from the enemy. The cathedral was officially returned to the Church in 1989, but it now operates as a museum

		frescoes & murals
			The interior of the Assumption Cathedral is unusually bright and spacious, full of frescoes painted in warm golds, reds and blues. The west wall features a scene of the Apocalypse, a favourite theme of the Russian Church in the Middle Ages. The pillars have pictures of martyrs, considered to be the pillars of faith. Above the southern gates there are frescoes of Yelena and Constantine, who brought Christianity to Greece and the south of Russia. The space above the northern gate depicts Olga and Vladimir, who brought Christianity to the north.
			
			Most of the existing images on the cathedral walls were painted on a gilt base in the 1640s, with the exception of three grouped together on the south wall: The Apocalypse (Апокалипсис), The Life of Metropolitan Pyotr (Житие Митрополита Петра) and All Creatures Rejoice in Thee (О тебе радуется). These are attributed to Dionysius and his followers, the cathedral’s original 15th-century mural painters.

		Throne of Monomakh
			Near the south wall, the tent-roofed wooden throne is known as the Throne of Monomakh. It was made in 1551 for Ivan the Terrible. Its carved scenes highlight the career of 12th-century Grand Prince Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev – considered to be Ivan's direct predecessor.

		Iconostasis
			iconostasis dates from 1652, but its lowest level contains some older icons. The 1340s Saviour with the Angry Eye (Спас Ярое око) is second from the right. On the left of the central door is the Virgin of Vladimir (Владимирская Богоматерь), an early-15th-century Rublyov-school copy of Russia’s most revered image, the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God (Владимирская икона Богоматери). The 12th-century original, now in Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery, stood in the Assumption Cathedral from the 1480s to 1930. One of the oldest Russian icons, the 12th-century red-clothed St George (Святой Георгий) from Novgorod, is by the north wall.

			The original icons of the lower, local tier are symbols of victory brought from Vladimir, Smolensk, Veliky Ustyug and other places. The south door was brought from the Nativity of the Virgin Cathedral in Suzdal.		

	Archangel Cathedral
		coronation, wedding and burial church of tsars
		built by Ivan Kalita in 1333 to commemorate the end of the great famine, and dedicated to Archangel Michael, guardian of the Moscow princes		
		
		tombs of almost all Muscovy’s rulers from the 1320s to the 1690s are here. The only absentee is Boris Godunov, whose body was taken out of the grave on the order of a ‘False Dmitry’ and buried at Sergiev Posad in 1606. The bodies are buried underground, beneath the 17th-century sarcophagi and 19th-century copper covers. Tsarevitch Dmitry (a son of Ivan the Terrible), who died mysteriously in 1591, lies beneath a painted stone canopy. It was Dmitry’s death that sparked the appearance of a string of impersonators, known as False Dmitrys, during the Time of Troubles. Ivan’s own tomb is out of sight behind the iconostasis, along with those of his other sons, Ivan (whom he killed) and Fyodor I (who succeeded him). From Peter the Great onwards, emperors and empresses were buried in St Petersburg, the exception being Peter II, who died in Moscow and is here.

		some 17th-century murals were uncovered during restorations of the Archangel Cathedral in the 1950s. The south wall depicts many of the rulers buried here; on the pillars are some of their predecessors, including Andrei Bogolyubsky, Prince Daniil and Alexander Nevsky		
		
	Annunciation Cathedral aka Благовещенский собор
		royal family’s private chapel
			under Orthodox law, the fourth marriage of Ivan the Terrible disqualified him from entering the church proper, so he had the southern gallery of the Annunciation Cathedral converted into the Archangel Gabriel Chapel, from where he could watch services through a grille
		impressive murals in the gallery			
			many murals in the gallery date from the 1560s. Among them are Capture of Jericho in the northern porch, Jonah and the Whale in the northern arm of the gallery and the Tree of Jesus on its ceiling. Other frescoes feature ancient philosophers such as Aristotle, Plutarch, Plato and Socrates holding scrolls inscribed with their own wise words. Socrates’ scroll reads: ‘No harm will ever come to a good man. Our soul is immortal. After death the good shall be rewarded and the evil punished.' Plato’s says: ‘We must hope God shall send us a heavenly Teacher and a Guide’.
		central chapel features the celebrated icons of master painters Theophanes the Greek and Andrei Rublyov
		small central part of the cathedral has a lovely jasper floor
		iconostasis
			real treasure - in the 1920s restorers uncovered early-15th-century icons by three of the greatest medieval Russian artists. It was most likely Theophanes who painted the six icons at the right-hand end of the biggest row of the six tiers of the iconostasis. From left to right, these are the Virgin Mary, Christ Enthroned, St John the Baptist, the Archangel Gabriel, the Apostle Paul and St John Chrysostom. Theophanes was a master of portraying pathos in the facial expressions of his subjects, setting these icons apart from most others.
			third icon from the left, Archangel Michael, is ascribed to Andrei Rublyov, who may also have painted the adjacent St Peter. Rublyov is also reckoned to be the artist of the first, second, sixth and seventh (and probably the third and fifth) icons from the left end of the festival row, above the deesis (biggest) row. The seven icons at the right-hand end are attributed to Prokhor of Gorodets
		archaeology exhibit in the basement
			remnant of the 14th-century church that previously occupied this site. On display are hundreds of artefacts – glassware, ceramics, tools and woodwork – that were excavated from Borovitsky Hill in the 1960s and 1970s
			
	Sobornaya pl
		every Saturday at noon from April to October, the Presidential Regiment shows up on Sobornaya pl for a ceremonial procession, featuring some very official-looking prancing and dancing, both on foot and on horseback			
	
	Ivan the Great Bell Tower
		before the 20th century it was forbidden to build any higher in Moscow
		climb the 137 steps to the top for sweeping views
			45-minute audio tour ends with a 137-step climb to the top of the tall tower, yielding an amazing (and unique!) view of Sobornaya pl, with the Church of Christ the Saviour and the Moskva-City skyscrapers in the distance
		
		in 1505, Italian Marco Bono designed a new belfry, originally with only two octagonal tiers beneath a drum and a dome. In 1600 Boris Godunov raised it to 81m (local legend says that this was a public works project designed to employ the thousands of people who had come to Moscow during a famine)

The bell was cooling off in the foundry casting pit in 1737 when it came into contact with water, causing an 11-tonne chunk to break off.

	History
		A 'kremlin' – or fortified stronghold – has existed on this site since Moscow’s earliest years. In 1147 Yury Dolgoruky summoned his allies to this spot, which would have been occupied by a wooden fort. When the city became the capital of medieval Rus in the 1320s, the Kremlin served as the headquarters of the Russian Orthodox Church and the seat of the prince
		
		The ambition of Ivan III (the Great) was to build a capital that would equal the fallen Constantinople in grandeur, power, achievements and architecture. In an effort to build the ‘Third Rome’, Ivan brought from Italy stonemasons and architects, who built new walls, three great cathedrals and other structures. Most of the present-day buildings date from this period
			
		Although Peter I (the Great) shifted the capital to St Petersburg, the tsars still showed up here for coronations and other celebrations. The fortress was captured by Napoleon, who inflicted serious damage before making his retreat in 1812. But still the ancient symbol endured. The citadel wouldn’t be breached again until the Bolsheviks stormed the place in November 1917

St Basil’s Cathedral

	R400
	audio guide R200
	
	11am-6pm


	in 1552 Ivan the Terrible captured the Tatar stronghold of Kazan on the Feast of Intercession. He commissioned this landmark church, officially the Intercession Cathedral, to commemorate the victory
	
	official name of St Basil’s Cathedral is the Intercession Cathedral. The misnomer ‘St Basil’s’ refers to the extra northeastern chapel, which was built over the grave of Vasily (Basil) the Blessed
	
	legend has it that Ivan had the architects blinded so that they could never build anything comparable. This is a myth, however, as records show that they were employed a quarter of a century later (and four years after Ivan’s death) to add an additional chapel to the structure
	
	out front of St Basil’s is a statue of Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky, one a butcher and the other a prince, who raised and led the army that ejected occupying Poles from the Kremlin in 1612

	
	Don't miss
		Church of St Vasily the Blessed
		Portals from the vestry to the central church
		Icon of the Old Testament Trinity
		Icon of the Life of St Alexander Nevsky

		
	Exterior
		cathedral’s apparent anarchy of shapes hides a comprehensible plan of nine main chapels
		
		tall, tent-roofed tower in the centre houses the namesake Church of the Intercession of the Mother of God

		four biggest domes top four octagonal-towered chapels
			Church of Sts Cyprian & Justina
			Church of the Holy Trinity
			Church of the Icon of St Nicholas the Miracle Worker
			Church of the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem
			
			there are four smaller chapels in between, each consecrated in honour of an event or battle in the struggle against Kazan
		
		onion domes were originally green, most likely acquiring their characteristic colours and patterns during an 18th-century restoration
	
	
	Church of St Vasily the Blessed
		The Church of St Vasily the Blessed, the northeastern chapel on the ground floor, contains the canopy-covered crypt of its namesake saint, one of the most revered in Moscow. Vasily (Basil) the Blessed was known as a 'holy fool', sometimes going naked and purposefully humiliating himself for the greater glory of God. He was believed to be a seer and miracle maker, and even Ivan the Terrible revered and feared him. This 10th chapel – the only one at ground level – was added in 1588, after the saint's death. Look for the icon depicting St Vasily himself, with Red Square and the Kremlin in the background

	Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God
		The tall, tent-roofed tower in the centre of the cathedral houses the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God. The ceiling soars to nearly 47m. Some of the walls have been restored to their original appearance (a painted red-brick pattern), while others show off fragments of oil murals that were painted later. From the vestry, the doorways into this central chapel are among the most elaborate architectural elements in the cathedral, gorgeously embellished with tile and brickwork

	Church of the Holy Trinity
		With whitewashed walls and a spiralling symbol of eternity painted in the vault, the light-filled Church of the Holy Trinity is a favourite. A gorgeous 16th-century chandelier is suspended from the 20m ceiling. But the gem of the room is the unusual iconostasis. The 16th-century Icon of the Old Testament Trinity in the third tier is among the oldest and most esteemed pieces of artwork in the cathedral

	Church of St Cyprian & St Justina
		The colourful Church of Sts Cyprian & Justina is adorned with oil paintings depicting the lives of the 4th-century saints, as well as Biblical stories. At 20m, the vault in the dome depicts the Mother of God of the Burning Bush. The paintings and the iconostasis date to the end of the 18th century

	Church of the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem
		This chapel is dedicated to the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem, also known in Orthodoxy as Willow Sunday. At 23m, this is one of the tallest towers in the cathedral. Whitewashed walls (as originally painted) show off the architectural elements. Above the northern entrance, you can see the scar left by a shell that hit the wall in October 1917. The iconostasis was moved from the Cathedral of St Alexander Nevsky in the Kremlin in 1770. One of the most sacred and revered pieces in the cathedral is the 17th-century icon of the Life of St Alexander Nevsky, which depicts 33 scenes from the saint's life

		decorative panel on the hotel’s central facade, facing Teatralny proezd, is based on a sketch by the artist Mikhail Vrubel
			depicts the legend of the Princess of Dreams, in which a troubadour falls in love with a kind and beautiful princess and travels across the seas to find her. He falls ill during the voyage and is near death when he finds his love. The princess embraces him, but he dies in her arms. Naturally, the princess reacts to his death by renouncing her worldly life. The ceramic panels were made at the pottery workshop at Savva Mamontov’s estate in Abramtsevo
			
		ceramic work on the side of the hotel facing Teatralnaya pl is by the artist Alexander Golovin. The script was originally a quote from Nietzsche: ‘Again the same story: when you build a house you notice that you have learned something’. During the Soviet era, these wise words were replaced with something more appropriate for the time: ‘Only the dictatorship of the proletariat can liberate mankind from the oppression of capitalism’. Lenin, of course

	history
		Catherine the Great, one of the greatest art collectors of all time, began the collection. Nicholas I also greatly enriched it and opened the galleries to the public for the first time in 1852

		it was the post-revolutionary period that saw the collection increase threefold, as many valuable private collections were seized by the state, including those of the Stroganovs, Sheremetyevs and Yusupovs. In 1948 it incorporated the renowned collections of post-Impressionist and Impressionist paintings of Moscow industrialists Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov

		
	visiting
		five linked buildings along riverside Dvortsovaya nab (from west to east):
			Winter Palace aka Зимний дворец
				stunning mint-green, white and gold profusion of columns, windows and recesses, with its roof topped by rows of classical statues, was commissioned from Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1754 by Empress Elizabeth. Catherine the Great and her successors had most of the interior remodelled in a classical style by 1837. It remained an imperial home until 1917, though the last two tsars spent more time in other palaces
			
			Small Hermitage aka Малый Эрмитаж
				used by Catherine the Great as a retreat and to house the art collection started by Peter the Great, which she significantly expanded
						
			Great (Old) Hermitage aka Большой (Старый) Эрмитаж
				mainly houses Italian Rennaissance art including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Giorgione, Titian, Botticelli, Caravaggio and Tiepolo

			New Hermitage aka Новый Эрмитаж
				built for Nicholas II in 1852, to hold the growing art collection and as a museum for the public. Designed by German neoclassicist architect and painter von Klenze, the historically preserved rooms house the museum's collections of ancient art, European paintings, sculptures and decorative art

			Hermitage Theatre
				once the private theatre of the imperial family, and stands on the site of the original Winter Palace of Peter I

		second-floor highlights

			!!!
			rooms 151–189: Russian Culture & Imperial Apartments

				huge collection from ancient Rus (10th to 15th centuries) through to the 18th century, including artefacts, icons, portraits and furniture

				private apartments of the last tsar, Nicholas II, and the imperial family
					rooms were completed in 1894, and they now show off elaborate 19th-century interiors
					
				Rooms 151 & 153 
					long corridor, broken up by a vast clock, contains portraits of all the Russian tsars from Peter the Great to Nicholas II

				Rooms 155–156
					Moorish Dining Room and Rotunda

				Rooms 157–162 
					Petrovsky Gallery displays personal effects and equipment used by Peter the Great, as well as some beautiful early-18th-century furniture. Look for the ivory chandelier that was partly built by Peter himself
					
				Room 161
					In 1880 there was an attempt on the life of Alexander II in this room. A young revolutionary, Khalturin, planted a bomb in the room below. It killed 11 soldiers when it went off, although the tsar had wandered into another room at the time
					
				Room 178
					Nicholas II spent much of his time in this wonderful Gothic library, topped with a sublime walnut ceiling

				Room 181
					relatively small and intimate Pompeii dining room
					
				Room 187 
					griffin-motif furniture in this palace drawing room dates from 1805
					
				Room 188 
					small dining room where the Provisional Government was arrested by the Bolsheviks in 1917
					
				Room 189 
					Two tonnes of gorgeous green columns, boxes, bowls and urns have earned this room the name ‘Malachite Hall’, and it is one of the most striking rooms in the entire palace. The handiwork of architect Alexander Bryullov, it was completed in 1839. Three figurines on the wall represent Day, Night and Poetry. This was where the last meeting of the 1917 Provisional Government occurred, on the fateful nights of 25 and 26 October 1917; they were arrested soon after, in the Small Dining Room next door.

					
			rooms 190–192: Neva Enfilade
				three grand ceremonial halls often used for temporary exhibitions

				Room 190
					this Concert Hall was used for small soirées. The enormous ornate silver tomb was commissioned by Empress Elizabeth for the remains of Alexander Nevsky
					
				Room 191
					as many as 5000 guests could be entertained in the Great Hall (also called Nicholas Hall). The palace’s largest room was the scene of imperial winter balls

				Room 192
					this anteroom was used for pre-ball champagne buffets
					

			rooms 193–198: Great Enfilade
				more state rooms here

				Room 193
					Field Marshals’ Hall is known for its military-themed chandelier and its portraits of seven of Russia’s military leaders

				Room 194
					Hall of Peter the Great contains his none-too-comfy throne.

				Room 195
					gilt Armorial Hall contains chandeliers engraved with the coat-of-arms of all the Russian provinces

				Room 197
					1812 War Gallery is hung with 332 portraits of Russian and allied Napoleonic war leaders

				Room 198
					St George’s Hall served as the state rooms where the imperial throne used to sit. With white Carrara marble imported from Italy and floors crafted from the wood of 16 different tree species, it is a splendid affair

					
			!!!
			room 204: Pavilion Hall & Hanging Garden
					ceremonial Pavilion Hall is an airy white-and-gold room sparkling with 28 chandeliers and the famous Peacock Clock (centrepiece of the Pavilion Hall)
						incredible Peacock Clock, created by James Cox and gifted to Catherine the Great in 1781 by Grigory Potemkin. A revolving dial in one of the toadstools tells the time: as it strikes the hour the automaton peacock spreads its wings and the toadstools, owl and cock come to life. A video beside the clock shows the action in close-up detail should you not be around for the once-weekly performance at 7pm on Wednesday
					
					south windows look on to Catherine the Great’s hanging garden (built over the stables), while the north overlooks the Neva. The amazing floor mosaic in front of the windows is a copy of that in the Roman bath of Otricoli (Ocriculum) near Rome

				
			!!!
			rooms 207–238: Italian Art
				highlights are certainly the works by the Renaissance artists: Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Giorgione and Titian. Look also for Botticelli, Caravaggio and Tiepolo
				
				???
				Room 207
					earliest example in this collection is The Crucifixion, painted by Ugolino di Tedice in the second half of the 13th century				

				!!!
				Room 214
					of a dozen or so original paintings by da Vinci that exist in the world, two are here. The very different Benois Madonna (1478) and Madonna Litta (1490) are named after their last owners. For years, the latter was considered lost. However, in 1909, the Russian architect Leon Benois surprised the art world when he revealed that it was part of his father-in-law’s collection

				!!!
				Room 217
					Giorgione is one of the most mysterious painters of the Renaissance, as only a few paintings exist that are known for certain to be his work. A portrait of idealised beauty, Judith is said to represent the inseparability of life and death

				!!!
				Room 221
					the work of Titian, the best representative of the Venetian school during the 16th century, is featured here: Danaya and St Sebastian are widely accepted as two of his masterpieces

				!!!
				Room 224				
					accessed off this room is the Hermitage Theatre; there are lovely views from the connecting corridor over the Neva

				!!!
				Rooms 226–227: Loggia of Raphael
					when Catherine the Great visited the Vatican she was so impressed that she commissioned Quarenghi to create this copy of a Vatican gallery; a team of Raphael’s students recreated the master’s murals on canvas. Note the occasional Russification on these versions: the two-headed eagle of the Romanov dynasty replaces the papal coat-of-arms

				!!!
				Room 229
					here you’ll enjoy two pieces by Raphael, The Holy Family and Madonna and Child, as well as many pieces by his disciples

				!!!
				Room 230
					the Hermitage’s only piece by Michelangelo, a marble statue of a crouching boy

				!!!
				Rooms 237–238 
					these Italian Skylight Halls are bathed in natural light, which highlights the ornately moulded ceilings
					

			???
			rooms 239–240: Spanish Art
				collection includes the most noteworthy artists of this ‘Golden Age’ of Spanish painting: Murillo, Ribera and, of course, Velázquez
				
				collection also includes two remarkable paintings from the 16th century: the marvellous St Peter and St Paul, by El Greco, and St Sebastian Cured by St Irene, by Ribera

								
			room 243: Knights’ Hall
				Nicholas I started collecting artistic weapons and armaments from around the world. Here is the Western European collection, featuring four impressive 16th-century German knights sitting atop their armoured horses

				
			???
			rooms 245–247: Flemish Art
				dedicated to 17th-century Flanders are almost entirely consumed by three artists: Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony Van Dyck and Frans Snyders.

				
			!!!
			rooms 249–254: Dutch Art
				Dutch collection contains more than 1000 pieces
				
				Room 254
					26 paintings by Rembrandt in Room 254 nearly outshine anything else in these rooms. The collection traces his career, starting with Flora and The Descent from the Cross, which are noticeably lighter but more detailed. His later work tends to be darker and more penetrating, such as the celebrated The Return of the Prodigal Son. Painted between 1663 and 1665, it arguably represents the height of Rembrandt’s mastery of psychology in his paintings. The solemn baroque masterpiece is a moving portrait of unquestioning parental love and mercy
				

			???
			rooms 263–268: German Art
				small collection of German art ranges from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Among the earliest works here are five paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder.

				
			!!!
			room 271: Great Church
				this Rastrelli-designed chapel is one of the Winter Palace's most dazzling spaces, with a white and gilt dome and the ceiling painting The Ascension of Christ by Pyotr Basin

				
			???
			rooms 272–288 & 290–297: French Art & Interiors
				these rooms trace the development of French art from the 15th to the 18th centuries, including tapestries, ceramics, metalwork and paintings. Look for rooms devoted to Nicholas Poussin, founder of French classicism, and Claude Lorrain, master of the classical landscape. Room 282, Alexander Hall, is a testament to the victory over Napoleon in 1812.


			???
			rooms 298–301: British Art
				these rooms showcase 15th- to 18th-century British art
				
				highlights:
					Room 298
						Portrait of a Lady in Blue, by Thomas Gainsborough, perhaps the most famous piece in the English collection
					Room 300
						The Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpents by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which was commissioned by Catherine the Great to symbolise the growing strength of Russia.

				St Nicholas the Miracle Worker with Life
			
			Room 3 
				features Russian master Andrei Rublev’s massive paintings of the apostles Peter and Paul as well as his Presentation
			
			Room 4

		Rooms 5–7: Petrine & Post-Petrine Art
			Room 6 
				some charmingly odd canvases in very strange shapes as well as mosaic portraits of both Peter and Catherine the Great, as well as of Elizabeth I, Peter’s daughter. The centre of the room is taken up by a huge portrait of the ill-fated Peter III, but look out for the impressive bust of Prince Menshikov
				
			Room 7 
				amazingly ornate ceiling. The room houses a sculpture of Empress Anna with an Arab Boy and a few impressive tapestries, including one that depicts Peter the Great at the Battle of Poltava, his greatest military victory
				
				
		???
		Rooms 8–11: Rise of the Academy
				early works of the St Petersburg Academy of Arts. These artists borrowed the European classical aesthetic for their work
		
				!!!
				Room 11 
					Rossi-designed White Hall, which was Grand Duke Mikhail’s drawing room. Here, the interior is the art – in this case representing the Empire epoch. It’s wonderfully ornate and shiny – a perfect place to host musical greats like Strauss and Berlioz, who performed here

		Rooms 12–17: Dominance of the Academy
				
				Room 12 
					Vladimir Borovikovsky’s magnificent Catherine II Promenading in Tsarskoe Selo and his Portrait of Murtaza Kuli, his picture of the brother of the Persian Shah
					
				Room 13 
					full of paintings of peasant subjects with uplifting titles such as Peeling Beetroot.

				!!!
				Room 14
					truly spectacular, including enormous canvases such as Karl Bryullov’s incredible The Last Day of Pompeii and The Crucifixion, and Ivan Aivazovsky's terrifying The Wave
					
				Room 15 
					impressive, with the far wall made up of studies for Alexander Ivanov’s masterpiece The Appearance of Christ Before the People (1837–57), which hangs in Moscow’s Tretyakov Gallery. Ivanov spent 20 years on this work, but it was met with a negative critical reception. However, later generations appreciated the work, and even these studies, many of which mark a notable departure in terms of detail and representation

		Rooms 18–22: Genre Painting

				incredibly idealised rural Russia
			
			Room 19

			Room 22 
				huge rendition of Pugachev's Judgement by Vasily Perov.
				
			
		???
		Rooms 23–24: The Wanderers
			works by the Wanderers (Peredvizhniki), a group of Academy artists who saw their future outside the strict confines of that institution. They wandered among the people, painting scenes of realism that had never been seen before in Russian art. Prime examples include Nikolai Perov's animated Hunters at Rest and the Monastery Refectory, a scathing critique of the Church establishment's greed. Also keep an eye out for Pavel Christiakov's serene Jovannina Sitting on Window Sill.

		
		???		
		Rooms 25 & 26: Konstantin Makovsky & Nicholas Ghe
			Room 25 
				devoted to Konstantin Makovsky (1839–1915), who painted the incredibly cinematic Festivity During the Carnival on Admiralty Sq in St Petersburg at the age of just 30. Also a standout is his portrait of his wife Julija

			Room 26
				Ghe’s masterpiece, Peter I Interrogating Tsarevich Alexey in Peterhof, along with other dark Ghe works such as The Last Supper
				
		???
		Rooms 27–32: Landscapes & Portraits
			landscape artists such as Ivan Shishkin were still popular. These rooms also document the rise of populist art, which had a strong social conscience and sought to educate the public. Examples of this are Konstantin Savitsky’s To War (Room 31) and Grigory Myasoyedov's lyrical Harvest Time

			Room 28 
				pause to take in the talent of Ukrainian artist Marie Bashkirtseff (1858–84) who died young but not before painting striking portraits, such as Umbrella and the Three Smiles series

		
		Rooms 33–34: Ilya Repin
			Barge Haulers on the Volga 
			Cossacks Writing a Letter to the Turkish Sultan
			marvellous portrait of a barefoot Leo Tolstoy.

		Rooms 35–47: Late-19th-Century Russian Art
			large number of contradictory styles that were fashionable in St Petersburg before the explosion of the avant-garde

			Mark Antokolsky’s statues Ivan the Terrible and Death of Socrates are on display

		Rooms 66–71: Early-20th-Century Art
			2nd floor of the Benois Wing
			
			Room 66
				works by the father of modern Russian art, Mikhail Vrubel. Some of his groundbreaking works include Epic Hero (Bogatyr) and Flying Demon				
				
			Rooms 67 to 71 
				works by an array of important early-20th-century painters including Nikolai Sapunin, Mikhail Nesterov and Boris Kustodiev, whose Merchant’s Wife at Tea is perhaps the most well-known picture here
				
		!!!
		Rooms 72–78: Russian Avant-Garde Painting
			
			Room 72 
				home to Nathan Altman’s gorgeous, semi-cubist Portrait of the Poetess Anna Akhmatova, painted in 1914, and it remains one of his most famous works even though Akhmatova apparently didn’t care for it herself. In the same room is Altman’s striking Self Portrait (1911)
				
			Room 74 
				contains primitivist paintings by artist couple Natalya Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov
				
				
			Rooms 75 to 76
				futurism and suprematism, including works by Malevich such as Black Square and Vladimir Tatlin's Counter Relief
				
			Room 77 
				devoted to constructivism and features works by Alexander Rodchenko and Vladimir Lebedev
			
			Room 78
				displays the bright, ethereal work of Pavel Filonov

		Rooms 80–81: Early Soviet Art
			paintings from the Stalin era
			

		???
		Rooms 82–86: Late Soviet Art
			with Stalin gone and the ‘thaw’ under way in the 1950s, Soviet art recovered somewhat from the severity of socialist realism. Idealised images of rural life and peasants still feature very strongly, however. Look for Alexei Sundukov's Queue which captures the failed economy of the times and Dmitry Zhilinsky's The Artist's Family, showing several generations of a family
			
						
		Rooms 87–94: Applied & Decorative Art
			Works in these galleries range from a beautifully glazed ceramic fireplace by Mikhail Vrubel and other art nouveau–inspired pieces, to Soviet-era porcelain and textiles printed with ingenious patterns made out of tiny tractors or planes
			
			
		Rooms 101–109: Temporary Exhibitions
			to reach these from the 1st floor of the Benois Wing (following your tour of the museum's main collection), use the stairs down off rooms 91 and 92

		Impressionists & Post-Impressionists
		
			inspired by romanticism, a group of painters in the 1860s began experimenting with painting modern life and landscapes, endeavouring to capture the overall effect of a scene instead of being overly concerned with details. The new trend – radical in its time – was known as Impressionism
		

			arguably the best collection in the world of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings
				much of this artwork was displayed for the first time in the 1990s, when the museum revealed some fabulous pieces, kept secret since seizure by the Red Army from Germany at the end of WWII

		Barbizon School
			next to Room 452 is a series of unnumbered rooms displaying works from the Barbizon School, named for the village in France where this group of artists settled.

		!!!
		Russian Avant-Garde
			Room 444
				couple of Kandinsky’s early works
				Kazimir Malevich's Black Square (1915), the most striking painting of the Petrograd avant-garde
					
					Malevich created several variants of the simple black square against a white background throughout his career, of which this is the fourth and last. It was taken by many as a nihilistic declaration of the ‘end of painting’, causing both awe and outrage
					
					Black Square went missing during the Soviet period, mysteriously reappearing in southern Russia in 1993. Oligarch Vladimir Potanin bought the painting for $US1 million and donated it to the Hermitage in 2002.


		!!!
		20th Century
			Rooms 430 to 440
				over 40 paintings by Matisse and almost as many by Picasso
					
					Henri Matisse was initially classified as a Fauvist, but he continued to paint in his own particular style, even as Fauvism declined in the early 20th century. Around this time, Matisse met Pablo Picasso and the two became lifelong friends. Picasso is best known as the founder and master of cubism, but again his work spanned many styles.

					A turning point for Matisse – and perhaps his most famous work – is The Dance (1910). The intense colours and the dancing nudes convey intense feelings of freedom. This panel – along with the accompanying The Music – was painted specifically for Russian businessman Sergei Shchukin. While these panels are certainly commanding, don’t miss The Red Room and Portrait of the Artist’s Wife.

					Picasso’s blue period is characterised by sombre paintings in shades of blue. When he was only 22, he painted The Absinthe Drinker, a haunting portrait of loneliness and isolation. The sensuous Dance of the Veils (1907) and Woman with a Fan (1908) are excellent representations of his cubist work, as are the ceramics on display here.

		French architect Auguste de Montferrand began designing the cathedral in 1818. Due partly to technical issues, it took so long to build (until 1858) that Nicholas I was able to insist on an even more grandiose structure than Montferrand had originally planned. More than 100kg of gold leaf was used to cover the 21.8m-high dome alone, while the huge granite pillars on the building’s facade each weigh over 120 tonnes. There’s a statue of Montferrand holding a model of the cathedral on the west facade, although Nicholas I denied the architect his dying wish, to be buried here, considering it too high an honour for a mere artisan

	Fabergé founded his jewellery business in St Petersburg in 1842. At its height he employed 700 people across many factories and in four shops in Russia and one in London. The tradition of tsars giving their wives jewelled Easter eggs began in 1885 when Alexander III commissioned the 37-year-old Fabergé to create a present for his Danish wife Maria Feodorovna. From 1897, the new tsar Nicholas II asked the jeweller to continue making the eggs for his mother, now the Dowager Empress, and his own wife Alexandra Feodorovna

	branch of the Hermitage
	
	built to the grandiose tastes of Prince Alexander Menshikov, Peter the Great’s closest friend and the first governor of St Petersburg
		interiors are some of the oldest and best preserved in the city
		St Petersburg’s first stone building.


	Menshikov was of humble origins (he is said to have sold pies on the streets of Moscow as a child), but his talent for both organisation and intrigue made him the second-most important person in the Russian Empire by the time of Peter’s death in 1725. His palace, built mainly between 1710 and 1714, was the city’s smartest residence at the time (compare it to Peter the Great’s tiny Summer Palace across the river). Peter used Menshikov's palace for official functions
	
	the 1st floor displays some stunning Dutch tile work, intended to fortify the rooms against humidity to help ease Menshikov’s tuberculosis. Original furniture and the personal effects of Menshikov are on display and each room has a fact sheet in English explaining its history. Vavara’s Chamber is particularly evocative of how the aristocracy lived during Peter’s time, while the impressive Walnut Study also stands out

	also of note is the magnificent Grand Hall, where balls and banquets were held, including the infamous reception for Peter's dwarf wedding, in which Peter and his court sniggered as some 70-odd dwarfs from all over Russia attended the wedding and the subsequent drunken party of Peter's favourite dwarf

			despite completing his lifework here, Falconet departed Russia a bitter, angry man. Years of arguing with the head of the Academy of Fine Arts over the finer details of the sculpture had taken its toll, and he didn’t even bother staying for the unveiling

	!!!
	for the most amazing first impression, walk from Nevsky pr, up Bolshaya Morskaya ul and under the triumphal arch	

	one of the most striking squares in the world
		in the centre of the square, the 47.5m Alexander Column was designed in 1834 by Montferrand. Named after Alexander I, it commemorates the 1812 victory over Napoleon

		square’s northern end is capped by the Winter Palace, a rococo profusion of columns, windows and recesses, topped by rows of larger-than-life statues. A residence of tsars from 1762 to 1917, it’s now the largest part of the State Hermitage Museum
		
		curving an incredible 580m around the south side of the square is the Carlo Rossi–designed General Staff Building completed in 1829. The east wing now houses a branch of the Hermitage while the west wing is the headquarters of the Western Military District. The two great blocks are joined by a triumphal arch over Bolshaya Morskaya ul, topped by the Chariot of Glory by sculptors Stepan Pimenov and Vasily Demuth-Malinovsky, another monument to the Napoleonic Wars

		Peter liked the place so much he built a villa, Monplaisir, here and then a whole series of palaces and ornate gardens
			
		after WWII, Peterhof was largely left in ruins. Hitler had intended to throw a party here when his plans to occupy the Astoria Hotel were thwarted. He drew up pompous invitations, which obviously incensed his Soviet foes. Stalin’s response was to pre-empt any such celebration by bombing the estate himself, in the winter of 1941–42, so it is ironic but true that most of the damage at Peterhof occurred at the hands of the Soviets. What you see today is largely a reconstruction; the main palace was completely gutted and only a few of its walls were left standing
		
		all the paintings, furniture and chandeliers are original, as everything was removed from the premises before the Germans arrived in WWII

		vast baroque palace, designed by Rastrelli and named after Peter the Great’s second wife. As at the Winter Palace, Catherine the Great had many of Rastrelli’s original interiors remodelled in classical style
			
		interiors are superb, with highlights including the Great Hall, the Arabesque Hall, the baroque Cavalier's Dining Room, the White State Dining Room, the Crimson and Green Pilaster Rooms, the Portrait Hall and, of course, the world-famous Amber Room

		panels used in Amber Room were a gift given to Peter the Great, but not put to any use until 1743 when Elizabeth decided to use them decoratively, after which they were ingeniously incorporated into the walls here. What you see is a reconstruction of the original that disappeared during WWII and is believed to have been destroyed
			original Amber Room was created from exquisitely engraved amber panels given to Peter the Great by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia in 1716. Rastrelli later combined the panels with gilded woodcarvings, mirrors, agate and jasper mosaics to decorate one of the rooms of the Catherine Palace. Plundered by the Nazis during WWII, the room’s decorative panels were last exhibited in Königsberg’s castle in 1941. Four years later, with the castle in ruins, the Amber Room was presumed destroyed
			
			in 2004 Putin and then German Chancellor Gerhardt Schröder presided over the opening of the new US$18 million Amber Room, restored largely with German funds

A GIFT TO YOUNG HOUSEWIVES
The most popular cookbook in 19th-century Russia was called A Gift to Young Housewives, a collection of favourite recipes and household management tips that turned into a bestseller. The author, Elena Molokhovets, a housewife herself, was dedicated to her 10 children, to the Orthodox Church, and to her inexperienced ‘female compatriots’ who might need assistance keeping their homes running smoothly.
This book was reprinted 28 times between 1861 and 1914, and Molokhovets added new recipes and helpful hints to each new edition. The last edition included literally thousands of recipes, as well as pointers on how to organise an efficient kitchen, how to set a proper table and how to clean a cast-iron pot.
Molokhovets received an enormously positive response from readers who credited her with no less than preserving their family life. The popular perception of the time was that a wife’s primary responsibility was to keep her family together, and keeping her husband well fed seemed to be the key. As one reader wrote, ‘A good kitchen is…not an object of luxury. It is a token of the health and well-being of the family, upon which all the remaining conditions of life depend’. Molokhovets included some of these letters in later editions as testimony to her work.
The classic cookbook was never reprinted during the Soviet period. The details of sumptuous dishes and fine table settings – let alone questions of etiquette and style – would certainly have been considered bourgeois by the Soviet regime. Yet still, copies of this ancient tome survived, passed down from mother to daughter like a family heirloom. Today, the book reads not only as a cookbook, but also as a lesson in history and sociology.


NA ZDOROVYE!
‘To your health!’ is what Russians say when they throw back a shot of vodka. But this pronouncement hardly suffices as a proper toast in a public forum or an intimate drinking session among friends. A proper toast requires thoughtfulness and sincerity.
A few themes prevail. The first toast of the night often acknowledges the generosity of the host, while the second usually recognises the beauty of the ladies present. In mixed company, you can’t go wrong raising your glass to international friendship (za mezhdunarodnuyu druzhbu) or world peace (za miravoy mir). But in all cases, the toast requires a personal anecdote or a profound insight, as well as a bit of rambling preamble to make it meaningful.
In Russia, drinking vodka is a celebration of life in all its complexity – the triumph, the tragedy and the triviality. A toast is a vocalisation of that celebration, so say it like you mean it. And drink it in the same way – zalpom – bottoms up!








Vasilyevsky Island

5Icebreaker Krasin Hearing tales of Soviet exploration in the Arctic aboard this retired icebreaker.

Explore Vasilyevsky Island
This large, triangular island is among the oldest neighbourhoods in St Petersburg, especially the eastern tip known as the Strelka (‘tongue of land’). Crammed with classical buildings housing institutions, excellent museums such as Menshikov Palace, and the sprawling campus of St Petersburg State University, this is the best place to start your exploration of the island.
Further back from the Strelka, Vasilyevsky Ostrov (or VO as it's commonly shortened to) is an orderly, residential place, with a grid system of wide roads lined with shops, restaurants and cafes. Make a beeline for the Russian Academy of Arts Museum, the historic St Andrew's Cathedral, the stunningly decorated Temple of the Assumption, and the compact Novy Museum showcasing late-20th-century art from the Soviet Union.
The northern and western ends of the island are rather post industrial and remote. Even so, there are things worth coming out this way to see, including the fantastic Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art, and the chance to tour around the Icebreaker Krasin and two submarines. Transport wonks will also be thrilled to find museums devoted to the city's metro and tram systems.
Local Life
ABridge Advice If you’re staying on Vasilyevsky Island, remember that in the summer months the bridges go up at night. Dvortsovy most's timetable is up at 1.10am and down for 20 minutes at 2.50am before going up again until 4.55am. Blagoveshchensky most is crossable from 2.45am until 3.10am and then not again until 5am.
ACool Street Hang with the locals on 6-ya and 7-ya liniya, the main pedestrian and commercial street of Vasilyevsky Island. Lined with cafes, bars, restaurants and shops, this is where to escape the tourist crowds at the Strelka.

Getting There & Away
AMetro The most useful metro stations are Vasileostrovskaya on Line 3 at the island’s heart and the nab Makarova/1-ya i Kadetskaya liniya exit from Sportivnaya on Line 5.
ABus The number 7 bus goes between Primorskaya to pl Vosstaniya, via Nalichnaya ul, all of Bolshoy pr and Nevsky pr. Trolleybus 10 and 11 run similar routes.
AMarshrutka From Vasileostrovskaya metro station, the following marshrutka buses zip to the far end of Sredny pr: K30, K44, K62 and K120.

LENGTH 2KM; TWO HOURS
The eastern nose of Vasilyevsky Island, the 1Strelka, boasts an unparalleled panorama, looking out over the Peter and Paul Fortress, the Hermitage, the Admiralty and St Isaac’s Cathedral. The red 2Rostral Columns frame the view; climb the steps of the 3Old Stock Exchange for a raised perspective.
Continue southwest, dropping into either the 4Museum of Zoology or the 5Kunstkamera, or both. The latter was Russia’s first museum, set up by Peter to dispel common superstitions about illness and disease and includes an infamous collection of deformed foetuses preserved in bottles.
At Peter’s behest, Domenico Trezzini built the magnificent 6Twelve Colleges, now St Petersburg State University, in 1722. The emperor based his bureaucracy here; separate entrances for each ministry signified their independence, while the unified facade highlighted collective goals. Now part of the university, you'll find here the small 7Mendeleev Museum, the beautiful university botanical gardens and a quirky collection of sculptures.
Peter originally gifted the entirety of Vasilyevsky Island to his best friend, Prince Menshikov, who proceeded to build the fabulous 8Menshikov Palace on the north bank of the Bolshaya Neva. Menshikov’s humble origins gave him a taste for opulence, and the interior is the best-preserved Petrine decor in the city.
Two Egyptian sphinx monuments mark the entrance to the institutional 9Academy of Arts Museum, which houses 250 years’ worth of artistic expression. On display are works created by academy students and faculty over the years, as well as temporary exhibitions. A beautiful old library – lined with dusty volumes and packed with dark wood furniture – is open for visiting researchers.
Head inland up 6-ya liniya i 7-ya liniya where you can pop briefly into the aPharmacy Museum of Dr Pelya to view the original 19th-century interior. Across Bolshoy pr, the street is pedestrianised and tree-lined, with the charming bSt Andrew's Cathedral on the corner. Enjoy something to eat along 6-ya liniya i 7-ya liniya before finally checking out the modern art of the cNovy Museum.










Petrograd & Vyborg Sides


Explore Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
Peter’s city was first founded on the Petrograd Side and it's a fascinating place packed with historical sites, stunning Style Moderne architecture and a couple of great live music venues. The showstopper of the area is the Peter & Paul Fortress, whose museums, soaring cathedral and panoramic views easily warrant a half- or a full-day visit. Afterwards, you could easily spend a few days taking in fascinating sights that see far fewer visitors such as the treasure-filled Hermitage Storage Facility and insightful house museums devoted to the likes of early 20th-century opera singer Chaliapin and Soviet party boss (and Stalinist victim) Kirov.
Aside from hitting the main sights, the Petrograd Side is a fine area for exploring. The main thoroughfare of Bolshoy pr is dotted with shops, restaurants and cafes, and you’ll find intriguing architecture scattered throughout the district. This area is also a fine destination when you need a break from the urban bustle. The wooded islands found here make a great retreat from the city streets, particularly Yelagin where you can hire boats and bicycles, and Krestovsky with its tree-lined lanes and sizeable amusement park.
Local Life
AParks If the weather’s good, join the locals as they take to the Kirovsky Islands for fairground rides, boating, sunbathing and cycling through the woods – it’s a total escape from the city, just three metro stops from the centre.
AStreet Art Check out the creative daubs of street artists on the walls around the shuttered Red Banner Textile Factory and the giant murals near Chkalovskaya metro.
AStrip off Stand next to the serious sunbathers tanning against the fortress walls or on the beach at Zayachy Island. For a year-round tropical holiday, splash around with crowds at Piterland water park.
Getting There & Away
AMetro The Petrograd Side is served by Gorkovskaya and Petrogradskaya on Line 2, and by Sportivnaya, Chkalovskaya and Krestovsky Ostrov on Line 5. The Vyborg Side has some 20 metro stations on it, mainly serving far-flung residential areas.
ABus Bus 10 runs from the Vyborg Side at Chyornaya Rechka, down Bolshoy pr on the Petrograd Side and on into the Historic Heart.
ATram Tram 6 provides a handy link between pl Lenina and Vasilyevsky Island via Kronverksky pr on the Petrograd Side, while tram 40 is also useful for traversing the Petrograd Side to Chyornaya Rechka.
AMarshrutka Marshrutka 346 runs the length of Bolshoy pr and then turns left onto Kamennoostrovsky pr and on to the Vyborg Side.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
This is the real St Petersburg – a far cry from the uniform beauty of the Historic Heart. The Petrograd Side is a good place to see the everyday life of the middle classes in the city and, while the Vyborg Side around pl Lenina is a vision of a post-industrial nightmare, your average Joes live in the Soviet housing estates further along the metro line – travel to the end of lines 1 or 2 and you’ll see real city life.

Architectural Tour of Petrograd Side

START PETER & PAUL FORTRESS (GORKOVSKAYA)
END ROSENSHTEIN APARTMENT BUILDING (PETROGRADSKAYA)
LENGTH 1.5KM; TWO HOURS
The Petrograd Side is an architectural treasure trove with buildings ranging from the time of St Petersburg's very inception up to contemporary times. Start with a quick tour of the city’s first defensive installation, the 1Peter & Paul Fortress. Don't miss the splendid 2SS Peter & Paul Cathedral, the last resting place of Peter the Great and almost every tsar since.
The central square of Peter’s early city, 3Troitskaya pl (Trinity Sq) formerly had as its centrepiece Trinity Cathedral, where Peter attended Mass. The cathedral was destroyed soon after the 1917 revolution but a small chapel remains on the spot.
Petrovskaya nab is home to two historic landmarks: 4Peter’s Cabin, the wooden hut that was the tsar's first modest home in the city; and, off the island’s eastern tip, the 5Cruiser Aurora, a legendary battleship which saw service in the Russo‑Japanese War.
Return to Kamennoostrovsky pr via ul Kuybysheva, passing the lovely Style Moderne palace of ballerina Mathilda Kshesinskaya that now houses the 6Museum of Political History, and the 7Mosque, coated in dazzling mosaics of aquatint tiles.
Continue north along Kamennoostrovsky pr to get a sense of Petrograd’s ever-growing vibrancy. Look closely for architectural gems around 8Avstriyskaya pl, with its castlelike edifices. Further along, if you want to get an idea of what one of these grand Style Moderne apartment blocks looks like inside, visit the 9Kirov Museum.
Ul Rentgena offers up more Style Moderne beauties: note the decoration on the facade of No 4 and make sure you do a full circle of the freestanding aChaev Mansion, which exhibits great geometric precision in its design.
Follow ul Lva Tolstogo towards the metro and you'll pass the whimsical, turretted bRosenshtein Apartment Building (also know as the Tower House). Designed by Andrey Belogrud, this mash-up of neoclassical and neo-Gothic styles now houses a theatre.

Transport
ARRIVING IN ST PETERSBURG

Pulkovo International Airport
Most travellers arrive in St Petersburg at Pulkovo International Airport (LED; GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 3822; www.pulkovoairport.ru; Pulkovskoye sh), 23km south of the city. This terminal building, which opened in 2014, and is confusingly still referred to as Terminal 1, handles all domestic and international flights and is St Petersburg's only airport.

Taxi
Taking a taxi from the airport to the city centre has never been easier or safer. Leave the terminal building and outside you'll find an official taxi dispatcher who will ask you for your destination's address, indicate which taxi to go to and write you a price on a slip of official paper that you can then give to your driver. Prices vary, but expect to pay between R800 and R1000 to reach the centre, depending on where exactly you’re headed. Drivers usually won’t speak much English, so just hand over the money on arrival – you don’t need to tip. It's also possible to book a trip into the city via a taxi app for around R700.

Marshrutka & Bus
For those on a budget, marshrutka (minibus) K39 shuttles you from outside the terminal building to the nearest metro station, Moskovskaya (R35, every five minutes, from 7am to 11.30pm). The bus terminates at the Moskovskaya metro station, so you don’t need to worry about where to get off, and you can connect to the rest of the city from there.
There's also bus 39 (R40, every 15 minutes, from 5.30am to 1.30am) that runs the same route over longer hours, but trundles along somewhat more slowly.

Moscow Station
If you’re arriving from Moscow, you’ll come to the Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal; Московский вокзал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.moskovsky-vokzal.ru; Nevsky pr 85; mPloshchad Vosstaniya) (Moskovsky vokzal), in the centre of the city. There are two metro stations close by: pl Vosstaniya (Line 1) and Mayakovskaya (Line 3). To get here (you can enter both stations through one building) turn left outside the main entrance to the Moscow Station, and the exit is in one side of the building on Ligovsky pr.




GETTING AROUND
Metro
The St Petersburg Metro (%8-800- 350 1155; www.metro.spb.ru; h6am-12.45am) is a very efficient five-line system. The network of some 70 stations is most usefully employed for travelling long distances, especially connecting the suburbs to the city centre. New stations are being added and it's possible that the one at Teatralnaya, next to the Mariinsky Theatre, will be operational by 2020.
Look for signs with a big blue ‘M’ signifying the entrance to the metro. The flat fare for a trip is R45; you will have to buy an additional ticket if you are carrying a significant amount of baggage. If you wish to buy a single journey, ask for ‘adin proyezd’ and you will be given a zheton (token) to put in the machine.
If you are staying more than a day or two, however, it’s worth buying a smart card (R60), which is good for multiple journeys to be used over the course of a fixed time period – for example, 10 trips in seven days for R355. Their main advantage is that you won’t have to line up to buy tickets – the ticket counters can have very long lines during peak hours.
The metro system is fully signed in English, so it’s quite easy to use, even for first-timers in Russia.

Bus, Marshrutka & Trolleybus
Buses, and particularly marshrutky (minibuses), are a very handy way to get around the city and they tend to cover routes that the metro doesn’t, making them essential for certain parts of town. Most travellers find taking them a bit daunting, however, as there’s little signage in English. On both buses and trolleybuses, you get on and then pay a conductor; the fare is R40.
Marshrutky can be flagged down anywhere along their route (there are no bus stops for marshrutky). Open the door yourself and jump in, then once you’ve taken your seat you pay the driver (pass the money via your fellow passengers if you’re not sitting within reaching distance); the rates are usually posted on the inside of the bus near the driver. You’ll also need to request the stop you want – usually announcing to the driver the name of the street or the place you’re going to shortly before you get there. Alternatively, when you want to get off, simply say (or shout!): ‘AstanavEEtye pazhalsta!’ ('Stop please!') and the driver will pull over as soon as possible.


BRIDGE TIMETABLE
From mid-April until late November major bridges across the Neva rise at the following times overnight to allow ships to pass through the city. It's rare that the Grenadersky, Kantemirovsky and Sampsonievsky Bridges over the Bolshaya Nevka River (connecting the Vyborg and Petrograd Sides) are raised and, if so, two days' notice is given beforehand. You can check the full, up-to-date timetable at www.razvodka-mostov.ru (in Russian only).
Because of the new fixed suspension bridges on the Western High Speed Diameter highway across the mouth of the Neva you will not be stuck either side of the river when the bridges go up. Note also that between May and the end of November the M5 metro line shuttles every 20 minutes back and forth between Admiralteyskaya and Sportivnaya stations between 1am and 3am on Saturday and Sunday and the eve of public holidays, creating an easy way to get between the islands and the Historic Heart.
