Alaverdi Cathedral
	8am-6pm
At the beginning of the 11th century, when Georgia was entering its cultural and political golden age, King Kvirike of Kakheti had a majestic cathedral built – at 50m tall, Alaverdi Cathedral remained the tallest church in Georgia for nearly a millennium. Situated 20km northwest of Telavi, its exterior is classically proportioned with majestic rounded arches but minimal decoration. Inside, the church has a beautiful spacious harmony, with light entering from 25 high slit windows.
Note the 16th-century St-George-and-dragon fresco over the west door. The Virgin and Child high in the apse is from the 11th century.
Also in the cathedral compound are the summer palace of Shah Abbas’ governor (now the bishop’s residence) and the Alaverdi Marani winery. The millennium-old winery, recently renovated, makes some of Georgia's best wines: it's not generally open to visitors but the cafe across the road sells bottles of traditionally made Alaverdi wine proudly bearing the slogan 'Since 1011', for a (by Georgian standards) whopping 75 GEL to 100 GEL.
The late-September religious-cum-grape-harvest festivities of Alaverdoba last several days, with people coming from remote mountain areas to worship, celebrate and enjoy the local wine.

!!!
Nekresi Monastery
MONASTERY
Nekresi’s early Georgian architecture and the views across the Alazani valley from its hillside-woodland site are marvellous. The monastery is 4km off the Kvareli road from a turning 10km past Gremi (Kvareli-bound marshrutky will drop you at the turn-off). Vehicles must park 1.5km before the monastery; from there marshrutky (1 GEL return trip) shuttle up and down the hill from about 9am to 5pm, approximately mid-April to mid-December.
Considerable repair and reconstruction has been done in recent years. The first church you come to is a three-church basilica from the 8th and 9th centuries, with a plan unique to early Georgian churches, the three naves being divided by solid walls into what are effectively three churches. Nekresi’s tiny first church (one of the earliest in Georgia, dating from the 4th century) stands in the centre of the complex. Beside it stands a 9th-century bishop’s palace, complete with wine cellar and a 16th-century tower. Immediately east is the main Church of the Assumption, another three-church basilica, from the 6th to 7th centuries, with 17th-century murals adorning its smoke-blackened interior.


!!!
Gremi Fortress
FORTRESS
(admission to tower 3 GEL; h9am-6pm Tue-Sun; p)
This picturesque brick citadel stands beside the Telavi–Kvareli road, 19km from Telavi. Kvareli-bound marshrutky will stop here. From 1466 to 1672 Gremi was the capital of Kakheti, but the town down to the west of the citadel was totally devastated by Shah Abbas in 1616. Within the citadel, the Church of the Archangels was built in 1565 by King Levan (who is buried inside) and contains frescoes from 1577. You can climb up inside the adjacent 15th-century tower-palace.
By the road below stands a large portrait of the Kakhetian Queen Ketevan, who was tortured to death by Abbas for refusing to renounce Christianity. A small roadside museum (admission 3 GEL; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun; p) contains explanatory panels on old Gremi, plus artefacts from the site.

oChavchavadze Estate
PALACE, GARDENS
(www.tsinandali.com/index_en.html; gardens 2 GEL, museum & park incl guide in Georgian, English or Russian 5 GEL, with tasting 1/several wines 7/20 GEL; h10am-7pm; p)
Prince Alexander Chavchavadze (1786–1846) was one of the most colourful and influential characters in Georgian history, and the palace and gardens he created at Tsinandali are a don't-miss stop on any Kakheti tour. The palace tour takes you around half a dozen rooms restored in 19th-century style and relates interesting episodes from the family story. The park is beautifully laid out in an English style, with venerable trees and exotic plants such as ginkgo, sequoia and yucca.
The multi-talented Chavchavadze was born into elite circles in St Petersburg as the son of Kakheti-Kartli's ambassador to Russia. He learned seven languages and was an influential Romantic poet and translator, helping to introduce European Enlightenment ideals to Georgia – as well as the grand piano, horse-drawn carriage and billiards. He rose to lieutenant-general in the Russian army but also joined Georgian rebellions against Russian rule (for which he spent time in exile). His homes at Tsinandali and in Tbilisi hosted illustrious visitors including writers Dumas, Pushkin, Lermontov and Griboedov – and he was a pioneer of European winemaking techniques in Georgia, helping to give Kakheti its current premier position in the Georgian wine world. (His famous cellars, containing 16,000 bottles, are being renovated for eventual opening for visits.)
In 1854 Lezgin tribesmen from Dagestan ransacked the Chavchavadze palace, kidnapping 23 women and children (what we see now is the house that was rebuilt after the Lezgin attack). Alexander’s son David had to mortgage the house to ransom the hostages. He was unable to repay the loan and the house passed to Tsar Alexander III.

Bodbe Convent
(h9am-6pm; p), the revered final resting place of St Nino, is set among tall cypresses 2km south of Sighnaghi, a pleasant walk on country roads. The little church was originally built, over the saint’s grave, by King Mirian in the 4th century. It has been rebuilt and renovated several times since. Nino’s tomb, partly silver-covered, with a bejewelled turquoise cloisonné halo, is in a small chapel in its southeast corner.
A steep path leads 800m down to a small chapel built over St Nino’s Spring, which reputedly burst forth after she prayed on this spot. Pilgrims queue up to drink and splash themselves with the holy water.

Walls
ARCHITECTURE
Most of Erekle II’s 4km defensive wall still stands, with 23 towers and each of its six gates named after a local village. Part of the wall runs along Chavchavadze on the hilltop on the northwest side of town, where you can enter the tiny Stepan Tsminda Church inside a tower. Another stretch runs down beside Gorgasali on the northeast side of town. Here you can climb up inside one tower and walk atop the walls down to two more.

good half-day walks to two waterfalls

!!!
Ninoskhevi waterfall





	

There is four tourist trails available. One day hiking: Black Grouse Waterfall (9km), Ninoskhevi Waterfall (Great Waterfall) (8km), Machi Fortress (3 km from the main road and village). The last trails is Black Rock Lake - 48 km, 3 days, horseback or hiking.








Recommend 4-5 hours for beginners. Bring water and snacks.
It took me 2.5 hours going to the waterfall and 1.5 hours coming down. Make sure your shoes are water proof and slip resistant.

This place is worth every second! When you get to the end of the paved road there is a little dirt road that you will need to drive up a just a little ways. Then you will see the trailhead. When we got there, there was a man there that explained to us the best he could that we would see route markers along the way. They are white and red .You'll see them painted on trees, rocks, etc. along the way. That being said, don't be surprised if you can't find any at certain points along your route. So long as you can hear and follow the river up you'll be just fine. 

We lucked out and had a local dog that did the entire hike with us, which ended up being extremely nice! He was a quick little thing, and when he'd get out of sight we would lose the path in unmarked areas, but he always came back and showed us the right way. Do yourself a favor and get there early enough to be the first ones there (we got there at 11) and let that dog lead you. He's a loyal one. Even when other people came up the trail (we only ever passed two other groups) he would hang out with them for a second and then come right back to us. 

The trail is very rocky, and you will get your feet wet. I would highly recommend water shoes like Chaco's. The rocks in the river are pretty slick, so just make sure you have shoes with traction. Like many others have said, there are parts towards the end where you are literally climbing boulders, so I'd bring a backpack if you were planning to carry anything with you so that all of your limbs are free. 

The hike to the falls took us about 2 hours and 15 minutes (we stopped a lot for pictures, and then again at a pool of water - which you can swim in, but mind you it is freezing in October). We hung out at the top for about 30 minutes and then did the hike down in about an hour and a half. The waterfall itself is absolutely breathtaking and highly worth every bit of effort it takes to get there!










	
	

Beautiful waterfall after a decent hike
We did the big waterfall hike as two not so experienced hikers on a warm July day. I would like to list some observations to take into account if you are doing this and are not too experienced as a hiker. 

-First of all, the hike is definitely worth the effort. The waterfall is breathtaking and very rewarding to see. 
-The path leads you through a lush green forest with nice and calm scenery and for most part it is shaded.
-At the start of the trail, there are very basic services. Do not count on getting what you need from the trailhead, if you did not bring it with you.
-We took a private taxi from Signagi straight to Lagodekhi trailhead for the big waterfall route. Cost was 90 GEL. The driver waited for us and drove us back to Signagi after we finished.
-We hiked about 2 h 15 mins to the waterfall, spent 15-20 minutes there and hiked about 2 hours back. 
-The route involves following a path with red-white, red and sometimes orange markings. In many places the markings were missing and it was easy to lose the way. However it was also easy to find the route again after some search. 
-There are no maps available, Google Maps or mobile data do not help you. 
-Following the path involved crossing and wading the river and streams several times. Path was blocked by fallen trees or continued on the other side. 
-River is not deep but wading makes you wet up to waist high and the current can be surprisingly strong.
-We wore long sleeve training clothes and good and light running shoes. This was helpful as some of the plants can scratch you. 
-I would recommend doing this on a dry day. The path was still wet, muddy and slippery even on a very warm day. 
-The route involves, towards the end, moderate rock climbing and some narrower trickier places
-We did it at a very relaxed pace, stopping only couple of times
-Carry as little as possible. Leave both hands free. It does not hurt to have your mobile/camera in a waterproof wrap in case of small accidents ;)
-Expect to get sweaty, wet and muddy

It was one of the nicest activities during our trip and well worth the effort. To put the real difficulty level in perspective, there were local families with small children doing the hike.












Beautiful hike to Gurgeniani/Ninoskhevi Waterfall
The hike to Gurgeniani waterfall (also known as the Big waterfall aka Ninoskhevi Waterfall) is a great one to take on within Lagodekhi Park. The waterfall itself is really beautiful, and the hike to get there is very pleasant. It travels alongside the river throughout and through very green and clean forest. This hike does not start at the main entrance to the park, but at the Gurgeniani entrance about 10 minutes' drive away. I'd say the hike is generally 'easy' but in August 2017, bridges were missing at several sections, which required us to remove our shoes and wade through the (quite strong) river, or to hoist yourself over some large boulders which required a fair amount of upper body strength to pull yourself over. Hiking boots are definitely not needed, but I'd recommend good running shoes, to help you keep your balance while scrambling over rocks, and to help support your feet as you will be walking quite a bit over the rocky banks of the river. It took us about 2.5 hours to get to the waterfall walking at a gentle pace, about 2 hours to get back. A few suggestions based on our experience: 
- Do pay attention to the trail markers, especially on the way back as it can be tricky to spot the actual trail in sections.
- Bring your bathing suit if you'd like to get into one of the pools at the base of the waterfall, or one of the smaller waterfalls/cascades along the hike. 
- Do wear sunscreen - while half of the hike is through shaded forest, if you're walking during the afternoon the sun can be quite strong.
- There are several clean springs as you get close to the waterfall (and at the waterfall itself) so it is possible to refill your water bottles for the return journey.
- Lastly, for safety I wouldn't recommend doing this hike alone, and if hiking in the mid-afternoon, making sure to turn around from the waterfall with plenty of time before sunset. We didn't meet anyone on our return journey and it would be easy to run into difficulty or to turn an ankle in the twilight.









SHORT VERSION:

taxi to lagodekhi from Tbilisi- 20 GEL appx, 2-3 hours.
TREKS in Lagodekhi National Reserve: small water fall, Big waterfull, and few more harder treks (take few days).
no need for guide, not payment at entrance when I visited there.
big waterfull- go alongside the river, sometimes on of the banks is blocked so you have to CROSS the river barefooted / on rocks. possible but A BIT EXTREME.

Time taken for whole trek: 6-10 hours (started about 9:00 finished about 17:00) .
nice guesthouse- Vashlovani in Lagodekhi. 
where to go next: Sighnaghi is pretty close (40 mins by taxi, about 10 GEL).

ENJOY and I hope this helped a bit.







The route starts from the Gurgeniani Information Center and follows the Ninoskhevi River on a narrow path. The sound of the river, the little waterfalls, huge stones, and cool breeze wandering through the valley make the trip both highly entertaining and adventurous. Take a few steps and magic scenery will spread in front of you – a 40 m long Ninoskhevi waterfall which is one of the most beautiful in Georgia. Its noise attracts the surroundings and sets a new dimension for viewers. On the way we come across rare relict plants such as Lagodekhiangentiana, Lagodekhian snowdrop, Julia purusula, bladdernut, wing nut, chestnut, Georgian oak and etc.

It is also possible to come across roe, deer, wild boar and birds of prey.
