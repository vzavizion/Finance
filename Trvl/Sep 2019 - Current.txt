		Novoslobodskaya is enveloped in the art-nouveau artistry of 32 stained-glass panels. Six windows depict the so-called intellectual professions: architect, geographer, agronomist, engineer, artist and musician. At one end of the central hall is the mosaic Peace in the Whole World. The pair of white doves was a later addition to the mosaic, replacing a portrait of Stalin
		Mayakovskaya is the pièce de résistance of the Moscow metro. The grand-prize winner at the 1938 World’s Fair in New York has an art-deco central hall that’s all pink rhodonite, with slender, steel columns. The inspiring, upward-looking mosaics on the ceiling depict 24 Hours in the Land of the Soviets. This is also one of the deepest stations (33m), which allowed it to serve as an air-raid shelter during WWII

Four Seasons Moscow (from outside)
	unusual Four Seasons Moscow exhibits two contrasting architectural styles, thanks to a funny fluke of history. The story goes that Stalin was shown two possible designs for the Hotel Moskva on Manezhnaya pl. Not realising they were alternatives, he approved both. The builders did not dare point out his error, and so built half the hotel in constructivist style and half in Stalinist style. The current building is a recreation of the 1935 original

		come back at night, when the crowds are gone and the lights cast a magical glow on the historic buildings
		
		
	Resurrection Gate aka Воскресенские ворота
		great vantage point for the first glimpse of the Red Square
		
		twin red towers topped by green tent spires, the original 1680 gateway was destroyed because Stalin thought it an impediment to the parades and demonstrations held in Red Square. This exact replica was built in 1995
		
		just outside the gateway is the bright Chapel of the Iverian Virgin, originally built in the late 18th century to house the icon of the same name		
		
	towers
		Saviour Gate Tower aka Спасская башня
			clock tower soaring above Red Square
			
			this gate – considered sacred – has been used for processions since tsarist times. The two white-stone plaques above the gate commemorate the tower’s construction in 1491. The current clock was installed in the gate tower in the 1850s. Hauling 3m-long hands and weighing 25 tonnes, the clock takes up three of the tower’s 10 levels. Its melodic chime sounds every 15 minutes across Red Square			
			
		Tsar Tower
			legend has it that Ivan the Terrible watched executions and other Red Square activities from the old wooden tower that previously stood on this site
			
		Alarm Tower aka Набатная башня
			used to house the Spassky Alarm Bell, used to warn of enemy attacks and to spur popular uprisings. After quashing one such uprising, Catherine the Great was so outraged that she had the clapper removed from the bell, so it could sound no more		

	Place of Skulls aka Лобное место
		13m circular stone platform in front of St Basil's Cathedral is known as the Place of Skulls. Legend has it that it was the site of executions; in reality, it was a stage for tsarist decrees and religious ceremonies
			
				

	
!!!
Alexander Garden aka Александровский сад
	first public park in Moscow		
		back in the 17th century, the Neglinnaya River ran through the present gardens, with dams and mills along its banks. When the river was diverted underground, the garden was founded by architect Osip Bove, in 1821
		
	impressive Kremlin views
	
	every hour on the hour, the guards of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier perform a perfectly synchronised ceremony to change the guards on duty

	obelisk in Alexander Garden has been restored to its original purpose, as a monument to the House of Romanovs, originally erected to commemorate the tercentenary of the royal family's rule. In 1918 it had a dramatic change in mission when it was recast as a monument to honour 'outstanding thinkers in the struggle for the liberation of workers'. Nearly 100 years later – revolutionary thinking no longer deserving of memorialising – a replica of the original Romanovsky obelisk was restored, this time to celebrate the Romanovs' 400th anniversary

			main visitors’ entrance

			stands apart from the Kremlin’s west wall, at the end of a ramp over the Alexander Garden. The ramp was once a bridge over the Neglinnaya River and used to be part of the Kremlin’s defences; this river has been diverted underground, beneath the Alexander Garden, since the early 19th century. The Kutafya Tower is the last of a number of outer bridge towers that once stood on this side of the Kremlin

		Troitskaya Tower aka Trinity Gate Tower
			pass through the Kremlin walls

			from the Kutafya Tower, walk up the ramp and pass through the Kremlin walls beneath the 1495 Trinity Gate Tower. At 80m it's the tallest of the Kremlin’s towers. Right below your feet were the cells for prisoners in the 16th century
	
	!!!	
	Armoury aka Оружейная палата
		highlight of any visit to the Kremlin
		
		housed in Great Kremlin Palace
		dates back to 1511, when it was founded under Vasily III to manufacture and store weapons, imperial arms and regalia for the royal court, also produced jewellery, icon frames and embroidery		
		during the reign of Peter the Great all craftspeople, goldsmiths and silversmiths were sent to St Petersburg, and the Armoury became a mere museum storing the royal treasures

		tour - 1hr
			tour starts upstairs, where the first two rooms house gold and silver from the 12th to 20th centuries, many of which were crafted in the Kremlin workshops. There's jewellery, dishes and sacred items crafted from precious metals and jewels
			
			in Room 2, you'll find the renowned Easter eggs made by St Petersburg jeweller Fabergé. The tsar and tsarina traditionally exchanged these gifts each year at Easter. Most famous is the Grand Siberian Railway egg, with gold train, platinum locomotive and ruby headlamp, created to commemorate the Moscow–Vladivostok line
			
			following rooms display armour, weapons and more armour and more weapons. Don’t miss the helmet of Prince Yaroslav, the chainmail of Boris Godunov, and the sabres of Minin and Pozharsky
			
			downstairs in Room 6, you can see the coronation dresses of 18th-century empresses (Empress Elizabeth, we’re told, had 15,000 other dresses). Look for Catherine the Great's wedding gown, which is covered with silver brocade (note the 43cm waist size!). Other 'secular' clothing is also on display, including an impressive pair of boots that belonged to Peter the Great
			
			following room contains some impressive furniture, including the 800-diamond throne of Tsar Alexey. The most unusual item, perhaps, is the joint coronation throne of boy tsars Peter the Great and his half-brother Ivan V (with a secret compartment from which Regent Sofia prompted them). In the same room, you'll see the glittering and fur-lined crowns of the emperors through the ages. The gold Cap of Monomakh, jewel-studded and sable-trimmed, was used for two centuries at coronations

			end your tour in Room 9, which houses centuries’ worth of royal carriages and sledges. One of the oldest is the luxurious carriage that was a gift from King James of England to Boris Godunov in 1604. Look also for the sleigh in which Elizabeth rode from St Petersburg to Moscow for her coronation, pulled by 23 horses at a time – about 800 in all for the trip
	
	Diamond Fund aka Алмазный фонд		
		can be skipped as Armoury also has diamond exposition		
			managed by the Ministry of Finance, which retains a monopoly on the mining and sale of precious stones. As such, the collection includes many magnificent raw diamonds, some in excess of 300 carats
		security is super tight and you are not allowed to bring cameras, phones or bags of any sort
		dates back to 1719, when Peter the Great established the Russian Crown treasury
			bulk of the exhibit is gemstones and jewellery garnered by tsars and empresses
				190-carat diamond given to Catherine the Great by her lover Grigory Orlov
				Great Imperial Crown, encrusted with 4936 diamonds, was the coronation crown of Catherine the Great and successive rulers
		
	???
	Patriach's Palace and Church of the Twelve Apostles
		mostly built in the mid-17th century for Patriarch Nikon, whose reforms sparked the break with the Old Believers
		highlight is the ceremonial Cross Hall (Крестовая палата), where the tsar’s and ambassadorial feasts were held. From the 18th century the room was used to produce miro (a holy oil used during church services, which contains over 30 herbal components); the oven and huge pans from the production process are on display
		palace now contains an exhibit of 17th-century household items, including jewellery, hunting equipment and furniture
		from here you can access the five-domed Church of the Twelve Apostles, which has a gilded, wooden iconostasis and a collection of icons by leading 17th-century icon painters
		
	Assumption Cathedral aka Успенский собор
		focal church of prerevolutionary Russia
			striking 1660s fresco of the Virgin Mary faces Sobornaya pl, above the door once used for royal processions
		if you have limited time, come straight here
		visitors entrance is at the western end
		
		history
			In 1470 Russian architects Krivtsov and Myshkin were commissioned by Ivan the Great to replace the old dilapidated cathedral, which dated from 1326. As soon as the ceiling was put up, one of the walls collapsed. Krivtsov and Myshkin lost their jobs, and Italian architect Aristotle Fioravanti was given a crack at it. After the foundation was completed, Fioravanti toured Novgorod, Suzdal and Vladimir to acquaint himself with Russian architecture. His design is a more spacious version of the Assumption Cathedral at Vladimir, with a Renaissance twist
			
			in 1812 French troops used the Assumption Cathedral as a stable; they also looted 295kg of gold and over 5 tonnes of silver from here, but much of it was recovered

			church closed in 1918. According to some accounts, in 1941, when the Nazis were on the outskirts of Moscow, Stalin secretly ordered a service in the cathedral to protect the city from the enemy. The cathedral was officially returned to the Church in 1989, but it now operates as a museum

		frescoes & murals
			The interior of the Assumption Cathedral is unusually bright and spacious, full of frescoes painted in warm golds, reds and blues. The west wall features a scene of the Apocalypse, a favourite theme of the Russian Church in the Middle Ages. The pillars have pictures of martyrs, considered to be the pillars of faith. Above the southern gates there are frescoes of Yelena and Constantine, who brought Christianity to Greece and the south of Russia. The space above the northern gate depicts Olga and Vladimir, who brought Christianity to the north.
			
			Most of the existing images on the cathedral walls were painted on a gilt base in the 1640s, with the exception of three grouped together on the south wall: The Apocalypse (Апокалипсис), The Life of Metropolitan Pyotr (Житие Митрополита Петра) and All Creatures Rejoice in Thee (О тебе радуется). These are attributed to Dionysius and his followers, the cathedral’s original 15th-century mural painters.

		Throne of Monomakh
			Near the south wall, the tent-roofed wooden throne is known as the Throne of Monomakh. It was made in 1551 for Ivan the Terrible. Its carved scenes highlight the career of 12th-century Grand Prince Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev – considered to be Ivan's direct predecessor.

		Iconostasis
			iconostasis dates from 1652, but its lowest level contains some older icons. The 1340s Saviour with the Angry Eye (Спас Ярое око) is second from the right. On the left of the central door is the Virgin of Vladimir (Владимирская Богоматерь), an early-15th-century Rublyov-school copy of Russia’s most revered image, the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God (Владимирская икона Богоматери). The 12th-century original, now in Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery, stood in the Assumption Cathedral from the 1480s to 1930. One of the oldest Russian icons, the 12th-century red-clothed St George (Святой Георгий) from Novgorod, is by the north wall.

			The original icons of the lower, local tier are symbols of victory brought from Vladimir, Smolensk, Veliky Ustyug and other places. The south door was brought from the Nativity of the Virgin Cathedral in Suzdal.		

	Archangel Cathedral
		coronation, wedding and burial church of tsars
		built by Ivan Kalita in 1333 to commemorate the end of the great famine, and dedicated to Archangel Michael, guardian of the Moscow princes		
		
		tombs of almost all Muscovy’s rulers from the 1320s to the 1690s are here. The only absentee is Boris Godunov, whose body was taken out of the grave on the order of a ‘False Dmitry’ and buried at Sergiev Posad in 1606. The bodies are buried underground, beneath the 17th-century sarcophagi and 19th-century copper covers. Tsarevitch Dmitry (a son of Ivan the Terrible), who died mysteriously in 1591, lies beneath a painted stone canopy. It was Dmitry’s death that sparked the appearance of a string of impersonators, known as False Dmitrys, during the Time of Troubles. Ivan’s own tomb is out of sight behind the iconostasis, along with those of his other sons, Ivan (whom he killed) and Fyodor I (who succeeded him). From Peter the Great onwards, emperors and empresses were buried in St Petersburg, the exception being Peter II, who died in Moscow and is here.

		some 17th-century murals were uncovered during restorations of the Archangel Cathedral in the 1950s. The south wall depicts many of the rulers buried here; on the pillars are some of their predecessors, including Andrei Bogolyubsky, Prince Daniil and Alexander Nevsky		
		
	Annunciation Cathedral aka Благовещенский собор
		royal family’s private chapel
			under Orthodox law, the fourth marriage of Ivan the Terrible disqualified him from entering the church proper, so he had the southern gallery of the Annunciation Cathedral converted into the Archangel Gabriel Chapel, from where he could watch services through a grille
		impressive murals in the gallery			
			many murals in the gallery date from the 1560s. Among them are Capture of Jericho in the northern porch, Jonah and the Whale in the northern arm of the gallery and the Tree of Jesus on its ceiling. Other frescoes feature ancient philosophers such as Aristotle, Plutarch, Plato and Socrates holding scrolls inscribed with their own wise words. Socrates’ scroll reads: ‘No harm will ever come to a good man. Our soul is immortal. After death the good shall be rewarded and the evil punished.' Plato’s says: ‘We must hope God shall send us a heavenly Teacher and a Guide’.
		central chapel features the celebrated icons of master painters Theophanes the Greek and Andrei Rublyov
		small central part of the cathedral has a lovely jasper floor
		iconostasis
			real treasure - in the 1920s restorers uncovered early-15th-century icons by three of the greatest medieval Russian artists. It was most likely Theophanes who painted the six icons at the right-hand end of the biggest row of the six tiers of the iconostasis. From left to right, these are the Virgin Mary, Christ Enthroned, St John the Baptist, the Archangel Gabriel, the Apostle Paul and St John Chrysostom. Theophanes was a master of portraying pathos in the facial expressions of his subjects, setting these icons apart from most others.
			third icon from the left, Archangel Michael, is ascribed to Andrei Rublyov, who may also have painted the adjacent St Peter. Rublyov is also reckoned to be the artist of the first, second, sixth and seventh (and probably the third and fifth) icons from the left end of the festival row, above the deesis (biggest) row. The seven icons at the right-hand end are attributed to Prokhor of Gorodets
		archaeology exhibit in the basement
			remnant of the 14th-century church that previously occupied this site. On display are hundreds of artefacts – glassware, ceramics, tools and woodwork – that were excavated from Borovitsky Hill in the 1960s and 1970s
			
	Sobornaya pl
		every Saturday at noon from April to October, the Presidential Regiment shows up on Sobornaya pl for a ceremonial procession, featuring some very official-looking prancing and dancing, both on foot and on horseback			
	
	Ivan the Great Bell Tower
		before the 20th century it was forbidden to build any higher in Moscow
		climb the 137 steps to the top for sweeping views
			45-minute audio tour ends with a 137-step climb to the top of the tall tower, yielding an amazing (and unique!) view of Sobornaya pl, with the Church of Christ the Saviour and the Moskva-City skyscrapers in the distance
		
		in 1505, Italian Marco Bono designed a new belfry, originally with only two octagonal tiers beneath a drum and a dome. In 1600 Boris Godunov raised it to 81m (local legend says that this was a public works project designed to employ the thousands of people who had come to Moscow during a famine)

The bell was cooling off in the foundry casting pit in 1737 when it came into contact with water, causing an 11-tonne chunk to break off.

	History
		A 'kremlin' – or fortified stronghold – has existed on this site since Moscow’s earliest years. In 1147 Yury Dolgoruky summoned his allies to this spot, which would have been occupied by a wooden fort. When the city became the capital of medieval Rus in the 1320s, the Kremlin served as the headquarters of the Russian Orthodox Church and the seat of the prince
		
		The ambition of Ivan III (the Great) was to build a capital that would equal the fallen Constantinople in grandeur, power, achievements and architecture. In an effort to build the ‘Third Rome’, Ivan brought from Italy stonemasons and architects, who built new walls, three great cathedrals and other structures. Most of the present-day buildings date from this period
			
		Although Peter I (the Great) shifted the capital to St Petersburg, the tsars still showed up here for coronations and other celebrations. The fortress was captured by Napoleon, who inflicted serious damage before making his retreat in 1812. But still the ancient symbol endured. The citadel wouldn’t be breached again until the Bolsheviks stormed the place in November 1917

St Basil’s Cathedral

	R400
	audio guide R200
	
	11am-6pm


	in 1552 Ivan the Terrible captured the Tatar stronghold of Kazan on the Feast of Intercession. He commissioned this landmark church, officially the Intercession Cathedral, to commemorate the victory
	
	official name of St Basil’s Cathedral is the Intercession Cathedral. The misnomer ‘St Basil’s’ refers to the extra northeastern chapel, which was built over the grave of Vasily (Basil) the Blessed
	
	legend has it that Ivan had the architects blinded so that they could never build anything comparable. This is a myth, however, as records show that they were employed a quarter of a century later (and four years after Ivan’s death) to add an additional chapel to the structure
	
	out front of St Basil’s is a statue of Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky, one a butcher and the other a prince, who raised and led the army that ejected occupying Poles from the Kremlin in 1612

	
	Don't miss
		Church of St Vasily the Blessed
		Portals from the vestry to the central church
		Icon of the Old Testament Trinity
		Icon of the Life of St Alexander Nevsky

		
	Exterior
		cathedral’s apparent anarchy of shapes hides a comprehensible plan of nine main chapels
		
		tall, tent-roofed tower in the centre houses the namesake Church of the Intercession of the Mother of God

		four biggest domes top four octagonal-towered chapels
			Church of Sts Cyprian & Justina
			Church of the Holy Trinity
			Church of the Icon of St Nicholas the Miracle Worker
			Church of the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem
			
			there are four smaller chapels in between, each consecrated in honour of an event or battle in the struggle against Kazan
		
		onion domes were originally green, most likely acquiring their characteristic colours and patterns during an 18th-century restoration
	
	
	Church of St Vasily the Blessed
		The Church of St Vasily the Blessed, the northeastern chapel on the ground floor, contains the canopy-covered crypt of its namesake saint, one of the most revered in Moscow. Vasily (Basil) the Blessed was known as a 'holy fool', sometimes going naked and purposefully humiliating himself for the greater glory of God. He was believed to be a seer and miracle maker, and even Ivan the Terrible revered and feared him. This 10th chapel – the only one at ground level – was added in 1588, after the saint's death. Look for the icon depicting St Vasily himself, with Red Square and the Kremlin in the background

	Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God
		The tall, tent-roofed tower in the centre of the cathedral houses the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God. The ceiling soars to nearly 47m. Some of the walls have been restored to their original appearance (a painted red-brick pattern), while others show off fragments of oil murals that were painted later. From the vestry, the doorways into this central chapel are among the most elaborate architectural elements in the cathedral, gorgeously embellished with tile and brickwork

	Church of the Holy Trinity
		With whitewashed walls and a spiralling symbol of eternity painted in the vault, the light-filled Church of the Holy Trinity is a favourite. A gorgeous 16th-century chandelier is suspended from the 20m ceiling. But the gem of the room is the unusual iconostasis. The 16th-century Icon of the Old Testament Trinity in the third tier is among the oldest and most esteemed pieces of artwork in the cathedral

	Church of St Cyprian & St Justina
		The colourful Church of Sts Cyprian & Justina is adorned with oil paintings depicting the lives of the 4th-century saints, as well as Biblical stories. At 20m, the vault in the dome depicts the Mother of God of the Burning Bush. The paintings and the iconostasis date to the end of the 18th century

	Church of the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem
		This chapel is dedicated to the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem, also known in Orthodoxy as Willow Sunday. At 23m, this is one of the tallest towers in the cathedral. Whitewashed walls (as originally painted) show off the architectural elements. Above the northern entrance, you can see the scar left by a shell that hit the wall in October 1917. The iconostasis was moved from the Cathedral of St Alexander Nevsky in the Kremlin in 1770. One of the most sacred and revered pieces in the cathedral is the 17th-century icon of the Life of St Alexander Nevsky, which depicts 33 scenes from the saint's life

		decorative panel on the hotel’s central facade, facing Teatralny proezd, is based on a sketch by the artist Mikhail Vrubel
			depicts the legend of the Princess of Dreams, in which a troubadour falls in love with a kind and beautiful princess and travels across the seas to find her. He falls ill during the voyage and is near death when he finds his love. The princess embraces him, but he dies in her arms. Naturally, the princess reacts to his death by renouncing her worldly life. The ceramic panels were made at the pottery workshop at Savva Mamontov’s estate in Abramtsevo
			
		ceramic work on the side of the hotel facing Teatralnaya pl is by the artist Alexander Golovin. The script was originally a quote from Nietzsche: ‘Again the same story: when you build a house you notice that you have learned something’. During the Soviet era, these wise words were replaced with something more appropriate for the time: ‘Only the dictatorship of the proletariat can liberate mankind from the oppression of capitalism’. Lenin, of course

	history
		Catherine the Great, one of the greatest art collectors of all time, began the collection. Nicholas I also greatly enriched it and opened the galleries to the public for the first time in 1852

		it was the post-revolutionary period that saw the collection increase threefold, as many valuable private collections were seized by the state, including those of the Stroganovs, Sheremetyevs and Yusupovs. In 1948 it incorporated the renowned collections of post-Impressionist and Impressionist paintings of Moscow industrialists Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov

		
	visiting
		five linked buildings along riverside Dvortsovaya nab (from west to east):
			Winter Palace aka Зимний дворец
				stunning mint-green, white and gold profusion of columns, windows and recesses, with its roof topped by rows of classical statues, was commissioned from Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1754 by Empress Elizabeth. Catherine the Great and her successors had most of the interior remodelled in a classical style by 1837. It remained an imperial home until 1917, though the last two tsars spent more time in other palaces
			
			Small Hermitage aka Малый Эрмитаж
				used by Catherine the Great as a retreat and to house the art collection started by Peter the Great, which she significantly expanded
						
			Great (Old) Hermitage aka Большой (Старый) Эрмитаж
				mainly houses Italian Rennaissance art including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Giorgione, Titian, Botticelli, Caravaggio and Tiepolo

			New Hermitage aka Новый Эрмитаж
				built for Nicholas II in 1852, to hold the growing art collection and as a museum for the public. Designed by German neoclassicist architect and painter von Klenze, the historically preserved rooms house the museum's collections of ancient art, European paintings, sculptures and decorative art

			Hermitage Theatre
				once the private theatre of the imperial family, and stands on the site of the original Winter Palace of Peter I

			!!!
			rooms 151–189: Russian Culture & Imperial Apartments

				huge collection from ancient Rus (10th to 15th centuries) through to the 18th century, including artefacts, icons, portraits and furniture

				private apartments of the last tsar, Nicholas II, and the imperial family
					rooms were completed in 1894, and they now show off elaborate 19th-century interiors
					
				Rooms 151 & 153 
					long corridor, broken up by a vast clock, contains portraits of all the Russian tsars from Peter the Great to Nicholas II

				Rooms 155–156
					Moorish Dining Room and Rotunda

				Rooms 157–162 
					Petrovsky Gallery displays personal effects and equipment used by Peter the Great, as well as some beautiful early-18th-century furniture. Look for the ivory chandelier that was partly built by Peter himself
					
				Room 161
					In 1880 there was an attempt on the life of Alexander II in this room. A young revolutionary, Khalturin, planted a bomb in the room below. It killed 11 soldiers when it went off, although the tsar had wandered into another room at the time
					
				Room 178
					Nicholas II spent much of his time in this wonderful Gothic library, topped with a sublime walnut ceiling

				Room 181
					relatively small and intimate Pompeii dining room
					
				Room 187 
					griffin-motif furniture in this palace drawing room dates from 1805
					
				Room 188 
					small dining room where the Provisional Government was arrested by the Bolsheviks in 1917
					
				Room 189 
					Two tonnes of gorgeous green columns, boxes, bowls and urns have earned this room the name ‘Malachite Hall’, and it is one of the most striking rooms in the entire palace. The handiwork of architect Alexander Bryullov, it was completed in 1839. Three figurines on the wall represent Day, Night and Poetry. This was where the last meeting of the 1917 Provisional Government occurred, on the fateful nights of 25 and 26 October 1917; they were arrested soon after, in the Small Dining Room next door.

					
			rooms 190–192: Neva Enfilade
				three grand ceremonial halls often used for temporary exhibitions

				Room 190
					this Concert Hall was used for small soirées. The enormous ornate silver tomb was commissioned by Empress Elizabeth for the remains of Alexander Nevsky
					
				Room 191
					as many as 5000 guests could be entertained in the Great Hall (also called Nicholas Hall). The palace’s largest room was the scene of imperial winter balls

				Room 192
					this anteroom was used for pre-ball champagne buffets
					

			rooms 193–198: Great Enfilade
				more state rooms here

				Room 193
					Field Marshals’ Hall is known for its military-themed chandelier and its portraits of seven of Russia’s military leaders

				Room 194
					Hall of Peter the Great contains his none-too-comfy throne.

				Room 195
					gilt Armorial Hall contains chandeliers engraved with the coat-of-arms of all the Russian provinces

				Room 197
					1812 War Gallery is hung with 332 portraits of Russian and allied Napoleonic war leaders

				Room 198
					St George’s Hall served as the state rooms where the imperial throne used to sit. With white Carrara marble imported from Italy and floors crafted from the wood of 16 different tree species, it is a splendid affair

					
			!!!
			room 204: Pavilion Hall & Hanging Garden
					ceremonial Pavilion Hall is an airy white-and-gold room sparkling with 28 chandeliers and the famous Peacock Clock (centrepiece of the Pavilion Hall)
						incredible Peacock Clock, created by James Cox and gifted to Catherine the Great in 1781 by Grigory Potemkin. A revolving dial in one of the toadstools tells the time: as it strikes the hour the automaton peacock spreads its wings and the toadstools, owl and cock come to life. A video beside the clock shows the action in close-up detail should you not be around for the once-weekly performance at 7pm on Wednesday
					
					south windows look on to Catherine the Great’s hanging garden (built over the stables), while the north overlooks the Neva. The amazing floor mosaic in front of the windows is a copy of that in the Roman bath of Otricoli (Ocriculum) near Rome

				
			!!!
			rooms 207–238: Italian Art
				highlights are certainly the works by the Renaissance artists: Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Giorgione and Titian. Look also for Botticelli, Caravaggio and Tiepolo
				
				???
				Room 207
					earliest example in this collection is The Crucifixion, painted by Ugolino di Tedice in the second half of the 13th century				

				!!!
				Room 214
					of a dozen or so original paintings by da Vinci that exist in the world, two are here. The very different Benois Madonna (1478) and Madonna Litta (1490) are named after their last owners. For years, the latter was considered lost. However, in 1909, the Russian architect Leon Benois surprised the art world when he revealed that it was part of his father-in-law’s collection

				!!!
				Room 217
					Giorgione is one of the most mysterious painters of the Renaissance, as only a few paintings exist that are known for certain to be his work. A portrait of idealised beauty, Judith is said to represent the inseparability of life and death

				!!!
				Room 221
					the work of Titian, the best representative of the Venetian school during the 16th century, is featured here: Danaya and St Sebastian are widely accepted as two of his masterpieces

				!!!
				Room 224				
					accessed off this room is the Hermitage Theatre; there are lovely views from the connecting corridor over the Neva

				!!!
				Rooms 226–227: Loggia of Raphael
					when Catherine the Great visited the Vatican she was so impressed that she commissioned Quarenghi to create this copy of a Vatican gallery; a team of Raphael’s students recreated the master’s murals on canvas. Note the occasional Russification on these versions: the two-headed eagle of the Romanov dynasty replaces the papal coat-of-arms

				!!!
				Room 229
					here you’ll enjoy two pieces by Raphael, The Holy Family and Madonna and Child, as well as many pieces by his disciples

				!!!
				Room 230
					the Hermitage’s only piece by Michelangelo, a marble statue of a crouching boy

				!!!
				Rooms 237–238 
					these Italian Skylight Halls are bathed in natural light, which highlights the ornately moulded ceilings
					

			???
			rooms 239–240: Spanish Art
				collection includes the most noteworthy artists of this ‘Golden Age’ of Spanish painting: Murillo, Ribera and, of course, Velázquez
				
				collection also includes two remarkable paintings from the 16th century: the marvellous St Peter and St Paul, by El Greco, and St Sebastian Cured by St Irene, by Ribera

								
			room 243: Knights’ Hall
				Nicholas I started collecting artistic weapons and armaments from around the world. Here is the Western European collection, featuring four impressive 16th-century German knights sitting atop their armoured horses

				
			???
			rooms 245–247: Flemish Art
				dedicated to 17th-century Flanders are almost entirely consumed by three artists: Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony Van Dyck and Frans Snyders.

				
			!!!
			rooms 249–254: Dutch Art
				Dutch collection contains more than 1000 pieces
				
				Room 254
					26 paintings by Rembrandt in Room 254 nearly outshine anything else in these rooms. The collection traces his career, starting with Flora and The Descent from the Cross, which are noticeably lighter but more detailed. His later work tends to be darker and more penetrating, such as the celebrated The Return of the Prodigal Son. Painted between 1663 and 1665, it arguably represents the height of Rembrandt’s mastery of psychology in his paintings. The solemn baroque masterpiece is a moving portrait of unquestioning parental love and mercy
				

			???
			rooms 263–268: German Art
				small collection of German art ranges from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Among the earliest works here are five paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder.

				
			!!!
			room 271: Great Church
				this Rastrelli-designed chapel is one of the Winter Palace's most dazzling spaces, with a white and gilt dome and the ceiling painting The Ascension of Christ by Pyotr Basin

				
			???
			rooms 272–288 & 290–297: French Art & Interiors
				these rooms trace the development of French art from the 15th to the 18th centuries, including tapestries, ceramics, metalwork and paintings. Look for rooms devoted to Nicholas Poussin, founder of French classicism, and Claude Lorrain, master of the classical landscape. Room 282, Alexander Hall, is a testament to the victory over Napoleon in 1812.


			???
			rooms 298–301: British Art
				these rooms showcase 15th- to 18th-century British art
				
				highlights:
					Room 298
						Portrait of a Lady in Blue, by Thomas Gainsborough, perhaps the most famous piece in the English collection
					Room 300
						The Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpents by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which was commissioned by Catherine the Great to symbolise the growing strength of Russia.

		Rooms 5–7: Petrine & Post-Petrine Art
			Room 6 
				some charmingly odd canvases in very strange shapes as well as mosaic portraits of both Peter and Catherine the Great, as well as of Elizabeth I, Peter’s daughter. The centre of the room is taken up by a huge portrait of the ill-fated Peter III, but look out for the impressive bust of Prince Menshikov
				
			Room 7 
				amazingly ornate ceiling. The room houses a sculpture of Empress Anna with an Arab Boy and a few impressive tapestries, including one that depicts Peter the Great at the Battle of Poltava, his greatest military victory

		Rooms 8–11: Rise of the Academy
				early works of the St Petersburg Academy of Arts. These artists borrowed the European classical aesthetic for their work

				Room 11 
					Rossi-designed White Hall, which was Grand Duke Mikhail’s drawing room. Here, the interior is the art – in this case representing the Empire epoch. It’s wonderfully ornate and shiny – a perfect place to host musical greats like Strauss and Berlioz, who performed here

					Vladimir Borovikovsky’s magnificent Catherine II Promenading in Tsarskoe Selo and his Portrait of Murtaza Kuli, his picture of the brother of the Persian Shah
					
				Room 13 
					full of paintings of peasant subjects with uplifting titles such as Peeling Beetroot.

				!!!
				Room 14
					truly spectacular, including enormous canvases such as Karl Bryullov’s incredible The Last Day of Pompeii and The Crucifixion, and Ivan Aivazovsky's terrifying The Wave
					
				Room 15 
					impressive, with the far wall made up of studies for Alexander Ivanov’s masterpiece The Appearance of Christ Before the People (1837–57), which hangs in Moscow’s Tretyakov Gallery. Ivanov spent 20 years on this work, but it was met with a negative critical reception. However, later generations appreciated the work, and even these studies, many of which mark a notable departure in terms of detail and representation

			Room 22 
				huge rendition of Pugachev's Judgement by Vasily Perov.
				
			
		???
		Rooms 23–24: The Wanderers
			works by the Wanderers (Peredvizhniki), a group of Academy artists who saw their future outside the strict confines of that institution. They wandered among the people, painting scenes of realism that had never been seen before in Russian art. Prime examples include Nikolai Perov's animated Hunters at Rest and the Monastery Refectory, a scathing critique of the Church establishment's greed. Also keep an eye out for Pavel Christiakov's serene Jovannina Sitting on Window Sill.

		
		???		
		Rooms 25 & 26: Konstantin Makovsky & Nicholas Ghe
			Room 25 
				devoted to Konstantin Makovsky (1839–1915), who painted the incredibly cinematic Festivity During the Carnival on Admiralty Sq in St Petersburg at the age of just 30. Also a standout is his portrait of his wife Julija

			Room 26
				Ghe’s masterpiece, Peter I Interrogating Tsarevich Alexey in Peterhof, along with other dark Ghe works such as The Last Supper
				
		???
		Rooms 27–32: Landscapes & Portraits
			landscape artists such as Ivan Shishkin were still popular. These rooms also document the rise of populist art, which had a strong social conscience and sought to educate the public. Examples of this are Konstantin Savitsky’s To War (Room 31) and Grigory Myasoyedov's lyrical Harvest Time

			Room 28 
				pause to take in the talent of Ukrainian artist Marie Bashkirtseff (1858–84) who died young but not before painting striking portraits, such as Umbrella and the Three Smiles series

		
		Rooms 33–34: Ilya Repin
			Barge Haulers on the Volga 
			Cossacks Writing a Letter to the Turkish Sultan
			marvellous portrait of a barefoot Leo Tolstoy.

		Rooms 66–71: Early-20th-Century Art
			2nd floor of the Benois Wing
			
			Room 66
				works by the father of modern Russian art, Mikhail Vrubel. Some of his groundbreaking works include Epic Hero (Bogatyr) and Flying Demon				
				
			Rooms 67 to 71 
				works by an array of important early-20th-century painters including Nikolai Sapunin, Mikhail Nesterov and Boris Kustodiev, whose Merchant’s Wife at Tea is perhaps the most well-known picture here
				
		!!!
		Rooms 72–78: Russian Avant-Garde Painting
			
			Room 72 
				home to Nathan Altman’s gorgeous, semi-cubist Portrait of the Poetess Anna Akhmatova, painted in 1914, and it remains one of his most famous works even though Akhmatova apparently didn’t care for it herself. In the same room is Altman’s striking Self Portrait (1911)
				
			Room 74 
				contains primitivist paintings by artist couple Natalya Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov
				
				
			Rooms 75 to 76
				futurism and suprematism, including works by Malevich such as Black Square and Vladimir Tatlin's Counter Relief
				
			Room 77 
				devoted to constructivism and features works by Alexander Rodchenko and Vladimir Lebedev
			
			Room 78
				displays the bright, ethereal work of Pavel Filonov

		Rooms 80–81: Early Soviet Art
			paintings from the Stalin era
			

		???
		Rooms 82–86: Late Soviet Art
			with Stalin gone and the ‘thaw’ under way in the 1950s, Soviet art recovered somewhat from the severity of socialist realism. Idealised images of rural life and peasants still feature very strongly, however. Look for Alexei Sundukov's Queue which captures the failed economy of the times and Dmitry Zhilinsky's The Artist's Family, showing several generations of a family
			
						
		Rooms 87–94: Applied & Decorative Art
			Works in these galleries range from a beautifully glazed ceramic fireplace by Mikhail Vrubel and other art nouveau–inspired pieces, to Soviet-era porcelain and textiles printed with ingenious patterns made out of tiny tractors or planes
			
			
		Rooms 101–109: Temporary Exhibitions
			to reach these from the 1st floor of the Benois Wing (following your tour of the museum's main collection), use the stairs down off rooms 91 and 92

		Impressionists & Post-Impressionists
		
			inspired by romanticism, a group of painters in the 1860s began experimenting with painting modern life and landscapes, endeavouring to capture the overall effect of a scene instead of being overly concerned with details. The new trend – radical in its time – was known as Impressionism
		

			arguably the best collection in the world of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings
				much of this artwork was displayed for the first time in the 1990s, when the museum revealed some fabulous pieces, kept secret since seizure by the Red Army from Germany at the end of WWII

		Barbizon School
			next to Room 452 is a series of unnumbered rooms displaying works from the Barbizon School, named for the village in France where this group of artists settled.

		!!!
		Russian Avant-Garde
			Room 444
				couple of Kandinsky’s early works
				Kazimir Malevich's Black Square (1915), the most striking painting of the Petrograd avant-garde
					
					Malevich created several variants of the simple black square against a white background throughout his career, of which this is the fourth and last. It was taken by many as a nihilistic declaration of the ‘end of painting’, causing both awe and outrage
					
					Black Square went missing during the Soviet period, mysteriously reappearing in southern Russia in 1993. Oligarch Vladimir Potanin bought the painting for $US1 million and donated it to the Hermitage in 2002.


		!!!
		20th Century
			Rooms 430 to 440
				over 40 paintings by Matisse and almost as many by Picasso
					
					Henri Matisse was initially classified as a Fauvist, but he continued to paint in his own particular style, even as Fauvism declined in the early 20th century. Around this time, Matisse met Pablo Picasso and the two became lifelong friends. Picasso is best known as the founder and master of cubism, but again his work spanned many styles.

					A turning point for Matisse – and perhaps his most famous work – is The Dance (1910). The intense colours and the dancing nudes convey intense feelings of freedom. This panel – along with the accompanying The Music – was painted specifically for Russian businessman Sergei Shchukin. While these panels are certainly commanding, don’t miss The Red Room and Portrait of the Artist’s Wife.

					Picasso’s blue period is characterised by sombre paintings in shades of blue. When he was only 22, he painted The Absinthe Drinker, a haunting portrait of loneliness and isolation. The sensuous Dance of the Veils (1907) and Woman with a Fan (1908) are excellent representations of his cubist work, as are the ceramics on display here.

		French architect Auguste de Montferrand began designing the cathedral in 1818. Due partly to technical issues, it took so long to build (until 1858) that Nicholas I was able to insist on an even more grandiose structure than Montferrand had originally planned. More than 100kg of gold leaf was used to cover the 21.8m-high dome alone, while the huge granite pillars on the building’s facade each weigh over 120 tonnes. There’s a statue of Montferrand holding a model of the cathedral on the west facade, although Nicholas I denied the architect his dying wish, to be buried here, considering it too high an honour for a mere artisan

The tradition of tsars giving their wives jewelled Easter eggs began in 1885 when Alexander III commissioned the 37-year-old Fabergé to create a present for his Danish wife Maria Feodorovna. From 1897, the new tsar Nicholas II asked the jeweller to continue making the eggs for his mother, now the Dowager Empress, and his own wife Alexandra Feodorovna

	branch of the Hermitage
	
	built to the grandiose tastes of Prince Alexander Menshikov, Peter the Great’s closest friend and the first governor of St Petersburg
		interiors are some of the oldest and best preserved in the city
		St Petersburg’s first stone building.


	Menshikov was of humble origins (he is said to have sold pies on the streets of Moscow as a child), but his talent for both organisation and intrigue made him the second-most important person in the Russian Empire by the time of Peter’s death in 1725. His palace, built mainly between 1710 and 1714, was the city’s smartest residence at the time (compare it to Peter the Great’s tiny Summer Palace across the river). Peter used Menshikov's palace for official functions
	
	the 1st floor displays some stunning Dutch tile work, intended to fortify the rooms against humidity to help ease Menshikov’s tuberculosis. Original furniture and the personal effects of Menshikov are on display and each room has a fact sheet in English explaining its history. Vavara’s Chamber is particularly evocative of how the aristocracy lived during Peter’s time, while the impressive Walnut Study also stands out

	also of note is the magnificent Grand Hall, where balls and banquets were held, including the infamous reception for Peter's dwarf wedding, in which Peter and his court sniggered as some 70-odd dwarfs from all over Russia attended the wedding and the subsequent drunken party of Peter's favourite dwarf

			despite completing his lifework here, Falconet departed Russia a bitter, angry man. Years of arguing with the head of the Academy of Fine Arts over the finer details of the sculpture had taken its toll, and he didn’t even bother staying for the unveiling

		after WWII, Peterhof was largely left in ruins. Hitler had intended to throw a party here when his plans to occupy the Astoria Hotel were thwarted. He drew up pompous invitations, which obviously incensed his Soviet foes. Stalin’s response was to pre-empt any such celebration by bombing the estate himself, in the winter of 1941–42, so it is ironic but true that most of the damage at Peterhof occurred at the hands of the Soviets. What you see today is largely a reconstruction; the main palace was completely gutted and only a few of its walls were left standing

8Getting There & Away
It’s easy and cheap to reach Peterhof by bus or marshrutka. Marshrutka 300, 424 and 424A (R80) leave from outside the Avtovo metro station, while marshrutka 103 leaves from outside Leninsky Prospekt station. All pass through the town of Peterhof, immediately outside the palace. Tell the driver you want to go ‘vo dvaryéts’ (‘to the palace’) and you’ll be let off near the main entrance to the Upper Garden, on Sankt-Peterburgsky pr.
There’s also a reasonably frequent suburban train (R60, 40 minutes) from Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) to Novy Peterhof, from where you can walk (around 30 minutes), or take any bus except 357 to the fifth stop, which will take another 10 minutes.
From May to September, the Peterhof Express ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhof-express.com; single/return adult R800/1500, student R600/1000; h10am-6pm) hydrofoil departs from the jetty in front of the Admiralty every 30 minutes from 9am. It’s an expensive but highly enjoyable way to get to Peterhof, and you arrive right in front of the palace. The last hydrofoil leaves Peterhof at 7pm, and the trip takes 30 minutes.




OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
ORANIENBAUM ОРАНИЕНБАУМ aka Lomonosov
Oranienbaum (Orange Tree), the palace of Peter the Great's right-hand man Alexander Menshikov is 5km down the coast from Peterhof. The buildings are part of the Unesco World Heritage Site, and provide a fine window into Russia’s imperial past. The surrounding park (Музей-заповедник Ораниенбаум GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhofmuseum.ru; h9am-8pm) is worth a visit in its own right, with beautifully landscaped paths amid the lakes and greenery.
!
Menshikov’s impressive palace (Большой Меншиковский Дворец GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R400/250; h10.30am-6pm Wed-Mon) underwent a full restoration and reopened its state rooms in 2014. Most of the interiors are restorations of the 19th century ones, so reflect the taste of the various Romanovs who used the palace, rather than Menshikov himself, of whom there is no trace.
!
Among the other buildings in the park open to the public is the Chinese Palace (Китайский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun). Built for Catherine the Great as her private residence at Oranienbaum, this over-the-top rococo palace, designed by Antonio Rinaldi, is distinctly un-Chinese looking and, in fact, gets its name from its chinoiserie interiors, which feature painted ceilings and fine inlaid-wood floors and walls.
???
Opposite Oranienbaum's main entrance, Okhota (Охота GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovy pr 65a; mains R480-1220; hnoon-9pm Mon-Thu, to midnight Fri-Sun) serves up hearty fare in a traditional Russian environment. It's big on taxidermy for its hunting-themed decor.
Trains from St Petersburg’s Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) to Peterhof continues to Oranienbaum (R81, one hour). Get off at Lomonosov Station and walk diagonally across the little park in front, keep going up to the main road, turn right, pass the unmissable Archangel Michael Cathedral, and you’ll reach the park entrance on your left. Alternatively you can take marshrutky 300, 424 or 424A to Lomonosov (R70) from outside metro Avtovo. Get off at the Archangel Michael Cathedral and follow the park perimeter to the left until you reach the entrance.




Pushkin (Tsarskoe Selo) Пушкин (Царское Село)
%812 / POP 106,100
The grand imperial estate of Tsarskoe Selo in the town of Pushkin, 25km south of St Petersburg, is often combined on a day trip with the palace and sprawling park at Pavlovsk, 4km further south. It’s a great combination, but start out early as there’s lots to see: Pushkin can easily be a full-day trip in itself.
The railway that connects Pushkin and Pavlovsk with St Petersburg was Russia’s first, opened in 1837 to carry the imperial family between here and the then capital. The town changed its name to Pushkin in 1937 after Russia’s favourite poet, who studied here and whose school and dacha you can also visit. While the palace and park complex's name has reverted to Tsarskoe Selo (The Tsar's Village), the town remains proudly named for the national bard.

(Екатерининский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tzar.ru; Sadovaya ul 7; adult/student R1000/350, audio guide R150; h10am-4.45pm Wed-Sun)
The centrepiece of Tsarskoe Selo, created under Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine the Great between 1744 and 1796, is the vast baroque Catherine Palace, designed by Rastrelli and named after Peter the Great’s second wife. The palace can only be visited by individuals between noon and 2pm, and 4pm and 4.45pm, otherwise it's reserved for pre-booked tour groups, such is its rightful popularity. The audio guide is well worth taking, as it gives detailed explanation of what you'll see in each room.
As at the Winter Palace, Catherine the Great had many of Rastrelli’s original interiors remodelled in classical style. Most of the gaudy exterior and 20-odd rooms of the palace have been beautifully restored – compare them to the photographs of the devastation left by the Germans.
The interiors are superb, with highlights including the Great Hall, the Arabesque Hall, the baroque Cavalier's Dining Room, the White State Dining Room, the Crimson and Green Pilaster Rooms, the Portrait Hall and, of course, the world-famous Amber Room. The panels used in the latter were a gift given to Peter the Great, but not put to any use until 1743 when Elizabeth decided to use them decoratively, after which they were ingeniously incorporated into the walls here. What you see is a reconstruction of the original that disappeared during WWII and is believed to have been destroyed.

Near the Catherine Palace, the Cameron Gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h11am-6pm) normally has rotating exhibitions. Between the gallery and the palace, notice the south-pointing ramp that Cameron added for the ageing empress to walk down into the park.
The park’s outer section focuses on the Great Pond ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ). In summer you can take a ferry to the little island to visit the Chesme Column ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R250/150; h11am-6pm May-Sep). Beside the pond, the blue baroque Grotto Pavilion ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h10am-5pm Fri-Wed) houses temporary exhibitions in summer. A walk around the Great Pond will reveal other buildings that the royals built over the years, including the very incongruous-looking Turkish Bath ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; R200; h11am-6pm Thu-Tue Jun-Sep), with its minaret-style tower, the wonderful Marble Bridge, the Chinese Pavilion ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), and a Concert Hall ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; tickets R500) isolated on an island, where concerts take place every Saturday at 5pm.

oAlexander Palace
PALACE
(Александровский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovaya ul 2)
The classical Alexander Palace, built by Quarenghi between 1792 and 1796 for the future Alexander I, is surrounded by the charming Alexander Park. Nicholas II, the last Russian tsar, was its main tenant and he made it his residence for much of his reign.
The palace is currently undergoing renovation and is closed to the public, with completion due in 2018 at the earliest.

THE MYSTERY OF THE AMBER ROOM
The original Amber Room was created from exquisitely engraved amber panels given to Peter the Great by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia in 1716. Rastrelli later combined the panels with gilded woodcarvings, mirrors, agate and jasper mosaics to decorate one of the rooms of the Catherine Palace. Plundered by the Nazis during WWII, the room’s decorative panels were last exhibited in Königsberg’s castle in 1941. Four years later, with the castle in ruins, the Amber Room was presumed destroyed. Or was it?
In 2004, as Putin and then German Chancellor Gerhardt Schröder presided over the opening of the new US$18 million Amber Room, restored largely with German funds, rumours about the original panels continued to swirl. There are those who believe that parts, if not all, of the original Amber Room remain hidden away (see www.amberroom.org). The mystery gained traction in February 2008 as attention focused on the possible contents of an artificial cavern discovered near the village of Deutschneudorf on Germany’s border with the Czech Republic. Nothing conclusive has yet been unearthed here, though, so the mystery continues.

8Getting There & Away
From Moskovskaya metro station, take the exit marked ‘Buses for the airport’, and then pick up marshrutka 286, 299, 342 or K545 towards Pushkin (R40). These buses all continue to Pavlovsk (R50). Look for Пушкин or Дворец on the buses.
Suburban trains run from Vitebsk Station (Vitebsky vokzal) in St Petersburg, but they’re infrequent except for weekends. For Pushkin, get off at Detskoe Selo (Детское село, R47, 30 minutes) and for Pavlovsk (R54, 40 minutes) at Pavlovsk Station (Павловск). From Detskoe Selo station, marshrutky (R25) frequently run the 500m or so to Tsarskoe Selo.




Pavlovsk Павловск
%812 / POP 16,200
Less visited than better known Pushkin to the east, Pavlovsk is nevertheless home to a stunning 18th-century royal palace and one of the finest green spaces in greater St Petersburg. It's well worth tacking on a visit here to explore the artfully designed interiors – and a small but first-rate collection of old-world masterpieces – followed by a stroll amid the verdure of Pavlovsk park.
Between 1781 and 1786, on orders from Catherine the Great, architect Charles Cameron designed the Great Palace in Pavlovsk. The palace was designated for Catherine’s son Paul (hence the name, Pavlovsk), and it was his second wife, Maria Fyodorovna, who orchestrated the design of the interiors. It served as a royal residence until 1917. Ironically, the original palace burnt down two weeks after WWII when a careless Soviet soldier’s cigarette set off German mines (the Soviets blamed the Germans). As at Tsarskoe Selo, its restoration is remarkable.

One of the most tragic and mysterious characters in the Romanov royal family, emperor Paul I was intensely disliked by his own courtiers, who eventually strangled him with a scarf. Whatever historians say about him, however, he had great taste, as displayed in this glorious palace, the finest rooms of which are on the middle floor of the central block.
Charles Cameron designed the round Italian Hall beneath the dome and the Grecian Hall to its west, though the lovely green fluted columns were added by his assistant Vincenzo Brenna. Flanking these are two private suites designed mainly by Brenna – Paul’s along the north side of the block and Maria Fyodorovna’s on the south.
The Hall of War of the military-obsessed Paul contrasts with Maria’s Hall of Peace, decorated with musical instruments and flowers. On the middle floor of the south block are Paul’s Throne Room and the Hall of the Maltese Knights of St John, of whom he was the Grand Master.

Shaped in a graceful curve around a central turret, the Gatchina Great Palace certainly lives up to its name – its enormous (if surprisingly plain) facade is quite a sight to behold, overlooking a vast parade ground and backing onto the huge landscaped grounds. Built by Rinaldi between 1766 and 1781 in an early classicism style for Catherine the Great’s favourite Grigory Orlov, the palace curiously combines motifs of a medieval fortress with elements commonly seen in Russian imperial residences.
It’s hard to call it beautiful, but there’s no doubt that it’s extremely impressive. After Orlov’s death in 1783, Catherine the Great bought the palace from his heirs and gifted it to her son Paul, who redesigned the exterior between 1792 and 1798.
Inside, the 10 state rooms on the 2nd floor are impressive, including Paul I’s throne room, hung with huge tapestries, and his wife Maria Fyodorovna’s throne room, the walls of which are covered in paintings. Most impressive of all is the White Hall, a Rinaldi creation from the 1770s that was redone by Brenna in the 1790s. On the balcony is an impressive collection of sundials.
Admission covers entry to the palace and all three pavillions in the grounds.

Gatchina Park is more overgrown and romantic than the other palaces’ parklands. The park has many winding paths through birch groves and across bridges to islands in the large White Lake. Look out for the frankly bizarre Birch House (Березовый домик GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R50/20; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun May-Sep), which was a present from Maria Fyodorovna to Paul I. With a rough facade made of birch logs, the interior is actually very refined, with a beautiful hardwood floor made from timber from around the world.

5Eating
There is a cafe in the Grand Palace and a couple of simple cafes in the grounds, but as the place was made for picnicking, your best bet is to bring your own lunch. If you haven’t done so, however, there are a couple of decent options spread out along pedestrianised ul Sobornaya.

Kafe Piramida
RUSSIAN$
(Кафе Пирамида GOOGLE MAP ; ul Sobornaya 3a; mains R255-380; h10am-11pm)
Serving a wide range of traditional Russian dishes as well as pizza, plus delicious cakes and coffees, this cosy place is near the Pavlovsk Cathedral. It's poorly signposted, but is handily located just off pr 25 Oktyabrya.

???
Chasy
RUSSIAN$$
(Часы GOOGLE MAP ; http://cafe-watch.ru; ul Sobornaya 7; mains R450-980; h10am-midnight)
Hands-down Gatchina's best eatery, Chasy is a friendly spot for grilled meats and seafood, and sushi. It's also a fine afternoon spot for a pot of tea and dessert. Look for the clock over the entrance (more timepieces lie within).

8Getting There & Away
The quickest way to get to Gatchina is by bus. Bus K18, K18A and 431 (R100, 45 minutes) run this route from outside Moskovskaya metro station and stop right by the park. Bus 100 (R100, one hour) also runs regularly from Moskovskaya; buses wait outside the massive House of Soviets and stop just short of Gatchina Park. Tell the driver you want to go to the palace (‘v dvaryéts’) – the bus turns off before you get to the park.
There are trains to Gatchina Baltiysky (R102, one hour) from St Petersburg's Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) every one to two hours. The train station is directly in front of the palace.




Kronshtadt Кронштадт
%812 / POP 43,000
With its grand cathedral, waterfront parks and pretty canal-lined avenues, Kronshtadt makes for a fascinating half-day visit. Aside from taking in one grand neo-Byzantine church and visiting a little-visited corner of greater St Petersburg, this is a fine place for seeing Russia’s mighty naval centre, and getting an overview of the bay on a boat tour.
Within a year of founding St Petersburg, Peter – desirous of protecting his new Baltic toehold – started work on the fortress of Kronshtadt on Kotlin Island, 29km out in the Gulf of Finland. It’s been a pivotal Soviet and Russian naval base ever since, and was closed to foreigners until 1996.
In 1921 the hungry and poor Red Army sailors stationed here organised an ill-fated mutiny against the Bolsheviks. They set up a Provisional Revolutionary Committee and drafted a resolution demanding, among other things, an end to Lenin’s harsh War Communism. On 16 March 1921 the mutineers were defeated when 50,000 troops crossed the ice from Petrograd and massacred nearly the entire naval force. The sailors’ stand wasn’t entirely in vain, as afterwards Lenin did scrap War Communism.

1Sights & Activities
!!!
Naval Cathedral
CHURCH
(Морской собор GOOGLE MAP ; Yakornaya pl; h9am-6.30pm)
Kronshtadt’s key sight is the unusual and beautiful Naval Cathedral. Built between 1903 and 1913 to honour Russian naval muscle, this neo-Byzantine wonder stands on Yakornaya pl (Anchor Sq), where you’ll also find an eternal flame for Kronshtadt’s sailors, and the florid art nouveau monument of Admiral Makarov.
The cathedral underwent a thorough renovation for its centennial celebrations and is now looking breathtaking, both inside and out. Its 75m-high cupola is the highest point in town, and its enormous interior makes its use as a cinema during the Soviet period rather logical.

ReeperbahnCRUISE
( GOOGLE MAP ; %821-382 0888; Middle Harbour; adult/student R550/400; hdepartures 1.30pm, 3.30pm & 5.30pm May-Sep)
From the Middle Harbour beside Petrovsky Park, you can take cruises to various forts around the island, including Fort Konstantin. Several companies offer cruises, including Reeperbahn, with three daily departures in summer.

5Eating
Cafe KashtanRUSSIAN$
(Кафе Каштан GOOGLE MAP ; pr Lenina 25; mains R300-500; h11am-11pm)
The entrance to this charming little place is actually on ul Andreevskaya, a side-street of the main shopping street, pr Lenina. It's friendly and has a wide selection of pub fare as well as coffee and desserts like tiramisu.
Bolshaya CherepakhaRUSSIAN$$
(Большая Черепаха GOOGLE MAP ; www.big-turtle.com; ul Karla Libknekhta 29; mains R400-750; h11am-11pm)
One of Kronshtadt's better restaurants, the 'Big Turtle' serves up salads, spaghetti with seafood, perch fillet with vegetables, and grilled meats. With decent beers on tap, it's also a fine spot for an afternoon drink. It's located a short stroll from the Naval Cathedral – cross the main bridge and continue up Roshalya, where you'll see it on the right.

8Getting There & Away
Catch bus 101 to Kronshtadt from Staraya Derevnya metro station (R40, 40 minutes). Upon exiting the metro, turn hard left and then walk past the marshrutky and trams until you come to a second bus park where the 101 bus begins and ends its route. Alternatively take marshrutka 405 from Chyornaya Rechka station (R80, 40 minutes); exit the station to your left and cross the street to find the stop.
Vehicles heading back to St Petersburg depart from both sides of the large ‘Dom Byta’ on the corner of ul Grazhdanskaya and pr Lenina. From there it’s about a 1km walk southeast to the Naval Cathedral.
With the completion of St Petersburg's ring road, it's now possible to reach Kronshtadt from Oranienbaum, meaning it's perfectly feasible to combine a trip here with a visit to one of the Tsarist palaces.

WORTH A TRIP
REPINO РЕПИНО
Come summer, Petersburgers stream out of the city to relax on the beaches to the north between Sestroretsk and Zelenogorsk on the Gulf of Finland. Between these two towns you’ll find the village of Repino, 45km from St Petersburg. From 1918 to the end of WWII, this area was part of Finland and the village was known as Kuokkala. In 1948, back in Russian hands, the village was renamed in honour of its most famous resident, Ilya Repin.
Penaty (Пенаты GOOGLE MAP ; %812-432 0828; www.nimrah.ru; Primorskoe Shosse 411; adult/student R300/200; hmuseum 10.30am-6pm Wed-Sun, grounds 10.30am-8pm Wed-Mon), the artist's home in his later years, is preserved as a museum. Repin bought land here in 1899, named the estate after a Roman household god and designed the light-flooded house in an arts-and-crafts style. Several of Repin's paintings still hang on the walls and the furnishings have been left just as they were during his residence, which was up to his death in 1930. His grave, marked by a simple Russian Orthodox wooden cross, is in the surrounding park, along with a couple of wooden follies also designed by Repin.
While here also visit the nearby Beach Laskovy (Пляж Ласковый GOOGLE MAP ) and stop for a meal at either Skazka ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-432 1251; www.skazkarepino.ru; Primorskoe Shosse 415; mains R570-1490; h11am-11pm; W), which has an attractive dining room with big picture windows and a terrace – both fine spots for enjoying its nicely executed dishes– or Penaty (Пенаты GOOGLE MAP ; %812-432 1125; Primorskoe Shosse 411A; mains R400-850; h10am-10pm), which serves a good range of Russian dishes and offers a pleasant flower-trimmed terrace.
The easiest way to get to Repino is to take the frequent marshrutky 400 (R105, one hour) that leave from near Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal) – cross ul Komsomola, and look for the stop on the right side of pl Lenina. You can also catch bus 211 (R90, one hour) from beside Chyornya Rechka metro station. Be sure to tell the driver that you want to get out at Penaty.



Leningrad Region Ленинградская область
If you have more time, there are several other places in the Leningrad region that can be seen in a day trip or longer from St Petersburg. These including the charming old Finnish town of Vyborg, the sleepy village of Staraya Ladoga and the monastery town of Tikhvin.

Vyborg
%81378 / POP 78,500 / TIME MOSCOW
This appealing Gulf of Finland provincial town is dominated by a medieval castle and peppered with beautiful Finnish art-nouveau buildings and romantic cobblestone streets. An important port and rail junction, Vyborg is 174km northwest of St Petersburg and just 30km from the Finnish border. It has just about enough to do to justify staying over, but is also an easy day trip from St Petersburg.
The border has jumped back and forth around Vyborg for most of its history. Peter the Great captured it from the Swedes in 1710. A century later it fell within autonomous Finland, and after the revolution Vyborg remained part of independent Finland. Since then the Finns have called it Viipuri. Stalin took Vyborg in 1939, lost it to the Finns during WWII, and on getting it back at the end of the war deported all the Finns. Today the Finns are back by the coachloads for sightseeing and carousing on the weekends.
1Sights
With the exception of Park Monrepo, all Vyborg’s main sights are neatly arranged around a compact peninsula, making it an ideal town to explore on foot.
Apart from the castle, other relics of Vyborg’s Swedish times are found in the squat Round Tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Rynochnaya), which now houses a restaurant; the remains of the 15th-century Town Hall (Башня Ратуши MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Vyborgskaya 15), with its distinctive white tower crowned with what resembles a giant metallic wizard’s hat; and the Clock Tower (Часовая башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Krepostnaya 5), dating to 1490.

oVyborg Castle
HISTORIC BUILDING
(Выборгский замок MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Zamkovy Island; grounds free, museum R100; hgrounds 9am-7pm daily, exhibitions 10am-6pm)
Rising stoutly from an islet in Vyborg Bay, this castle was built by the Swedes in 1293 when they first captured Karelia from Novgorod. Most of it now consists of 16th-century alterations. The castle contains several exhibition halls, including a mildly diverting small museum ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; R100; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun) on local history, but the main attraction is climbing the many steps of whitewashed St Olaf’s Tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) for commanding views over the town (closed for renovations at time of research).

oHermitage VyborgMUSEUM
(Эрмитаж Выборг MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Ladanova 1; adult/student R250/150; h10am-6pm)
Housed in a wing of a striking building designed by Finnish architect Uno Ulberg in 1930, this small museum hosts themed exhibitions that are curated from the Hermitage’s massive collection and change every six months. The functional white building, which sits in the middle of an old defensive bastion, is shared with Vyborg’s arts school, which also has a gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Ladanova 1; h10am-6pm Mon-Fri) with regularly changing exhibitions.

A must-see for architecture fans is the beautifully designed public library, one of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto's iconic designs. After years of restoration, the 1935 building looks lovelier than ever, with painstaking efforts to return it to Aalto's original vision. Handmade bronze-handled doors, circular skylights in the reading room, and elegant birchwood shelves are among the many features. It's still a working public library, open to all (though oddly, it lacks wi-fi).

oRussky DvorRUSSIAN$$
(Русский Двор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %81378-26 369; ul Shturma; meals R400-720; hnoon-midnight)
The terrace overlooking the castle and town is an ideal spot to enjoy some traditional Russian dishes like venison with berry sauce. The chef cures his own salmon and you can drink their delicious homemade honey and horseradish kvas (fermented rye-bread water). The high-ceilinged castle-like interior is also impressive, though sometimes ruined by blaring Russian pop music.
VkusEUROPEAN$$
(Вкус MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %81378-52 823; nab 40-letiya Komsomola; mains R430-1395; hnoon-midnight)
On the top floor of the Victoria Hotel, Vkus serves up Italian fare like risotto, lasagna and caprese salad, as well as spicy rack of lamb and other filling plates. With wonderful views from the small outdoor deck, Vkus is a fine spot for a drink – though the coffee isn't up to par.
Round Tower RestaurantRUSSIAN$$
(Круглая башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rynochnaya pl 1; mains R420-850; hnoon-midnight, to 2am Fri & Sat)
On the top floor of a 16th-century tower, this atmospheric and long-running place is a reliable option for traditional Russian cuisine, although it can sometimes be booked out by tour groups.

BOAT
ASaimaa Travel (www.saimaatravel.fi) arranges visa-free cruises (one/two days from €63/118 per person) from Lappeenranta in Finland to Vyborg.
BUS
Services to/from St Petersburg (R280, to/from either metro stations Devyatkino or Parnas) run every 20 minutes from 6.30am to 8pm. Theoretically, travel time is around 2¼ hours, but the traffic can lengthen this, so the train remains the best option.
TRAIN
Elektrichki (R301, 2½ hours, hourly) leave from St Petersburg’s Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal). Of these, there are also a handful of express services (R331, 1¼ hours, four daily), or the far more expensive Helsinki-bound trains, which stop in Vyborg (R2236, one hour).



Staraya Ladoga
%81363 / POP 3200 / TIME MOSCOW
Although you’d hardly guess it now, this tranquil village, 125km east of St Petersburg on the winding banks of the Volkhov River, lays claim to being Russia’s first capital. The idea of this place being a 'capital' of anywhere is quite extraordinary, though, and today you’ll find an ancient fortress, several churches and some prettily painted wooden cottages. It makes for a pleasant escape from St Petersburg, particularly in summer, when a swim in the river adds to the charm.
The town was known simply as Ladoga until 1704, when Peter the Great founded Novaya (New) Ladoga to the north as a transfer point for the materials arriving to build St Petersburg. Protected as a national reserve, the town’s basic layout has remained virtually unchanged since the 12th century, give or take a few ugly Soviet blocks.

RUSSIA’S ANCIENT CAPITAL
Just as the origins of Rus are continually debated, so is Staraya Ladoga’s status as ‘Russia’s first capital’. Nevertheless, its age (historians have given 753 as the village’s birth date) and significance remain uncontested.
When the Scandinavian Viking Rurik, along with his relatives Truvor and Sineus, swept into ancient Russia in 862, he built a wooden fortress on the Volkhov River and made this his base. Rurik is depicted in a colourful mosaic on the side of the village school. Locals also claim that one of the tumuli (Урочище Сопки) at the north end of the village is the grave of Oleg, Rurik’s successor.
Archaeological expeditions continue to uncover a wealth of information about the town’s past. In 1997 a second 9th-century fortress was discovered 2km outside the village. Evidence of Byzantine influences in the frescoes of the village’s 12th-century churches point to the town as a cultural as well as historical and commercial crossroads.

1Sights
Everything of interest lies along the main road that runs parallel to the river.

Staraya Ladoga Fortress
HISTORIC SITE
(Староладожская крепость GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R150/free; h9am-5pm Mon-Fri, to 6pm Sat & Sun)
Towards the southern end of the village, and with an excellent view along the river, the 7m-thick walls and stout towers of this fortress are slowly being rebuilt. Inside the grounds you’ll find the small stone St George’s Church (Георгиевская Церковь GOOGLE MAP ; 9am-6pm; hMay-Oct), only open May to October in order to protect the remains of the delicate 12th-century frescoes still visible on its walls, and the cute wooden Church of Dimitry Solun.
The Vorotnaya Tower houses the good Historical-Architectural & Archaeological Museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; h9am-5pm Mon-Fri, to 6pm Sat & Sun), which displays an interesting retrospective of the area’s history, including a scale model of how the fortress once looked and items found on archaeological digs, with English explanations.
Visiting this soulful old place and wandering around its crumbling ramparts is a unique experience and you might feel you're in a Tarkovsky film.

Nikolsky Monastery
MONASTERY
(Никольский монастырь GOOGLE MAP ; www.en.nikmonas.ru; h9am-6pm)
This attractive walled complex dates to the 12th century and is still in the process of being rebuilt following its decommissioning during the Soviet years. The main church and bell tower now look quite handsome. Nearby is a pontoon from which you can swim in the river.

8Getting There & Away
Elektrichki to Volkhov (the Volkhovstroy I station) depart from both St Petersburg’s Moskovsky and Ladozhsky stations (R300, 2½ hours, 20 daily). From Volkhov, bus 23 (R48, 30 minutes, hourly) departs from the main bus stop outside the station towards Novaya Ladoga, passing through Staraya Ladoga. Get off when you see the fortress. A taxi from Volkhov costs R320.
Buses to and from Tikhvin also pass near the Yuzhkovo turn-off to the village, so you can combine a visit to both destinations. When you get off at Yuzhkovo, take a taxi (there are usually a couple hanging around to meet buses) to Staraya Ladoga (R250). It's also just as easy to take a train from Tikhvin to Volkhov.



Tikhvin Тихвин
%81367 / POP 57,900 / TIME MOSCOW
The highlight of this small, quiet town on the banks of the Tikhvinka River is a beautiful monastery established in 1560 by decree of Ivan the Terrible. There’s been a community here since the 14th century, and for thousands of years before that the area formed part of the hereditary lands of the Finnic Veps (also known as Vepsians). Tikhvin is also the birthplace of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, whose music was inspired by the local nature, folk tunes and religious ringing of bells.

Rising like a fairy tale across the Tabory pond, this complex is about a 1km walk from the train station straight along Sovetskaya ul. At its heart is the onion-domed Assumption Cathedral, established in 1510, and painted inside, and partially outside, with detailed frescoes. A famous icon of Mary and Jesus said to have been painted by the apostle Luke draws awed pilgrims from across Russia, particularly on 9 July, when a procession celebrates the return of the icon to Tikhvin.
The complex’s nunnery, crowned by a five-spired belfry, is where Ivan the Terrible sent his fourth wife to be confined. Within the walls you’ll also find several museums, including the Tikhvin Historical Memorial & Architectural Museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; ul Tikhvinskaya 1; adult/child R120/free; h9am-5pm Tue-Sun), which has interesting displays on the monastery’s history and examples of its religious art dating back to the 16th century.

Bus 860 goes four times a day from St Petersburg's bus station to Tikhvin (R400, 4½ hours). The last departure from Tikhvin back to St Petersburg is around 5pm.
To travel to Staraya Ladoga, there is no direct service. By train you can travel from Tikhvin to Volkhov (1½ to two hours, from R550, eight daily), and hop on an onward bus (R48, 30 minutes) or taxi (R330) into town.

White Nights
1In mid-June the sun slumps lazily towards the horizon, but never fully sets, meaning that the magical nights are a wonderful whitish-grey. At this time Petersburgers indulge themselves in plenty of all-night revelry, several arts festivals take place including the spectacular Scarlet Sails (Алые паруса GOOGLE MAP ; http://parusaspb.ru; hJun). Though it’s the busiest time to visit the city, and most hotels are booked up weeks in advance, there’s nothing quite like it, so don’t miss out – even if you come in May or July you’ll be impressed by how late the sun stays out!

6Arguably the most beautiful of the tsarist palace areas that surround St Petersburg, Tsarskoe Selo can be an idyllic place for a day trip. Arrive in good time to see the lavish interiors of the Catherine Palace, including the famous Amber Room, enjoy the gorgeous formal gardens and have a picnic in the landscaped park where Catherine the Great so loved to walk. When it gets impossibly busy at the height of summer, retreat to the nearby scenic estate and palace of Pavlovsk, a beautiful place to escape the crowds.

Mariinsky Ballet
7What could be more Russian than seeing a ballet or opera at the city’s famous Mariinsky Theatre? Formerly known as the Kirov, where Soviet stars such as Nureyev and Baryshnikov danced, the Mariinsky has one of the world's premier ballet troupes as well as a superb orchestra led by artistic director Valery Gergiev. Tickets for productions here are always sought-after, so book online before you travel to ensure you don’t miss out. Even if such performances are not your thing, the historic building is a sight in its own right.

Cruising the Canals
9St Petersburg is a city that is best appreciated from the water. Despite Peter’s efforts, public boat transport by river and canal never quite caught on in the ‘Venice of the North’. Even so, don't miss a canal-boat tour or, better yet, paddling yourself in a kayak to see some of the city's architectural gems from a different perspective. While cruising the canals is only possible outside the winter months, if you're here when they're frozen over don't miss wandering along their banks for a visual treat.

Arriving in St Petersburg
Pulkovo Airport From St Petersburg's superb airport, an official taxi to the centre should cost between R800 and R1000; if you book one via an app it's likely to be R700. Alternatively, take bus 39 (35 minutes) or 39A (20 minutes) to Moskovskaya metro station for R35, then take the metro from Moskovskaya (Line 2) all over the city for R45.
Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal) Easy connection to the nearby pl Vosstaniya (Line 1) and Mayakovskaya (Line 3) metro stations.



Travel at Night
Public transport in St Petersburg shuts down some time after midnight, meaning that taxis and walking are your only options for getting around. There's also the issue of some bridges over the Neva River rising nightly between April and November. This means that if you want to cross the river late at night you need to plan accordingly. Now that there is the Western High Speed Diameter highway it's always possible to get from one side of the Neva to the other, although it will involve a possibly long taxi ride across this toll road.




Top Itineraries

Day One
Historic Heart

MBegin your first day by taking a stroll down Nevsky pr, the city’s central avenue that connects the Hermitage to the Alexander Nevsky Monastery at the far end. Start at Ploshchad Vosstaniya, cross the lovely Fontanka, drop into the Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood and the Kazan Cathedral and end up at the dazzling ensemble of Palace Square, the Winter Palace and the General Staff Building.

Day Two
Historic Heart

MAfter a hearty breakfast, head to the Hermitage and get ready for a day of artistic exhilaration. Choose which parts of the collection you want to see, though leave some room for on-the-spot decision making – the exhibition is so enormous that you’ll inevitably discover something new. As well as the art, don’t miss the staterooms, and allow yourself plenty of rest stops to avoid exhaustion.
5Lunch Savour some excellent Russian cuisine at Yat.

Historic Heart

RYou may still want to spend a few hours in the museum and make the most of your day ticket. But if you leave and still have some energy, wander along before picking up a sightseeing cruise around the canals – the best way to sightsee without having to do any more walking!


Sennaya & Kolomna

NIf you’ve booked ahead, dress up to spend the evening watching a ballet from the classical repertoire of the Mariinsky Theatre. Even if you haven’t booked, it’s usually quite possible to do so last minute in one of the other theatres in town.


Top Itineraries

Day Three
Petrograd & Vyborg Sides

MThis is your chance to explore the beautiful Petrograd Side. Start with a visit to the Peter & Paul Fortress to see where the city began, wander past the mosque and perhaps drop in to see either Peter’s Cabin or the very interesting Museum of Political History. Wander down Kamennoostrovsky pr to take in the Russian Style Moderne architecture.


Vasilyevsky Island

RAfter lunch, walk across to Vasilyevsky Island, and wander the historic ensemble around the Strelka. Visit the Kunstkamera, Peter the Great’s personal cabinet of curiosities, and drop in to the very interesting Menshikov Palace to see the oldest standing palace in the city. If you enjoy contemporary art, continue on to the excellent Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art.


Smolny & Vosstaniya

NHead south to happening Vosstaniya to gallery-, bar- and gig-hop around Ligovsky pr. See some new artwork at Loft Project ETAGI and, if it's summer, enjoy a drink in the sand and some table football at Dyuni.

Day Four
Around St Petersburg

MHead out of the city early to spend the day in tsarist opulence. Go first to Tsarskoe Selo in order to visit the Catherine Palace and have a walk in the gardens. If you’re still wanting more, head for Pavlovsk, a quick bus ride away, where the park is even wilder and more beautiful.
5Lunch Eat at White Rabbit in the town of Pushkin.

Historic Heart

RReturn to the city in the afternoon and slot in the Russian Museum, the perfect complement to the Hermitage. This spectacular (and far more manageable) museum showcases seven centuries of Russian art from church icons to the avant-garde.






Walking Tours

St Petersburg Free Tour (http://petersburgfreetour.com) The central offering of this tour company is its 10.45am daily free city tour, which departs from the Alexander Column on Palace Square. But the company has plenty of other (not free but still reasonably priced) tours on offer, including metro tours, communist Leningrad and the Hermitage.







Travelling to Moscow

Many visitors to St Petersburg combine their trip here with one to Moscow. Russia's two largest cities are superbly well connected to each other, with flights leaving at least every hour, Sapsan express trains during the day, slower overnight trains you can sleep on, and even slower boats.

Air
The following airlines fly direct from Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg to three different Moscow airports. Book in advance and you can get tickets as cheap as R2750 one-way, although normally prices are between R4000 and R7000.
Aeroflot (www.aeroflot.ru) Flies around 20 times a day to Sheremetyevo Airport.
Rossiya Airlines (www.rossiya-airlines.com) Flies to Vnukovo Airport and operates 11 flights per day between the two cities.
S7 Airlines (www.s7.ru) Operates 11 flights per day between St Petersburg and Domodedovo Airport.
UTair (www.utair.ru) Operates four daily flights between St Petersburg and Vnukovo Airport.
Ural Airlines (www.uralairlines.com) Offers two daily flights to Domodedovo Airport.
Boat
Boats from Moscow and elsewhere within Russia arrive at the River Passenger Terminal, which is a short walk away from the Proletarskaya metro station. Leaving the metro, turn right onto pr Obukhovskoy Oborony and it’s five minutes up the road.
Train
All trains to Moscow from St Petersburg depart from the Moscow Station. Take your pick from the overnight sleeper trains or the super-fast Sapsan day trains. All train tickets can be bought online at www.rzd.ru, or from the machines at any station in St Petersburg.
Overnight
There are about 10 overnight trains travelling between St Petersburg and Moscow. Most depart between 10pm and 1am, arriving in the capital the following morning between 6am and 8am. On the more comfortable firmenny trains, such as the Red Arrow (Красная стрела) or Grand Express (ГРАНД ЭКСПРЕСС) a de-luxe sleeping carriage is between R12,800 and R16,400, 1st-class compartment (two-person cabin) around R16,300, while a 2nd-class kupe (four-person cabin) is R2800. Less fancy trains offer 3rd-class platzkartny (dorm-style sleeping carriages) for R1570 and even sitting-only carriages for R890.
If in a sleeping carriage you may have to pay a small amount extra for bed linen, although with some tickets this – and breakfast – is included.
Sapsan
These high-speed trains travel at 200km/h to reach Moscow in around four hours. There are six to eight daily departures. Comfortable 2nd-class seats start at R1300, while super-spacious 1st-class seats run from R5000.






Museums & Galleries

St Petersburg is a city of museums and galleries, famed around the world for its world-class collection at the Hermitage, but also for the stellar Russian Museum and the widely renowned Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. Elsewhere, St Petersburg's smaller institutions focus on everything from the Arctic to zoology, via bread, toys, trams, trains, religion and vodka.

The Big Three
If you're only going to visit three museums, make it a triad of art galleries: the Hermitage, the Russian Museum and the Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. The Hermitage needs no introduction – suffice to say that one of the greatest art collections on the planet should always be top of your must-see list. The lesser-known Russian Museum displays Russian art from the medieval times until the early 20th century and is the perfect counterpoint to the Hermitage's Western Art collection. Finally, though it only opened in 2010, Erarta has established itself as one of world's best collections of modern and contemporary Russian art and should not be missed.
Newer Additions
While many of St Petersburg's most august museums are bastions of tradition, things are being kept fresh and exciting by several newer arrivals. Top of the list are the fabulous galleries at the General Staff Building, a major branch of the Hermitage that's home to a superb collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works by the likes of Monet, Matisse and Picasso. The dazzling Fabergé Museum, in a converted palace on the Fontanka, showcases the apex of Peter Carl Fabergé's jewellery making and features some 1500 of his unique creations including nine Imperial Easter eggs. A rather different tone is set by the exciting Street Art Museum, based on the territory of a laminated plastics factory in the suburb of Okhta. Here the brick and concrete walls act as canvases for celebrated and up-and-coming street artists from across Russia and around the world to create a different themed show each year. An old collection of boats, models and paintings has been rejuvenated by a new location for the Central Naval Museum in Kolomna. Nearby you'll find MISP, the Museum of St Petersburg Art (20th–21st centuries), with regularly changing exhibitions of modern and contemporary works by local artists.
The Best of the Rest
Other smaller and often lesser-known museums that are well worth building into your itinerary include the Russian Museum of Ethnography displaying traditional crafts and cultures from across the region; and the excellent complex of museums at the Peter & Paul Fortress, the kernel of 18th-century St Petersburg and home to a good museum covering the city's history.
Art Galleries & House Museums
Some of Russia's most famous artists, including Ilya Repin and Karl Bryullov, trained at the renowned Academy of Arts and the Applied Arts School. Both these schools have galleries open to the public that are well worth checking out. An appreciation of the arts continues to be fostered in the city.
St Petersburg is also a city of literary titans. The flat where Pushkin breathed his last after his fatal duel is preserved as a museum. So too are the former homes of the writers Gabriel Derzhavin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Vladimir Nabokov and Anna Akhmatova. Each provides some insight into the lives of these famed literary figures as well as a chance to glimpse how Russians lived in the past.
NEED TO KNOW

Opening Days & Hours

Nearly all museums close at least one day a week. This tends to vary, although Monday and Tuesday are the most common days. Be aware that in addition to this, many museums close one day a month additionally for cleaning; it’s worth checking a museum’s website for these details.
Language Issues

Things are getting better but few museums have full signage in English. Audioguides, increasingly available in English, are a great way to understand a collection. Guided tours in English vary enormously in quality and usually need to be booked in advance.
Ticket Prices

As a foreigner you will often be charged a ‘foreigner price’, anything from 50% to 100% more than the Russian price. That said, children, students and pensioners all normally receive discounts on entrance fees, even as foreigners, so it’s always worth asking.

Eating


Getting Serious About Food
St Petersburg has become a place where good food is prized and defined not by its high price tag but rather by the talents of the chef. Fresh, local ingredients, inventive combinations, the use of herbs and spices (other than the ubiquitous dill) and a wider range of flavours are a fixture on the city’s dining tables, and while there’s still plenty of mediocre food out there, visitors today are truly spoiled for choice. We’ve never had an easier time recommending restaurants. However, good places are rarely the most obvious and it's recommend to reserve for the very best.

Modern Russian
Russian food, it’s fair to say, has an image problem – and if you’re not careful you can easily end up with dill-smothered soups, under-seasoned and over-cooked meats, and salads that are more mayonnaise than vegetable. But fret not: there is great Russian cooking to be had in St Petersburg now – both traditional and contemporary, and increasingly a combination of the two. Russian chefs have been rediscovering their own culinary history and have been slowly moving away from the dozen or so standard offerings that are ubiquitous on the country’s menus. They’re preparing rarer or even forgotten dishes, such as venison and duck cooked in subtle and interesting ways and combined with herbs and fresh, organic vegetables. 

Local Chains
St Petersburg has a number of home-grown restaurant and cafe chains that are well worth knowing about as they provide cheap and reliable eating options all over town. Chief among these is the now international pie chain Stolle (Штолле; www.stolle.ru), a near-ubiquitous cafe where delicious, moist savoury and sweet pies are available to eat in and take away. Similar and equally numerous is the chain of bakery cafes Bulochnye F. Volcheka (Булочные Ф. Вольчека; www.fvolchek.ru). A couple of other chains to look out for are coffee-and-cake specialists Bushe (Буше; www.bushe.ru).

International Cuisine
Long gone are the days when international cuisine in St Petersburg was limited to the odd Georgian or Italian place. As Russians have travelled more and experienced more foreign cuisines, their tastes have widened and there's a healthy mixture of non-Russian cuisine available in St Petersburg today, running from Thai and Indian to American and even Lithuanian. Gourmet burgers are hugely popular and there's plenty of excellent French, German, Italian and pan-Asian food on the city's menus – especially sushi (which is rarely that great). More common, however, is the international menu, where Russian dishes, pizza, sushi and noodles all compete side-by-side for your attention. In many cases this means that all four are pretty average, but increasingly there are places that know what they’re doing with multiple cuisines.

Vegetarian Options
There is now a very respectable variety of vegetarian cuisine on offer, both at mainstream restaurants and at an increasing number of meat-free places. Look out for vegetarian chains Troitsky Most, as well as individual restaurants such as Samadeva. Fish is widely offered on menus, making an excellent alternative for pescatarians. During the 40 days before Orthodox Easter (veliky post in Russian), many restaurants also offer a Lent menu that is animal-free.

Neighbourhoods at a Glance

1Historic Heart
Radiating out from the golden spire of the Admiralty towards the Fontanka River, the Historic Heart has plenty of obvious attractions, such as the Hermitage, Russian Museum and the Church on the Spilled Blood, not to mention the city's most famous avenue: Nevsky Prospekt. There are also quirky gems like the Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines and a quartet of lovely parks. This is where you will be spending most of your time in St Petersburg, especially as the area is also blessed with excellent hotels, dining and drinking options.

2Sennaya & Kolomna
These two areas adjoin the Historic Heart and are almost as historic themselves. Sennaya is centred on Sennaya Pl (the Haymarket), a traditionally poor area that was immortalised in Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment and has somehow retained its seedy, down-at-heel air despite a big attempt to redevelop it. Kolomna is the largest of seven islands and a quiet, rather out-of-the-way place, although one steeped in history and great beauty. It contains the world-famous Mariinsky Theatre and more canals and rivers than any other part of the city.
3Smolny & Vosstaniya
This agglomeration of four districts (Smolny, Liteyny, Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya) is also part of the city centre. The Smolny peninsula is a well-heeled residential district dominated by the Smolny Cathedral, while next-door Liteyny is centred on Liteyny pr, a commercial street between the Smolny and the Fontanka River. South of Nevsky pr are Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya. Vosstaniya is the focus of St Petersburg’s underground art and drinking scene, while Vladimirskaya, named after the stunning Vladimirsky Cathedral, is a mercantile district full of shopping, markets and a clutch of quirky museums.
4Vasilyevsky Island
The eastern edge of Vasilyevsky Island (or VO as it's usually shortened to) was originally designed to be the administrative heart of the city under Peter the Great. The plan was never carried out but there's still a concentration of historical sights there, including the Strelka and Kunstkamera. The western side of the island is more industrial, but is also home to the fantastic Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. Transport fans will be thrilled by the opportunity to tour a couple of submarines and an icebreaker, and by museums devoted to trams and the metro.
5Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
The Petrograd Side is a fascinating place that includes everything from the Peter and Paul Fortress to an impressive clutch of Style Moderne buildings lining its main drag. It also hosts a beautiful mosque, many interesting museums and huge swaths of parkland on the Kirov Islands, the city’s largest green lung. The Vyborg Side is famous for its role in Soviet history and can be a little bleak. That said, a walk around the fascinating postindustrial landscape here will appeal to travellers who have palace fatigue, and a few interesting sights make the trip worthwhile.

Explore the Historic Heart
The Historic Heart is a fast-paced, crowded area that's the commercial and tourist focus of the city. For an unforgettable first impression, head straight to vast Palace Sq: on one side is the Winter Palace, home to the main collection of the Hermitage; on the other, the sweeping grandeur of the General Staff Building, its east wing housing the Hermitage's amazing stash of Impressionist and post-Impressionist works.
From here, cherry-pick your way through the rest of the neighbourhood over a couple of days or so. You could spend one day, for example, touring the excellent Russian Museum and its branches such as the Marble Palace and Stroganov Palace. If you're speedy (and have the stamina for visual overload) then also squeeze into the same day the dazzling Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood and the splendid view from the cupola of St St Isaac's Cathedral. When you need a breather, take a break from the hubbub in the lush Summer Garden or Mikhailovsky Garden.
Nevsky pr, the city’s main avenue, dominates every itinerary, and you’ll find yourself back on its broad, busy pavements throughout your visit, popping in and out of shops such as Kupetz Eliseevs. Spend some time off the main drag, though, to find fascinating contrasts, such as the Asian-feeling outdoor market stalls of Apraksin Dvor. In the evening, find high-class entertainment in the theatres around Ploshchad Iskusstv and Ploshchad Ostrovskogo or head to the clubs and cocktails bars that are often hidden away in unexpected places.
Local Life
AFree Art Locals flock to the Hermitage on the first Thursday of each month when entrance is free, although the crowds can be huge!
Getting There & Away
AMetro This neighbourhood is served by three metro stations: the interconnecting Nevsky Prospekt (Line 2) and Gostiny Dvor (Line 3), and Admiralteyskaya (Line 5) around the corner from the Hermitage.
ATrolleybus The number 7 bus, which runs the length of Nevsky pr, goes past Palace Sq and then crosses Dvortsovy most to Vasilyevsky Island.
ABus Hop on buses 7, 10, 24, 27, 181 or 191 to save some footwork along Nevsky.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
A great boon for time-challenged visitors, or those wanting to avoid daytime crowds – especially tour and school groups – has been the extension of opening hours until 9pm at least once a week at major city museums and galleries, including the Hermitage (Wednesday and Friday) and the Russian Museum (Thursday).

PALACE SQUARE
SQUARE
(Дворцовая площадь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovaya pl; mAdmiralteyskaya)
This vast expanse is simply one of the most striking squares in the world, still redolent of imperial grandeur almost a century after the end of the Romanov dynasty. For the most amazing first impression, walk from Nevsky pr, up Bolshaya Morskaya ul and under the triumphal arch ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ).
In the centre of the square, the 47.5m Alexander Column (Алексaндровская колонна MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Palace Sq; mAdmiralteyskaya) was designed in 1834 by Montferrand. Named after Alexander I, it commemorates the 1812 victory over Napoleon.
The square’s northern end is capped by the Winter Palace (Zimny Dvorets), a rococo profusion of columns, windows and recesses, topped by rows of larger-than-life statues. A residence of tsars from 1762 to 1917, it’s now the largest part of the State Hermitage Museum.
Curving an incredible 580m around the south side of the square is the Carlo Rossi–designed General Staff Building completed in 1829. The east wing now houses a branch of the Hermitage while the west wing is the headquarters of the Western Military District. The two great blocks are joined by a triumphal arch over Bolshaya Morskaya ul, topped by the Chariot of Glory by sculptors Stepan Pimenov and Vasily Demuth-Malinovsky, another monument to the Napoleonic Wars.

NEVSKY PROSPEKT
STREET
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Nevsky Prospekt is Russia’s most famous street, running 4km from the Admiralty to Alexander Nevsky Monastery, from which it takes its name. The inner 2.5km to Moskovsky vokzal is the city’s shopping centre and focus of its entertainment and street life. Walking Nevsky is an essential St Petersburg experience. If you’re here on a holiday evening (such as 27 May – City Day), the sight of thousands of people pouring like a stream down its middle is one you’ll not forget.
Nevsky Prospekt was laid out in the early years of St Petersburg, as the start of the main road to Novgorod, and soon became dotted with fine buildings, squares and bridges. At the beginning of the 1900s, it was one of Europe’s grandest boulevards, with cobblestone footpaths and a track down the middle for horse-drawn trams. On either side of the tracks were wooden paving blocks to muffle the sound of horse-drawn carriages – an innovation that was a world-first and for which the avenue was dubbed the quietest main street in Europe.
Today, things are quite a bit noisier. The traffic and crowds can become oppressive and, after a while, you’ll find yourself going out of your way to avoid the street.

Excavations beneath the Hermitage Theatre in the late 1970s revealed remains of the principal residence of Peter the Great, including a large fragment of the former state courtyard, as well as several suites of palace apartments. Some rooms have been restored to their appearance during Peter’s era, complete with Dutch tiles and parquet floors, and are used to exhibit some of Peter’s personal items from the Hermitage collection.
The cobbled courtyard has one of Peter’s official carriages and a sledge. In the last room before you leave, don't miss the wax effigy of Peter made by Bartolomeo Rastrelli after the tsar died in the palace in 1725.

They remain so, dotted with statues of Glinka, Lermontov, Gogol and other cultural figures, as well as a fountain that dates to 1879. Opposite St Isaac's there's a very good children's playground within the garden.

Karl Bulla (1853–1929) was one of the city's most famous photographers and is immortalised in a life-sized statue ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Malaya Sadovaya ul; mGostiny Dvor) on Malaya Sadovaya ul. Around the corner, his studio is still in operation at the top of this building where there's also a gallery of evocative black-and-white images of the city, shot by Bulla and his sons in the late 19th and early 20th century, alongside photographic portraits of the likes of the imperial family, Tolstoy and Chaliapin.

In the very same building that housed the tsarist and the Bolshevik secret police offices, this small museum recounts the history of this controversial institution and includes one room that recreates the office of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka (Bolshevik secret police). Each of the remaining three rooms is devoted to the secret police during a different period of history: the tsarist police, the Cheka and the KGB.

It's distinguished by a four-column portico and topped with a discreet cupola. Concerts are also held here, including free ones when the church organ is played.

Continuing with a tradition of non-Orthodox churches being built on Nevsky pr, the Armenian merchant Ovanes Lazarian paid for the city’s first Armenian church to be erected here in 1771.

PLOSHCHAD OSTROVSKOGO
SQUARE
(Площадь Островского MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mGostiny Dvor)
Created by Carlo Rossi in the 1820s and 1830s, this square is named for Alexander Ostrovsky (1823–86), a celebrated 19th-century playwright. An enormous statue of Catherine the Great ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Ostrovskogo) (1873) stands amid the chess, backgammon and mah-jong players who crowd the benches here. At the Empress’ heels are renowned statesmen of the 19th century, including her lovers Orlov, Potemkin and Suvorov.
The most prominent building on the square is Rossi’s neoclassical Alexandrinsky Theatre.
The square’s west side is taken up by the National Library of Russia ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-310 7137; www.nlr.ru; pl Ostrovskogo 1/3; h9am-9pm Mon-Fri, 11am-7pm Sat & Sun; W; mGostiny Dvor).

PLOSHCHAD LOMONOSOVA
SQUARE
(Площадь Ломоносова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mGostiny Dvor)
Named after the great scientist Mikhail Lomonosov, this small square forms the southwestern end of the Carlo Rossi–designed ensemble and is the best spot from which to admire the ideal symmetrical proportions of ul Zodchego Rossi: the buildings on this street are 22m wide, 22m apart and 220m long.
The Vaganova School of Choreography at No 2 is the Mariinsky Ballet’s training school, where Pavlova, Nijinsky, Nureyev and others learned their art.
From the square you can also admire Most Lomonosova, a stone drawbridge (no longer functioning) dating from 1787 with four Doric pavilions that housed the drawbridge mechanism.

PLOSHCHAD ISKUSSTV
SQUARE
(Площадь Искусств MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mNevsky Prospekt)
In the 1820s and 1830s, Carlo Rossi designed Ploshchad Iskusstv (Arts Square), named after the cluster of museums and concert halls that surrounds it, and the lovely Mikhailovskaya ul, which joins the square to Nevsky pr. There is invariably a pigeon perched atop the statue of Pushkin ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Iskusstv), erected in 1957, which stands in the middle of the tree-lined square.

ANICHKOV PALACE
PALACE
(Аничков дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 9555; www.anichkov.ru; Nevsky pr 39a; mGostiny Dvor)
Built between 1741 and 1751, with input from a slew of architects, including Rastrelli and Rossi, the Anichkov Palace is now officially known as the St Petersburg City Palace of Youth Creativity. It's the location for over 1000 hobby classes and after-school clubs for the city's children. There’s a small museum inside, but it is only open sporadically for tours.
The palace was twice a generous gift for services rendered: Empress Elizabeth gave it to her favourite Count Razumovsky and later Catherine the Great presented it to Potemkin. This was also Tsar Nicholas II’s favourite place to stay in St Petersburg – he far preferred the cosy interiors to the vastness of the Winter Palace.

For an idealised view of what parts of St Petersburg looked like back in the early 18th century, this interactive model village is a small revelation.

Approach the magnificent 1Palace Square on Dvortsovaya pl, from Bolshaya Morskaya ul. Turning the corner from Nevsky pr, behold the 2Alexander Column, perfectly framed under the triumphal arch with the 3Winter Palace as its elaborate backdrop. Turn right at the square's northeast corner to find the colossal 4Atlantes holding aloft the portico of the New Hermitage.
At the Moyka River, cross to the eastern bank using either span of the 5Pevchesky Most. Head north along the river to the final residence of Russia’s most celebrated poet and now the 6Pushkin Flat-Museum. Around the corner, Konyushennaya pl is dominated by the 18th-century court stables, currently under restoration. In the middle of the complex you can visit the 7Church of the Saviour Not Made by Human Hand where Pushkin's funeral service was held.
Rest for a while in either the 8Mars Field, the former imperial guard parade grounds back over the Moyka River, or in the shady canal-side 9Mikhailovsky Gardens. Revived, you'll now be ready for the spectacular aChurch on the Spilled Blood. There's a spetacular view of the church from bTeatralny most near the intersection of the Moyka and Griboyedov Canal.
Detour off nab kanala Griboyedova to find a statue of Pushkin in the middle of pretty cpl Iskusstv. The square is ringed by celebrated cultural institutions, including the dRussian Museum and eMikhailovsky Theatre.
At the junction of Nevsky pr and nab kanala Griboyedova admire the Style Moderne beauty fSinger Building. It's a whimsical contrast to the formidable gKazan Cathedral opposite. Behind the mammoth church, hBankovsky most is the city’s most picturesque and photographed bridge.
Head up Dumskaya ul to return to Nevsky pr and navigate your way along the exterior vaulted gallery surrounding the iBolshoy Gostiny Dvor, the 18th-century trading arcade still serving shoppers. A short walk east along Nevsky pr is Ploshchad Ostrovskogo, a small park with an impressive jstatue of Catherine the Great and a view the impressive facade of the kAlexandrinsky Theatre. Opposite, you can finish up at one of the cafes at the grand food hall lKupetz Eliseevs.

'Abandon hope all ye who enter here,' warns the sign on the door – and it's putting no one off cramming into this popular club that occupies a former chapel in the courtyard area south of the square. In warmer months patrons linger outside where there's a greasy burger bar to help soak up the alcoholic excesses.

Loud, lewd and lots of fun, this is the coolest gay place in town. Take your pick from the main bar, where the uninhibited crowd is often quite literally hanging from the rafters, the Priscilla Queen of the Desert karaoke bar, or the other upstairs bars and dancefloors.
Meaning Blue Oyster, the bar is named after the leather bar that featured in the 1980s Police Academy movies, but is as unlike it as vinyl is to velvet.
BERMUDY BAR DISCOBAR

Huge, with several bars and dance floors, as well as a men-only dark room, this is a stalwart of the St Petersburg gay scene. There are events on throughout the week. Music is mainly at the pop and house end of the spectrum and there's usually plenty of topless eye-candy gyrating at weekends.
WARSZAWABAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/warszawabufet; Kazanskaya ul 11; h10am-2am Sun-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; mNevsky Prospekt)
Russian urbanites have always harboured a special admiration for the quaint provincialism of Eastern Europe, hence this smallish bar with old-fashioned wallpaper, vintage furniture and portraits of 20th-century Polish film stars. Polish beer is on tap and cocktails are based on liquors you may have never heard of. Good for deep, vodka-infused philosophical conversations.
DACHABAR
(Дача MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/bardacha; Dumskaya ul 9; h6pm-6am; mGostiny Dvor)
This is the joint that kicked off the whole Dumskaya dive-bar scene in 2004. We'd say it's showing its age, but truth is that it was never about keeping up appearances here – just drinking and dancing the night through in a packed-to-the-gills space.
FIDELCLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/barfidel; Dumskaya ul 9; h6pm-6am; mGostiny Dvor)
This long-running dive bar is a sort of musical and alcoholic tribute to the ruler who 'outlived six presidents of America and six leaders of the Soviet Union and Russia'.



WITNESS TO HISTORY
Palace Square has been the location for some of the most dramatic moments in St Petersburg's history. On Bloody Sunday (9 January 1905), tsarist troops fired on workers who were peaceably gathered in the square, sparking the 1905 revolution. And it was across Dvortsovaya pl that the storming of the Winter Palace took place during the 1917 October Revolution, an event re-enacted by Lenin and thousands of Red Guards in 1920 and later filmed in 1927 for Sergei Eisenstein's October, commissioned by the government to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.

This magnificent venue is just one part of an immaculate architectural ensemble designed by Carlo Rossi. The theatre’s interior oozes 19th-century elegance and style, and it’s worth taking a peek even if you don’t see a production here.
This is where Anton Chekhov premiered The Seagull in 1896; the play was so badly received on opening that the playwright fled to wander anonymously among the crowds on Nevsky pr. Chekhov is now a beloved part of the theatre's huge repertoire, ranging from Russian folktales to Shakespearean tragedies.
Head through the archway in the southwest corner of the square to find the Alexanderinsky's New Stage.

The New Stage at Alexandrinsky, which opened in 2013, is a strikingly modern building for the historic city center but one that keeps a low profile due to the architect's ingenious use of glass and a secluded courtyard space.

Designed by Giacomo Quarenghi, this intimate neoclassical auditorium was once the private theatre of the imperial family, and stands on the site of the original Winter Palace of Peter I. Book early if you’d like to see a ballet (usually classics such as Swan Lake and Giselle) at a discount, but still be prepared to pay well over the odds compared to other theatres in the city.
Access to the theatre is via an entrance to the Large (Old) Hermitage on Dvortsovaya nab; look for the door on the southwest side of the stone bridge over the small water channel.

One of the handful of cinemas in the city where you can see foreign films and some higher-brow Hollywood productions with subtitles, as well as arty Russian movies. It is also where the British Council holds its British Film Festival. Despite a refit, the whole place remains remarkably Soviet in a charming way.
The cinemas are small so book ahead or get here early if there's a film you particularly want to see. In the same building is Rodina, another classy cinema with two screens.
AVRORACINEMA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-315-52-54; www.avrora.spb.ru; Nevsky pr 60; tickets R300-700; mGostiny Dvor)
Opening in 1913 as the Piccadilly Picture House, this was the city’s most fashionable cinema in the early years of Russian film, and it has retained its position pretty consistently ever since. Today most premieres (to which you can nearly always buy tickets) take place here. Foreign films are dubbed into Russian, though sometimes you’ll find the odd subtitled one.
Renamed the more Soviet-sounding Avrora in 1932, it was here that a young Dmitry Shostakovich played piano accompaniment to silent movies.

This delightful theatre’s name means ‘the actor’s shelter’ and it does a pretty good job of fulfilling its role, providing refuge for some of the city’s best up-and-coming actors, directors and producers. It was founded by actor Yury Tomashevsky in the late 1980s, when the city turned over a defunct cinema that the group still uses.
Productions are in Russian.

MONUMENT TO ALEXANDER III
‘I don’t care about politics. I simply depicted one animal on another,’ said sculptor Paolo Trubetskoy defending his equestrian statue of Alexander III when it was unveiled in 1909. Originally erected on pl Vosstaniya, the unflattering giant bronze of the stout, unpopular tsar had caused a scandal among St Petersburg society who were divided on its artistic merits. Alexander's son Nicholas II considered shipping it off to Irkutsk, but when rumours started that he wanted to send his dad into Siberian exile, he changed his mind.
In 1937 the statue was removed from pl Vosstaniya and sent to languish in an interior courtyard of the Russian Museum. In post-communist Russia, when the Marble Palace ceased to house the Lenin Museum, the statue was moved to the forecourt there, replacing Lenin's armoured car (which now can be seen at the Artillery Museum).

Dating from 1906–7, the one-time Esders and Scheefhaals department store has been beautifully restored and is one of the most glamorous places to shop in the city. This glorious Style Moderne building is now dubbed Au Pont Rouge after the Krasny most (Red Bridge) it stands beside. Inside you'll find choice fashions and accessories and top-notch souvenirs.
The restoration included the rebuilding of the glass cupola, destroyed in the 1930s so as not to clutter the view towards the Admiralty down Gorokhovaya ul. On the ground floor there's a branch of the French cafe Patisserie Garçon.
TYKVAFASHION & ACCESSORIES

Not in the same sprawling, raggedy league as other St Petersburg creative clusters, Maker is really one big shop selling mainly locally designed clothes and accessories, aimed at 'normal people' by which it means its prices are not out of this stratosphere. There's a cafe and a beauty salon here, too.
21 SHOPFASHION & ACCESSORIES

MILITARY SHOPCLOTHING
(Товары для военных MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-309 3924; http://voentorg-spb.ru; Sadovaya ul 26; h10am-8pm; mGostiny Dvor)
In a city with men in uniform on every street corner, this is where you can get yours (the uniform that is!). Buy stripey sailor tops, embroidered badges, big boots, camouflage jackets and snappy caps at decent prices. Look for the circular green and gold sign with ‘Military Shop’ written in English; the entrance is in the courtyard.
YAKHONTJEWELLERY
(Яхонт MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 6415; www.juvelirtorg.spb.ru; Bolshaya Morskaya ul 24; h10am-8pm; mAdmiralteyskaya)
From this building, Carl Fabergé dazzled the imperial family and the rest of the world with his extraordinary bespoke designs. Yakhont has no link to the Fabergé family, but it is carrying on the tradition anyway. This long, dark salon provides an impressive showcase of the work.

This long-established antique bookseller is a fascinating place to rummage around. The stock ranges from fancy, mint-edition books to second-hand, well-worn Soviet editions, maps and art (in the section next to the art-supplies shop). It's a great place to look for an unusual, unique souvenir. Find it in the courtyard off the main road.
APRAKSIN DVORMARKET
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-310 5608; http://apraksinmarket.ru/; Sadovaya ul 30; h10am-7pm; mGostiny Dvor)
There's been a market here since the 18th century. Although parts of it are being upgraded, it remains mostly a gritty and chaotic Dostoevsky-style warren of stalls offering mainly cheap clothes, shoes and leather goods, as well as food and snacks beloved by the multiethnic traders who work here.
If you're hungry look for Chufalnya ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Korpus 27, Apraksin Dvor, Sadovaya ul 30 (enter from Apraksin per); mains R240-360; h10am-10pm; mSennaya Ploshchad), a Chinese grocery and cafe on the upper floor of the Korpus 27 block.

RAISING OF THE BRIDGES

It's quite a sight to witness the raising of the bridges over the Neva river during the navigation period. Dvortsovy most (Palace Bridge; Дворцовый мост MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mAdmiralteyskaya), beside the Winter Palace, is one of the most popular spots to watch this event from as there is classical music broadcast and a carnival atmosphere with street vendors and plenty of sightseeing boats bobbing in the Neva. One company offering these late-night cruises with or without live jazz and blues music is Astra Marine ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-426 1717; www.boattrip.ru; tours R400-800).

Neighbourhood Top Five
1Mariinsky Theatre Seeing a dazzling Russian ballet or opera classic in one of Russia's most celebrated performing arts halls.


Explore Sennaya & Kolomna
Stretching north and south of the meandering Moyka River, these two neighbourhoods may lack the dense concentration of sights found in the Historic Heart, but are still blessed with some spectacular sights. By day, you can explore the lavish interiors of the Yusupov Palace or bask in the greenery and art-filled spaces of New Holland Island, then return by night for magnificent concerts at one of three performing arts venues under the Mariinsky umbrella.
There’s also much history hidden in these scenic streets. Russophiles can wander the lanes off Sennaya Ploschad, a region where Dostoevesky – and some of his best known characters – lived and roamed, and explore pivotal domestic achievements at the Central Naval Museum and the Railway Museum. There are plenty of lesser known attractions as well, including one of the city’s most photogenic cathedrals and Russia’s most impressive synagogue.
You could spend a few days exploring the area, or simply base yourself here. The district offers proximity to the Historic Heart – with more of a local feel – and plenty of great dining options as well.
Local Life
ACanal Life Sennaya and Kolomna are home to some of the prettiest canals in the city, well away from the crowds. Check out the gorgeous Kryukov Canal, the far ends of the Griboyedov Canal and the Fontanka River.
ATransport Issues Get to know the bus and marshrutka routes if you’re going to be spending any time in Kolomna, where there’s no metro and distances on foot can be very long.
Getting There & Away
AMetro Sennaya is served by the interconnecting Sennaya pl (Line 2), Spasskaya (Line 4) and Sadovaya (Line 5) stations, the city’s biggest interchange, entrances to which are all on Sennaya pl. Kolomna is not served by the metro at all at the time of writing, though an extension to the Mariinsky is planned. Currently the nearest stations are those on Sennaya pl or Admiralteyskaya station in the Historic Heart.
ABus Bus 3 connects the Mariinsky with Nevsky pr via Bolshaya Morskaya ul, while Trolleybus 5 connects pl Truda with Nevsky pr via Konnogvardeysky bul.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
Book ahead of time to see the ballet or opera performance you’re interested in at the Mariinsky Theatre, especially during the White Nights, when performances of popular productions sell out months in advance. You can book and pay for tickets on the website, and then collect them at the box office before the performance, which is much better than trying to find what’s available once you’re in town.

MARIINSKY THEATRE
The Mariinsky Theatre has played a pivotal role in Russian ballet ever since it was built in 1859, and it remains one of Russia's most loved and respected cultural institutions. Its pretty green-and-white main building on aptly named Teatralnaya pl (Theatre Sq) is a must for any visitor wanting to see one of the world's great ballet and opera stages.


brian kinney / shutterstock ©
A Glittering History
The building you see today opened its doors in 1860, and was named in honour of Maria Alexandrovna, the wife of Tsar Alexander II. Since its inception, the Mariinsky has seen some of the world's greatest musicians, dancers and singers on its stage. Petipa choreographed his most famous works here, including Swan Lake and The Nutcracker, and the premieres of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades and Prokofiev's Romeo & Juliet were also held here. The Soviets initially closed the Mariinsky down, but as the renamed Kirov Ballet it became a major force in promoting the Soviet Union abroad, and is still the main reason that ballet and Russia remain synonymous worldwide.
Performance
The best way to experience the building as its designers intended is to see an opera or ballet. Outside performance times you can wander into the theatre’s foyer and maybe peep into the lovely auditorium. As well as the main Mariinsky Theatre, there is also the newer, world-class Mariinsky II next door, a 2000-seat, six-stage theatre that marks the Mariinsky’s arrival in the 21st century.

You can guide yourself through the exhibit, or be accompanied by an English-speaking guide who’ll liven things up a bit. If you’d like to sample the exhibits, too, take a tasting tour!

Back in the day, this was called the Museum of Atheism; it had a very strong anti-religious bent and was housed in the Kazan Cathedral. Now the name has changed, as has the location, but the fascinating exhibition remains, describing the history of various world religions, including Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity, and taking in everything from Russian icons to Pacific cults and Greek gods.

This museum occupies the flat where poet Alexander Blok spent the last eight years of his life (1912–20). The 4th-floor apartment has been preserved much as it was when Blok lived here with his wife Lyubov (daughter of chemist and inventor Mendeleev). When the poet fell ill in 1920, his family moved into the 2nd-floor apartment where he died a year later. An exhibition demonstrates the influence of Blok’s work, as well as some original copies of his poems; signage in Russian only.
The revolutionary Blok believed that individualism had caused a decline in society’s ethics, a situation that would only be rectified by the communist revolution he lived to see, though he died before he could become truly disillusioned with post-revolutionary Russia. The room where Blok died contains his death mask and a drawing of Blok on his deathbed, sketched on the last page of the poet’s pad. Chamber concerts and poetry readings occasionally take place here; ask downstairs for the schedule.

Housed in the fabulous 18th-century palace of Chancellor Bezborodko, this museum of communications is the perfect addition to Pochtamtskaya ul (Post Office St). It is named for Professor Alexander Popov, inventor of the radio, and it covers all manner of communication, from the Pony Express to the modern era.
Exhibits are interactive and interesting, including an antique telephone switchboard that still works, the first civil communications satellite, Luch-15, which occupies a prominent place in the atrium, and plenty of multimedia explanations of how things work. Stamp collectors will have a field day admiring the national philatelic collection.

DOSTOEVSKY'S DOMAIN
Dostoevsky lived all over this area; he resided in three flats on tiny Kaznacheyskaya ul alone. From 1861 to 1863, he lived at No 1. In 1864, he spent one month living in the faded red building at No 9, before moving to No 7. Here, he lived from 1864 to 1867 and wrote Crime and Punishment; indeed, the route taken by the novel’s antihero Raskolnikov to murder the old moneylender passed directly under his window.
Speaking of Crime and Punishment, one of the most infamous addresses in the neighbourhood is an innocuous house on the corner of Stolyarny per (called ‘S… lane’ in the book). Known as the Raskolnikov House, it's one of two possible locations of the attic apartment of Dostoevsky's troubled protagonist. Those who claim this is the place go further, saying that Rodion retrieved the murder weapon from a street-sweeper’s storage bin inside the tunnel leading to the courtyard.
The house, not open to the public, is marked by a sculpture of Dostoevsky. The inscription says something to the effect of ‘The tragic fate of the people of this area of St Petersburg formed the foundation of Dostoevsky’s passionate sermon of goodness for all mankind’. Other Dostoevsky connoisseurs argue that it would be more appropriate if Raskolnikov’s attic apartment was located further down the street at No 9, which is otherwise unmarked.

Choose from a wide range of homemade pastas and top them with your favourite sauce, whether tomato-based bolognese or a rich, creamy salmon sauce. A few options for soup, salad and pizza round out the menu, but the pasta is the main focus.

You'll find filling and satisfying curries, tandoors and a delicious selection of vegetarian options – all go nicely with piping hot naan (flatbread).

Behind the curtain is a more formal restaurant with a European menu (duck confit, risotto with wild mushrooms) and a sizeable wine list.

Beef lovers can indulge their habit at this 12,000-sq-metre restaurant, the city’s biggest. Thanks to clever design, though, it doesn’t feel overwhelmingly large or impersonal, with the huge space divided into six stylish yet informal dining spaces. The steaks menu is impressive and there's a large list of side orders, salads and other main courses to choose from as well.

St Petersburg's only kosher restaurant, Le'chaim whips up carefully prepared Jewish and European dishes. Start off with forshmak (an appetizer made with herring) or potato kugel, followed by baked trout, or chicken and matzo ball soup. It's located directly behind the Grand Choral Synagogue in the same gated complex.

The authentic (read: no frills) Korean restaurant is a great find in this quiet residential neighbourhood. There's a wide-ranging, pictorial menu that includes delicious bulgogi (Korean beef barbecue), bossam (spicy pork belly) and bajon (seafood pancakes), as well as perennial favourite bibimbap. Service is fast and friendly, and there's a private banquet room, which draws in the foreign groups.

oMARIINSKY THEATREBALLET, OPERA
(Мариинский театр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-326 4141; www.mariinsky.ru; Teatralnaya pl 1; tickets R1200-6500; mSadovaya)
St Petersburg's most spectacular venue for ballet and opera, the Mariinsky Theatre is an attraction in its own right. Tickets can be bought online or in person; book in advance during the summer months. The magnificent interior is the epitome of imperial grandeur, and any evening here will be an impressive experience.
Known as the Kirov Ballet during the Soviet era, the Mariinsky has an illustrious history, with troupe members including such ballet greats as Nijinsky, Nureyev, Pavlova and Baryshnikov. In recent years the company has been invigorated by the current artistic and general director, Valery Gergiev, who has worked hard to make the company solvent while overseeing the construction of the impressive and much-needed second theatre, the Mariinsky II, across the Kryukov Canal from the company's green-and-white wedding cake of a building. It is pretty certain that the Mariinsky Theatre will close at some point in 2018 or 2019 for a full (and, again, much needed) renovation, so visit the building's faded grandeur while you can.
MARIINSKY IIBALLET, OPERA
(Мариинский II MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-326 4141; www.mariinsky.ru; ul Dekabristov 34; tickets R350-6000; hticket office 11am-7pm; mSadovaya)
Finally opening its doors in 2013 after more than a decade of construction, legal wrangles, scandal and rumour, the Mariinsky II is a showpiece for St Petersburg's most famous ballet and opera company. It is one of the most technically advanced music venues in the world, with superb sightlines and acoustics from all of its 2000 seats.
There's no denying that the modern-yet-not-modern-enough-to-be-interesting exterior is no great addition to St Petersburg's magnificent wealth of buildings. Inside, though, it's a different story. The interior is a beautifully crafted mixture of backlit onyx, multi-level public areas between which staircases, lifts and escalators weave, limestone walls, marble floors and Swarovski chandeliers. The simple yet superbly designed auditorium boasts plenty of legroom, three stages that can be combined to form one, and an orchestra pit that can hold no fewer than 120 musicians. Serious music fans should come here to see a state-of-the-art opera and ballet venue, while anyone curious to see the results of a decade of building work will also not leave disappointed.
As well as the main auditorium, there are also several smaller venues within the venue (Prokofiev Hall, Stravinsky Foyer, Shchedrin Hall, Mussorgsky Hall), all of which host regular concerts that can be a cheaper alternative to seeing a performance in the main hall.
MARIINSKY CONCERT HALLCLASSICAL MUSIC
(Мариинский концертный зал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mariinsky.ru; ul Dekabristov 37; tickets R700-1800; hticket office 11am-8pm; mSadovaya)
Opened in 2007, this concert hall is a magnificent multifaceted creation. It manages to preserve the historic brick facade of the set and scenery warehouse that previously stood on this spot, while the modern main entrance, facing ul Dekabristov, is all tinted glass and angular lines, hardly hinting at the beautiful old building behind.
Its array of classical orchestral performances is superb, but be aware that it’s a modern venue, and won’t provide your typical ‘night at the Mariinsky’ atmosphere.
YUSUPOV PALACE THEATRETHEATRE
(Театр Юсуповского дворца MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 9883; www.yusupov-palace.ru; nab reki Moyki 94; tickets R700-3200; mSadovaya)
Housed inside the outrageously ornate Yusupov Palace, this elaborate yet intimate venue was the home entertainment centre for one of the city’s foremost aristocratic families. While you can visit the theatre when you tour the palace, seeing a performance here is a treat, as you can imagine yourself the personal guest of the notorious Prince Felix himself.
The shows are a mixed bag – usually a ‘Gala Evening’ that features fragments of various Russian classics.
ST PETERSBURG OPERAOPERA
(Санкт-Петербургская Опера MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 3982; www.spbopera.ru; ul Galernaya 33; tickets R700-2000; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Housed in the sumptuous (and dare we say, rather bizarre) former home of Baron von Derviz, the St Petersburg Opera performs regular operas in its intimate and grandly lavish former ballroom. With just 187 seats, you're guaranteed a good view of the Russian, Italian and German classics, even if the quality can't compare to other more established opera houses in the city.

Terrible title, but not a bad show of traditional Russian folk dancing and music. The pricey two-hour performance features four different folk groups, complete with accordion, balalaika and Cossack dancers. As a bonus, it's held inside the spectacular Nikolayevsky Palace.
LENDOKCINEMA
(Лендок MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-714 0806; www.lendoc.ru; nab Kryukova kanala 12; tickets R150-350; h11am-11pm; mSenaya)
Occupying a grand former mansion, this cinema and working film studio specialises mainly in documentary films, including international ones, although they do also screen feature films.
The lobby bar is also a pleasant spot for a drink or something to eat – when they have a week specialising in a nation's cinema here, the menu features dishes from that country.

Designer Natalia Larchenko has taken the classic Russian nesting doll silhouette and transformed it into a tiny work of art in her attractive necklaces, bracelets, earrings – including works in amber from the Kaliningrad region. The curvy design also features in both bold and subtle patterns on silk scarves and shawls, as well as soft pullovers.
Quality materials (rose gold, sterling silver) and fine craftsmanship (most products are made in Italy) are essential to the brand.

GALLERY OF DOLLSGIFTS & SOUVENIRS

Featuring ballerinas and babushkas, clowns and knights, this gallery depicts just about every fairy-tale character and political persona in doll form. The highly creative figures are more like art than toys and make unusual souvenirs (although they’re admittedly an acquired taste).
KOSHER SHOPFOOD & DRINKS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.en.jeps.ru; Lermontovsky pr 2; h10am-9pm Sun-Fri; mSadovaya)
Serving St Petersburg’s Jewish community, the Kosher Shop is conveniently located next to the Grand Choral Synagogue. Although its emphasis is on hard-to-find kosher food, the shop also sells some souvenirs (Jewish-themed matryoshki), Jewish music and art.
SENNOY MARKETFOOD & DRINKS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Moskovsky pr 4; h8am-7pm; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Cheaper and less atmospheric than Kuznechny Market, Sennoy Market is also centrally located. You’ll find fruit and vegies, as well as freshly caught fish and fresh meat, which makes it a useful spot for self-caterers.

Smolny & Vosstaniya


Explore Smolny & Vosstaniya
This area, bisected by the second half of Nevsky pr, breaks down into four districts: Smolny, Liteyny, Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya. An extremely varied place, it contains the closest thing St Petersburg has to a creative hub, as well as its political and diplomatic heart. You could easily spend a few days taking in the major sights of this vast district and still only scratch the surface.
Among the big draws here are the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, worth a half-day visit in the southeast corner, and the collection of museums and historic sites in Liteyny near the Fontanka River, which could warrant a full day (or more) of exploration. Aside from delving into history and culture, there's much to discover just on neighbourhood wanders – from browsing record stores and indie booksellers on streets a few blocks north and south of Nevsky to cafe-hopping on restaurant-lined ul Rubinshteyna. By night, the district has just as much to offer, with some of the best bars in the city, particularly around the Liteyny area.
Slowly gentrifying Vosstaniya still feels a bit run-down, but is the closest Petersburg has to a creative and alternative culture hub, with art galleries, bars and clubs.
Local Life
AShopping Mayhem Smolny and Vosstaniya boast two of the city’s biggest shopping centres – Galeria and Nevsky Centre.
APark Life When the weather is fine, join locals in the Tauride Garden, one of St Petersburg's most laid-back green spaces.
ANightlife Save at least one night for a bar crawl in the Liteyny area. Here, you'll find some of St Petersburg's best concentration of nightlife, from live music joints and swanky lounges to craft beer halls and buzzing cocktail bars.

Lonely Planet's Top Tip
Walking the busy streets of St Petersburg can sometimes be pure sensory overload. For a more peaceful vantage point, head up to one of the rooftop restaurants and bars overlooking the city. Gastronomika serves up excellent cuisine to memorable views.

MUSEUM OF THE ARCTIC & ANTARCTIC
MUSEUM
(Музей Арктики и Антарктики MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.polarmuseum.sp.ru; ul Marata 24A; adult/child R300/80; h10am-6pm Wed-Sun; mVladimirskaya)
This museum is devoted to polar expeditions, wildlife, cultures and history. The enormous collection includes scientific equipment, maps, taxidermy, photographs, clothing and artefacts from polar cultures. Apart from the stuffed polar bears and emperor penguins, the most impressive exhibit is a 1930s wooden seaplane hanging from the ceiling, used during the Soviet exploration of the 'Red North' under Stalin. As you'd expect there's a strong focus on Soviet polar exploration, and there's very little signage in English.
Its location in the former Old Believers’ Church of St Nicholas is not well disguised, and the premises are very impressive, especially the upper floor, a round gallery overlooked by a crumbling cupola.

Splendid wrought-iron gates facing the Fontanka River guard the entrance to the Sheremetyev Palace (built 1750–55), now a branch of the State Museum of Theatre & Music, which has a collection of musical instruments from the 19th and 20th centuries. The Sheremetyev family was famous for the concerts and theatre performances they hosted at their palace, which was a centre of musical life in the imperial capital.
Upstairs, you'll find a lovely collection of 18th-century mahogany furniture, Italian renaissance paintings and rare instruments (including a grand piano that belonged to Glinka), spread among handsomely restored rooms. The most impressive, such as the green drawing room, were designed in second empire baroque style. The ground floor is given over to an enormous collection of more instruments (separate admission fee), but is probably only of great interest to collectors.

CATHEDRAL OF THE TRANSFIGURATION OF OUR SAVIOUR
CATHEDRAL
(Спасо-Преображенский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Preobrazhenskaya pl; h8am-8pm; mChernyshevskaya)
The interior of this marvellous 1743 cathedral, which has been beautifully restored and repainted both outside and in, is one of the most gilded in the city. The grand gates bear the imperial double-headed eagle in vast golden busts, reflecting the fact that the cathedral was built on the site where the Preobrazhensky Guards (the monarch’s personal protection unit) had their headquarters.
Architect Vasily Stasov rebuilt the cathedral from 1827 to 1829 in the neoclassical style. It is dedicated to the victory over the Turks in 1828–29; note the captured Turkish cannons, wrapped in chains, in the gate surrounding the cathedral.

SMOLNY INSTITUTE
HISTORIC BUILDING
(Смольный институт MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Proletarskoy Diktatury 3; mChernyshevskaya)
Built by Giacomo Quarenghi between 1806 and 1808 as a school for aristocratic girls, the Smolny Institute was thrust into the limelight in 1917 when it became the headquarters for the Bolshevik Central Committee and the Petrograd Soviet. From here, Trotsky and Lenin directed the October Revolution, and in the Hall of Acts (Aktovy zal) on 25 October, the All-Russian Congress of Soviets conferred power on a Bolshevik government led by Lenin.
The Smolny Institute served as the seat of Soviet power until March 1918, when the capital was relocated to Moscow. In 1934, the powerful Leningrad Party chief Sergei Kirov was assassinated in its corridors, on orders from Stalin, ridding the Soviet leader of a perceived rival and simultaneously providing the perfect pretext for the notorious Leningrad purges. Today St Petersburg’s governor continues to run the city from here. Although it's closed to the public, some of the big tour companies, such as SPB Tours (www.spb-tours.com), include a short visit inside the Smolny Institute on multiday tours around St Petersburg.

It's set in a former mansion that was converted into a massive cinema during the Soviet era. In 2014, the building reopened in its present form and hosts a wide-ranging repertoire of concerts, dance performances, musical theatre and film screenings. You can't miss the video wall in the foyer – said to be the largest in Europe.

BOLSHOY DOM
HISTORIC BUILDING
(Большой дом MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Liteyny pr 4; mChernyshevskaya)
Noi Trotsky’s monolithic design for the local KGB headquarters (and currently the St Petersburg headquarters of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, its successor organisation) is referred to by everyone as the ‘Bolshoy Dom’ or ‘Big House’. It’s a fierce-looking block of granite built in 1932 in the late-constructivist style and was once a byword for fear among the people of the city: most people who were taken here during the purges were never heard from again. Obviously, the building is not open to the public.
Employees who have worked here include Vladimir Putin during his KGB career. The Bolshoy Dom made the news in 2010, when the subversive art collective Voina (War) drew a 65m-long penis on the nearby Liteyny Bridge, which, when the bridge was raised, made a very clear statement towards the FSB.

ANNA AKHMATOVA MONUMENT
MONUMENT
(Памятник Анне Ахматовой MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab Robespierre; mChernyshevskaya)
This moving statue of St Petersburg’s most famous 20th-century poet was unveiled in 2006, across the river from the notorious Kresty holding prison, to mark the 40th anniversary of Akhmatova’s death. The location is no coincidence – Kresty Prison was where Akhmatova herself queued for days in the snow for news of her son after his multiple arrests during Stalin’s terror.
The inscription on the monument comes from her epic poem ‘Requiem’, in which she describes life during the purges. It reads: ‘That’s why I pray not for myself/But for all of you who stood there with me/Through fiercest cold and scorching July heat/Under a towering, completely blind red wall.’

MONUMENT TO THE VICTIMS OF POLITICAL REPRESSION
MONUMENT
(Памятник жертвам политических репрессий MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab Robespierre; mChernyshevskaya)
This gruesome piece of sculpture by Russian artist Mikhail Shemyakin was unveiled in 1995, shortly after the end of the Soviet Union, and during a time of relative lustration. The scultpure is centred on two sphinxes, both of which look, from one side, like beautiful creatures. However, view them from the other side (facing the infamous Kresty Prison across the water) and it's clear the beauty has been corrupted beyond recognition and half the face is a mere skull.
Lines of writing from many of the Soviet system's victims are engraved on the monument's granite base. It's a sad and deeply moving place.

Among the collection you'll find everything from bespoke dinner services used by the tsars to unique constructivist tea sets created in the 1920s, indicative of the factory's versatility in serving its various political masters.
Don't miss the exquisite collection of porcelain statuettes depicting the various peoples of Russia and beyond, with clothing so beautifully rendered it looks like fabric.

This grand old Petersburg residence was the home to court poet Gabriel Derzhavin (1743–1816), one of Russia's greatest early writers, who recognised the genius of Alexander Pushkin during Pushkin's own childhood. Having been divided into some 60 communal apartments under the Soviets, the mansion was fully renovated in 2003 and is now a charming museum. The focus of the house is Derzhavin's own study, with its three secret entrances.

(Троицкий собор GOOGLE MAP ; Izmailovsky pr 7A; h9am-7pm Mon-Sat, 8am-8pm Sun, services 10am daily & 5pm Fri-Sun; mTekhnologichesky Institut)
The Trinity Cathedral boasts stunning blue cupolas emblazoned with golden stars. A devastating fire in 2006 caused the 83m-high central cupola to collapse, but it has been fully restored and now looks even better than it did before. Construction of the vast cathedral began in 1828, according to a design by Vasily Stasov. The cathedral was consecrated in 1835 and functioned as the chapel for the Izmailovsky Guards, who were garrisoned next door.
In honour of the Russian victory in the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, the memorial Column of Glory was constructed out of 128 Turkish cannons. (The present monument was erected on the north side of the cathedral in 2003: it is an exact replica of the original, which was destroyed by Stalin.)
The cathedral was famed for its immense collection of icons, as well as several silver crosses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. After the revolution, most of these treasures were looted, the ornate interiors were destroyed and the cathedral was finally closed in 1938.
Trinity Cathedral was returned to the Orthodox Church in 1990, but the interior is decidedly bare, especially compared with its previous appearance. It was here that Fyodor Dostoevsky married his second wife, Anna Snitkina, in 1867.

‘Happiness’ comes in several forms here: a multiroomed venue full of cosy nooks and crannies to huddle up in, an expansive Italian menu, delicious pastries and tempting sweets, and lavish and thoroughly warm (if somewhat random) decor (think jars full of pasta and photo frames with stock shots of family members).

A GIFT TO YOUNG HOUSEWIVES
The most popular cookbook in 19th-century Russia was called A Gift to Young Housewives, a collection of favourite recipes and household management tips that turned into a bestseller. The author, Elena Molokhovets, a housewife herself, was dedicated to her 10 children, to the Orthodox Church, and to her inexperienced ‘female compatriots’ who might need assistance keeping their homes running smoothly.
This book was reprinted 28 times between 1861 and 1914, and Molokhovets added new recipes and helpful hints to each new edition. The last edition included literally thousands of recipes, as well as pointers on how to organise an efficient kitchen, how to set a proper table and how to clean a cast-iron pot.
Molokhovets received an enormously positive response from readers who credited her with no less than preserving their family life. The popular perception of the time was that a wife’s primary responsibility was to keep her family together, and keeping her husband well fed seemed to be the key. As one reader wrote, ‘A good kitchen is…not an object of luxury. It is a token of the health and well-being of the family, upon which all the remaining conditions of life depend’. Molokhovets included some of these letters in later editions as testimony to her work.
The classic cookbook was never reprinted during the Soviet period. The details of sumptuous dishes and fine table settings – let alone questions of etiquette and style – would certainly have been considered bourgeois by the Soviet regime. Yet still, copies of this ancient tome survived, passed down from mother to daughter like a family heirloom. Today, the book reads not only as a cookbook, but also as a lesson in history and sociology.

NA ZDOROVYE!
‘To your health!’ is what Russians say when they throw back a shot of vodka. But this pronouncement hardly suffices as a proper toast in a public forum or an intimate drinking session among friends. A proper toast requires thoughtfulness and sincerity.
A few themes prevail. The first toast of the night often acknowledges the generosity of the host, while the second usually recognises the beauty of the ladies present. In mixed company, you can’t go wrong raising your glass to international friendship (za mezhdunarodnuyu druzhbu) or world peace (za miravoy mir). But in all cases, the toast requires a personal anecdote or a profound insight, as well as a bit of rambling preamble to make it meaningful.
In Russia, drinking vodka is a celebration of life in all its complexity – the triumph, the tragedy and the triviality. A toast is a vocalisation of that celebration, so say it like you mean it. And drink it in the same way – zalpom – bottoms up!

Vasilyevsky Island

Neighbourhood Top Five
5Icebreaker Krasin Hearing tales of Soviet exploration in the Arctic aboard this retired icebreaker.

Explore Vasilyevsky Island
This large, triangular island is among the oldest neighbourhoods in St Petersburg, especially the eastern tip known as the Strelka (‘tongue of land’). Crammed with classical buildings housing institutions, excellent museums such as Menshikov Palace, and the sprawling campus of St Petersburg State University, this is the best place to start your exploration of the island.
Further back from the Strelka, Vasilyevsky Ostrov (or VO as it's commonly shortened to) is an orderly, residential place, with a grid system of wide roads lined with shops, restaurants and cafes. Make a beeline for the Russian Academy of Arts Museum, the historic St Andrew's Cathedral, the stunningly decorated Temple of the Assumption, and the compact Novy Museum showcasing late-20th-century art from the Soviet Union.
The northern and western ends of the island are rather post industrial and remote. Even so, there are things worth coming out this way to see, including the fantastic Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art, and the chance to tour around the Icebreaker Krasin and two submarines. Transport wonks will also be thrilled to find museums devoted to the city's metro and tram systems.
Local Life
ABridge Advice If you’re staying on Vasilyevsky Island, remember that in the summer months the bridges go up at night. Dvortsovy most's timetable is up at 1.10am and down for 20 minutes at 2.50am before going up again until 4.55am. Blagoveshchensky most is crossable from 2.45am until 3.10am and then not again until 5am.
ACool Street Hang with the locals on 6-ya and 7-ya liniya, the main pedestrian and commercial street of Vasilyevsky Island. Lined with cafes, bars, restaurants and shops, this is where to escape the tourist crowds at the Strelka.

Getting There & Away
AMetro The most useful metro stations are Vasileostrovskaya on Line 3 at the island’s heart and the nab Makarova/1-ya i Kadetskaya liniya exit from Sportivnaya on Line 5.
ABus The number 7 bus goes between Primorskaya to pl Vosstaniya, via Nalichnaya ul, all of Bolshoy pr and Nevsky pr. Trolleybus 10 and 11 run similar routes.

The Krasin, built in 1917, has a history almost as volatile as the 20th century itself. The Arctic icebreaker was decommissioned in 1971, and can now be visited on a guided tour that leaves every hour on the hour from 11am to 5pm. Call ahead to book a tour in English or French. Special tours of the engine room (over 14s only) are available at 1pm and 3pm on Saturday and Sunday.
The Krasin was captured by the British in 1918, returned to the Soviet Union two years later and took part in a large number of Arctic missions and rescues in her long career. The Krasin is also the last surviving ship of the infamous PQ-15 convoy that sent aid from Britain to the USSR during WWII.

Designed by French architect Jean-Francois Thomas de Thomon, the Greek revival–style Stock Exchange was completed in 1810. It ceased to serve its original function following the 1917 revolution and for many years housed the Central Naval Museum. Currently closed, the plan is for this to become a branch of the Hermitage to house the museum's heraldry collection.

Bring your passport with you to access this small but interesting museum, which recounts the history of St Petersburg's metro. Sadly there's no signage in English, so this is strictly for enthusiasts, but there are nice touches, such as a metro escalator taking you between floors and a metro car and cab you can enter to 'drive' your own train.

The People’s Will (Narodovolets) D-2 Submarine was one of the first six diesel-fuelled submarines built in the Soviet Union and has been wonderfully preserved in this purpose-built museum. The sub itself saw action between 1931 and 1956, and sank five German ships during WWII. Today you can wander around its supremely well-preserved (yet totally antiquated) interior and look at its equipment and weaponry. There's also a small museum containing photos, models and paintings of other submarines, including the ill-fated Kursk.

The lacklustre decor may not instantly endear this Indian-run place to you, but its popularity with locals and visiting Indians says a great deal. The English-speaking owner will make you feel very welcome and the selection of delicious baltis, vindaloos, kadhai, biryanis and vegetarian dishes is impressive.

To fully take in the contemporary art collection at Erarta will take several hours, so it's handy that the museum's restaurant is a pretty good one that's worth building into your itinerary. The menu is fairly adventurous and includes well-made soups, light dishes such as barley risotto or hand-made truffle pasta, and desserts inspired by works of art.
The restaurant is also open on a Tuesday when the museum is closed.

Despite the laughable wax figure of a barely recognisable Pushkin with a quill in his hand at the entrance, ‘Peter’s City’ is a classy German restaurant and microbrewery with an impressive menu and cosy decor. There’s a separate bar where you can drink home-brewed lager, Weizen and Dunkel beers, while the menu is all about meat, and particularly sausages.
See if you can manage the metre-long Thüringer, served with onion sauce and red cabbage. Ask also for a free tour of the on-site microbrewery. There's live music Friday and Saturday from 8pm. In summer the outdoor tables offer amazing views of St Isaac’s Cathedral and the Admiralty across the Neva River.

LENGTH 2KM; TWO HOURS
The eastern nose of Vasilyevsky Island, the 1Strelka, boasts an unparalleled panorama, looking out over the Peter and Paul Fortress, the Hermitage, the Admiralty and St Isaac’s Cathedral. The red 2Rostral Columns frame the view; climb the steps of the 3Old Stock Exchange for a raised perspective.
Continue southwest, dropping into either the 4Museum of Zoology or the 5Kunstkamera, or both. The latter was Russia’s first museum, set up by Peter to dispel common superstitions about illness and disease and includes an infamous collection of deformed foetuses preserved in bottles.
At Peter’s behest, Domenico Trezzini built the magnificent 6Twelve Colleges, now St Petersburg State University, in 1722. The emperor based his bureaucracy here; separate entrances for each ministry signified their independence, while the unified facade highlighted collective goals. Now part of the university, you'll find here the small 7Mendeleev Museum, the beautiful university botanical gardens and a quirky collection of sculptures.
Peter originally gifted the entirety of Vasilyevsky Island to his best friend, Prince Menshikov, who proceeded to build the fabulous 8Menshikov Palace on the north bank of the Bolshaya Neva. Menshikov’s humble origins gave him a taste for opulence, and the interior is the best-preserved Petrine decor in the city.
Two Egyptian sphinx monuments mark the entrance to the institutional 9Academy of Arts Museum, which houses 250 years’ worth of artistic expression. On display are works created by academy students and faculty over the years, as well as temporary exhibitions. A beautiful old library – lined with dusty volumes and packed with dark wood furniture – is open for visiting researchers.
Head inland up 6-ya liniya i 7-ya liniya where you can pop briefly into the aPharmacy Museum of Dr Pelya to view the original 19th-century interior. Across Bolshoy pr, the street is pedestrianised and tree-lined, with the charming bSt Andrew's Cathedral on the corner. Enjoy something to eat along 6-ya liniya i 7-ya liniya before finally checking out the modern art of the cNovy Museum.

Petrograd & Vyborg Sides


Explore Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
Peter’s city was first founded on the Petrograd Side and it's a fascinating place packed with historical sites, stunning Style Moderne architecture and a couple of great live music venues. The showstopper of the area is the Peter & Paul Fortress, whose museums, soaring cathedral and panoramic views easily warrant a half- or a full-day visit. Afterwards, you could easily spend a few days taking in fascinating sights that see far fewer visitors such as the treasure-filled Hermitage Storage Facility and insightful house museums devoted to the likes of early 20th-century opera singer Chaliapin and Soviet party boss (and Stalinist victim) Kirov.
Aside from hitting the main sights, the Petrograd Side is a fine area for exploring. The main thoroughfare of Bolshoy pr is dotted with shops, restaurants and cafes, and you’ll find intriguing architecture scattered throughout the district. This area is also a fine destination when you need a break from the urban bustle. The wooded islands found here make a great retreat from the city streets, particularly Yelagin where you can hire boats and bicycles, and Krestovsky with its tree-lined lanes and sizeable amusement park.
Local Life
AParks If the weather’s good, join the locals as they take to the Kirovsky Islands for fairground rides, boating, sunbathing and cycling through the woods – it’s a total escape from the city, just three metro stops from the centre.
AStreet Art Check out the creative daubs of street artists on the walls around the shuttered Red Banner Textile Factory and the giant murals near Chkalovskaya metro.
AStrip off Stand next to the serious sunbathers tanning against the fortress walls or on the beach at Zayachy Island. For a year-round tropical holiday, splash around with crowds at Piterland water park.
Getting There & Away
AMetro The Petrograd Side is served by Gorkovskaya and Petrogradskaya on Line 2, and by Sportivnaya, Chkalovskaya and Krestovsky Ostrov on Line 5. The Vyborg Side has some 20 metro stations on it, mainly serving far-flung residential areas.
ABus Bus 10 runs from the Vyborg Side at Chyornaya Rechka, down Bolshoy pr on the Petrograd Side and on into the Historic Heart.
ATram Tram 6 provides a handy link between pl Lenina and Vasilyevsky Island via Kronverksky pr on the Petrograd Side, while tram 40 is also useful for traversing the Petrograd Side to Chyornaya Rechka.
AMarshrutka Marshrutka 346 runs the length of Bolshoy pr and then turns left onto Kamennoostrovsky pr and on to the Vyborg Side.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
This is the real St Petersburg – a far cry from the uniform beauty of the Historic Heart. The Petrograd Side is a good place to see the everyday life of the middle classes in the city and, while the Vyborg Side around pl Lenina is a vision of a post-industrial nightmare, your average Joes live in the Soviet housing estates further along the metro line – travel to the end of lines 1 or 2 and you’ll see real city life.

HISTORIC BUILDING
(Домик Петра Великого MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Petrovskaya nab 6; adult/student R200/100; h10am-6pm Wed & Fri-Mon, 1-9pm Thu; mGorkovskaya)
This charming log cottage, protected within a stone building, is St Petersburg’s oldest surviving structure. The wooden cabin itself was supposedly built in three days in May 1703 for Peter to live in while he supervised the construction of the fortress and city.
Feeling more like a shrine than a museum, the cabin confirms Peter’s love for the simple life with its unpretentious, homely feel, visibly influenced by the time he spent in Holland.
It has long been a sentimental site for St Petersburg. During WWII, Soviet soldiers would take an oath of allegiance to the city here, vowing to protect it from the Germans, before disappearing to the front. After the Siege of Leningrad, this was the first museum to reopen to the public.
Look out for the bronze bust of Peter by Parmen Zabello in the garden.

Lenin’s wife’s family lived in this apartment-turned-museum and VIadimir Ilyich himself laid low here before the revolution while organising the workers. The delightful turn-of-the-20th-century fittings have been preserved intact, including a telephone that still bears Lenin’s home phone number. By the look of things, Lenin had a very bourgeois time of it.
The apartment building, which is known locally as the ‘boat house’ due to its external similarities to a large cruise liner, was built in 1913 at the height of St Petersburg’s lust for Style Moderne. After finding the entrance, head up the stairs to the 3rd floor to be buzzed in.

This quirky little museum pays tribute to bread and the role it has played in history (of the city and of the world). A model bakery exhibits the equipment that was used to make bread for the city’s poorest classes in the 19th century. A special exhibition on the Siege of Leningrad offers a chilling example of a daily ration of bread during WWII, as well as rare photographs of starving children and bread queues.

Examples of the last include toys made in Sergiev Posad, home of the ubiquitous matryoshka (nesting doll), a creation often assumed to be far older than it is, being created for the first time only in the 19th century.

START PETER & PAUL FORTRESS (GORKOVSKAYA)
END ROSENSHTEIN APARTMENT BUILDING (PETROGRADSKAYA)
LENGTH 1.5KM; TWO HOURS
The Petrograd Side is an architectural treasure trove with buildings ranging from the time of St Petersburg's very inception up to contemporary times. Start with a quick tour of the city’s first defensive installation, the 1Peter & Paul Fortress. Don't miss the splendid 2SS Peter & Paul Cathedral, the last resting place of Peter the Great and almost every tsar since.
The central square of Peter’s early city, 3Troitskaya pl (Trinity Sq) formerly had as its centrepiece Trinity Cathedral, where Peter attended Mass. The cathedral was destroyed soon after the 1917 revolution but a small chapel remains on the spot.
Petrovskaya nab is home to two historic landmarks: 4Peter’s Cabin, the wooden hut that was the tsar's first modest home in the city; and, off the island’s eastern tip, the 5Cruiser Aurora, a legendary battleship which saw service in the Russo‑Japanese War.
Return to Kamennoostrovsky pr via ul Kuybysheva, passing the lovely Style Moderne palace of ballerina Mathilda Kshesinskaya that now houses the 6Museum of Political History, and the 7Mosque, coated in dazzling mosaics of aquatint tiles.
Continue north along Kamennoostrovsky pr to get a sense of Petrograd’s ever-growing vibrancy. Look closely for architectural gems around 8Avstriyskaya pl, with its castlelike edifices. Further along, if you want to get an idea of what one of these grand Style Moderne apartment blocks looks like inside, visit the 9Kirov Museum.
Ul Rentgena offers up more Style Moderne beauties: note the decoration on the facade of No 4 and make sure you do a full circle of the freestanding aChaev Mansion, which exhibits great geometric precision in its design.
Follow ul Lva Tolstogo towards the metro and you'll pass the whimsical, turretted bRosenshtein Apartment Building (also know as the Tower House). Designed by Andrey Belogrud, this mash-up of neoclassical and neo-Gothic styles now houses a theatre.

This light-blue baroque cathedral dates from 1740, and having been repainted and restored to its original glory both inside and out, glistens like a pearl amid a gritty industrial area. Its most interesting feature is the calendar of saints, two enormous panels on either side of the nave, each representing six months of the year, where every day is decorated with a mini-icon of its saint(s).
The enormous silver chandelier above the altar is also something to behold, as is the stunning baroque, green-and-golden iconostasis. Don’t miss the frieze of a young Peter the Great, on the wall behind you when you face the main iconostasis.
This is also believed to be the church where Catherine the Great married her one-eyed lover Grigory Potemkin in a secret ceremony in 1774.

(Пискарёвское мемориальное кладбище GOOGLE MAP ; www.pmemorial.ru; pr Nepokoryonnikh 72; h9am-9pm May-Oct, to 6pm Nov-Apr; mPloshchad Muzhestva)
The main burial place for the victims of the Nazi blockade in WWII is a stark and poignant memorial to the tragedy. Some half a million people were laid to rest here between 1941 and 1943, during the siege.
From metro station Ploshchad Muzhestva, take marshrutka 123 in the direction of Ladozhskaya metro, which passes by the entrance to the cemetery.
Originally, this area was just an enormous pit where unnamed and unmarked bodies were dumped. In 1960 the remodelled cemetery was opened and has been an integral part of the city’s soul ever since. Every year on Victory Day (9 May) the cemetery is packed out with mourners, many of whom survived the blockade or lost close relatives to starvation.
FINLAND STATIONHISTORIC BUILDING
(Finlyandsky vokzal; Финляндский вокзал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Lenina 6; mPloshchad Lenina)
Rebuilt in the 1970s in rectilinear Soviet style, the Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal) endures as a place of historical significance, where Lenin finally arrived in 1917 after 17 years in exile abroad. Here he gave his legendary speech from the top of an armoured car to a crowd who had heard of, but never seen, the man.
After fleeing a second time he again arrived here from Finland, this time disguised as a railway fireman, and the locomotive he rode in is displayed behind glass on the platform.
Walk out onto the square that still bears Lenin’s name and you’ll see a marvellous statue of the man himself at the far end.

Russia’s poetic genius, Alexander Pushkin, was fatally wounded in a duel here with the Frenchman Georges d’Anthès on 8 February 1837. A granite monument marks the alleged spot, today a small park surrounded by fast-moving traffic.
From the metro station at Chyornaya Rechka, walk down Torzhkovskaya ul and turn left at the first light on Novosibirskaya ul. Walk straight to the end of the road, cross the train tracks and enter the park.

Day Trips from St Petersburg

Peterhof
The most popular day trip from St Petersburg is to Peter the Great’s spectacular summer palace and grounds on the Gulf of Finland, easily reached from central St Petersburg by hydrofoil from outside the Admiralty.
Pushkin & Pavlovsk
Tsarskoe Selo (in the town of Pushkin) and Pavlovsk are two beautiful palaces and grounds next door to one another. This is a great day trip to see the summer palaces of Catherine the Great and Paul I.
Vyborg
Situated on the Gulf of Finland, this appealing town is features a medieval castle and an abundance of art-nouveau buildings. An easy day trip from St Petersburg, Vyborg offers enough for longer stays.
Repino
Part of Finland in the mid-20th-century, this village has long back in Russian hands and makes for a pleasant, outdoorsy day trip from St Petersburg.
Kronshtadt
Closed to foreigners until 1996, Kronshtadt's offering of history, cruises and naval might makes for a fascinating day trip destination.


TOP SIGHT
PETERHOF
The fountains are incredible, the palace is a stunner and the grounds are great for walking, so it’s no surprise that Peter the Great’s summer palace is usually the first-choice day trip for visitors to St Petersburg. Peterhof is no secret, however, so come early in the day or out of season to enjoy it without the crowds.

Peter's Summer Palace
Hugging the Gulf of Finland, 29km west of St Petersburg, Peterhof – the ‘Russian Versailles’ – is a far cry from the original cabin Peter the Great had built here to oversee construction of the Kronshtadt naval base. Peter liked the place so much he built a villa, Monplaisir, here and then a whole series of palaces and ornate gardens. Peterhof was renamed Petrodvorets (Peter’s Palace) in 1944 but has since reverted to its original name. The palace and buildings are surrounded by leafy gardens and a spectacular ensemble of gravity-powered fountains.
What you see today is largely a reconstruction, as Peterhof was a major casualty of WWII. Apart from the damage done by the Germans, the palace suffered the worst under Soviet bombing raids in December 1941 and January 1942, because Stalin was determined to thwart Hitler’s plan of hosting a New Year’s victory celebration here.
The Lower Park
The Lower Park contains most of Peterhof’s sights and is where you will arrive if you take the hydrofoil from St Petersburg to get here. Forming the lion’s share of the palace grounds, it boasts an incredible symphony of gravity-powered golden fountains, beautiful waterways and interesting historical buildings, making it one of St Petersburg’s most dazzling attractions.
Criss-crossed by bridges and bedecked by smaller sprays, Water Avenue ( GOOGLE MAP ; hMay-Sep) is a canal leading from the hydrofoil dock to the palace. It culminates in the magnificent Grand Cascade, a symphony of over 140 fountains engineered in part by Peter himself. The central statue of Samson tearing open a lion’s jaws celebrates – as so many things in St Petersburg do – Peter’s victory over the Swedes at Poltava. Shooting up 62m, it was unveiled by Rastrelli for the 25th anniversary of the battle in 1735.
Grand Palace
The Grand Palace is an imposing edifice, although with 30-something rooms, it’s not as large as many tsarist palaces. From the start of June to the end of September foreign tourists can visit only between 10.30am and noon, and again from 2.30pm until 4.15pm, due to guided tours being given only in Russian at other times. (While you have to enter the palace as part of a guided tour, it’s quite possible to slip away.)
While Peter’s palace was relatively modest, Rastrelli grossly enlarged the building for Empress Elizabeth. Later, Catherine the Great toned things down a little with a redecoration, although that’s not really apparent from the glittering halls and art-filled galleries that are here today. All of the paintings, furniture and chandeliers are original, as everything was removed from the premises before the Germans arrived in WWII. The Chesme Hall is full of huge paintings of Russia’s destruction of the Turkish fleet at Çesme in 1770. Other highlights include the exquisite East and West Chinese Cabinets, Peter’s study and the Picture Hall, which lives up to its name, with hundreds of portraits crowding its walls. The Throne Room is the biggest in the palace, and the centrepiece is Peter’s red velvet throne.
After WWII, Peterhof was largely left in ruins. Hitler had intended to throw a party here when his plans to occupy the Astoria Hotel were thwarted. He drew up pompous invitations, which obviously incensed his Soviet foes. Stalin’s response was to preempt any such celebration by bombing the estate himself, in the winter of 1941–42, so it is ironic but true that most of the damage at Peterhof occurred at the hands of the Soviets.
Monplaisir
This far more humble, sea-facing villa was always Peter the Great’s favourite retreat. It’s easy to see why: Monplaisir (Монплезир GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm late May-early Oct) is wood panelled, snug and elegant, peaceful even when there’s a crowd – which there used to be all the time, what with Peter’s mandatory partying (‘misbehaving’ guests were required to gulp down huge quantities of wine).
Also in this complex is an annexe called the Catherine Building (Екатерининский корпус GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm), which was built by Rastrelli between 1747 and 1755. Its name derives from the fact that Catherine the Great was living in this building when her husband Peter III was overthrown,and it was from here that she set out for the capital to assume the Russian throne. The interior contains the bedroom and study of Alexander I, as well as the huge Yellow Hall. On the right side is the magnificent Bath Building (Банный корпус GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Thu-Tue), built by Quarenghi in 1800, which is nothing special inside.Look out for some more trick fountains in the garden in front of the buildings.

Hermitage
Along the shore to the west, the 1725 Hermitage (Эрмитаж GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R400/250; h10.30am-6pm Wed-Mon May-Oct) is a two-storey yellow-and-white box featuring the ultimate in private dining: special elevators hoist a fully laid table into the imperial presence on the 2nd floor, thereby eliminating any hindrance by servants. The elevators are circular and located directly in front of each diner, whose plate would be lowered, replenished and replaced. The device is demonstrated on Saturdays and Sundays at 1pm, 2pm and 3pm. Further west is yet another palace, Marly, inspired by the Versailles hunting lodge of the same name so loved by Louis XIV.

Cloche fountain, Monplaisir | svetlanak/GETTY IMAGES ©
Park Alexandria
Even on summer weekends, the rambling and overgrown Park Alexandria (Парк Александрия GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R300/200; h9am-10pm) is peaceful and practically empty. Built for Tsar Nicholas I (and named for his tsarina), these grounds offer a sweet retreat from the crowds. Originally named for Alexander Nevsky, the gothic chapel ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R300/200; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun) was completed in 1834 as the private chapel of Nicholas I. Nearby is the cottage (Коттедж GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun) that was built around the same time as his summer residence. Also part of this same ensemble is the beautifully restored Farmer’s Palace (Фермерский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R600/350; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun), built here in 1831 as a pavilion in the park and designed to reify pastoral fantasies of rural life for the royal family. It became the home of the teenage Tsarevitch Alexander (later Alexander II), who loved it throughout his life.
Peterhof Town
Outside the palace grounds is the handsome St Peter & Paul Cathedral (Петропавловский собор GOOGLE MAP ; Sankt-Petersburgsky pr; h9am-7pm), and, continuing around the edge of Olgin Prud (Olga’s Pond), the Tsaritsyn and Olgin Pavilions ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R700/400; h10.30am-6pm, last entry 4pm), two buildings sitting on islands in the middle of the pond. Nicholas I had these elaborate pavilions built for his wife (Alexandra Fyodorovna) and daughter (Olga Nikolayevna) respectively. Only recently restored and reopened, they boast unique Mediterranean architectural styles reminiscent of Pompeii.
Further down Sankt-Petersburgsky pr is the Raketa Petrodvorets Watch Factory ( GOOGLE MAP ; %926-304 05 91; www.raketa.com; Sankt-Petersburgsky pr 60; h9am-6pm Mon-Fri), one of the town’s biggest employers, which has an on-site shop selling very cool watches.
TICKETS FOR PETERHOF

On arrival, you’ll need to pay to enter the grounds of the palace, known as the Lower Park, and then for each additional sight within it. Sadly, however, it’s not cheap, as you’re paying more than locals and the sights add up, so choose what you want to see carefully. Inexplicably, many museums also have different closing days, although all buildings are open Friday to Sunday. Nearly all tours and posted information are in Russian, so buy an information booklet at the kiosks near the entrances or, in the Grand Palace, take an English-language audio guide. Online tickets can be purchased for the Grand Palace at www.peterhofmuseum.ru, which can avoid long lines in the summer months.
HYDROFOIL

From May to September, the Peterhof Express ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhof-express.com; single/return adult R800/1500, student R600/1000; h10am-6pm) hydrofoil departs from the jetty in front of the Admiralty every 30 minutes from 9am. It’s an expensive but highly enjoyable way to get to Peterhof, and you arrive right in front of the palace. The last hydrofoil leaves Peterhof at 7pm, and the trip takes 30 minutes.
Even though the hydrofoil is fast and convenient, it’s rather expensive. You can save money by getting here by marshrutka. Marshrutky 300,424 and 424A (R80) leave from outside the Avtovo metro station. All pass through the town of Peterhof, immediately outside the palace. Tell the driver you want to go ‘v dvaryéts’ (‘to the palace’) and you’ll be let off near the main entrance to the Upper Garden, on Sankt-Petersburgsky pr.
TRAIN

There’s also a reasonably frequent suburban train (R60, 40 minutes) from Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) to Novy Peterhof, from where you can walk (around 30 minutes) or take any bus except 357 to the fifth stop, which will take another 10 minutes.
NEED TO KNOW

Peterhof is 29km west of St Petersburg.
In the Lower Park itself, the best eating options are the Grand Orangerie ( GOOGLE MAP ; Lower Park; set menus R450-800; h11am-8pm), a cafe in the former palace orangery. Outside the palace grounds, try the appealing Duck & Drake inside the New Peterhof Hotel ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-319 1010; www.new-peterhof.com; Sankt Peterburgsky pr 34; s/d from R5000/5900; Ws), where you can eat Russian and European fare (mains R520 to R950).
TOP TIP

Remember to bring mosquito repellent or to keep your legs and arms covered if you’re here during summer; the mosquitoes on the palace grounds are fierce.

PUSHKIN & PAVLOVSK
The sumptuous palaces and sprawling parks at Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk are, thanks to Catherine the Great and Pushkin, entrenched in Russian history and immortalised in literature. These two neighbouring complexes can be combined in a day’s visit – although if you’re not in the mood to rush, there is plenty at both of them to keep you entertained for an entire day.

The Parks
Almost adjacent yet very different in style and design, Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk are both huge imperial estates with impressive gardens, palaces and various other embellishments. Both also have towns that have grown up around them over the centuries. (The town surrounding Tsarskoe Selo was originally called Tsarskoe Selo, too, but changed its name to Pushkin in 1937.)
Tsarskoe Selo (the ‘tsar’s village’) is understandably the big hitter of the two thanks to the beautiful Catherine Palace and its sumptuous grounds. Pavlovsk, just a short bus ride away, is far less visited and much quieter as a result, but its grounds are wilder and arguably even more lovely, and make for a perfect place to get lost in.
Catherine Palace
The centrepiece of Tsarskoe Selo, created under Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine the Great between 1744 and 1796, is the vast baroque Catherine Palace (Екатерининский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; www.tzar.ru; Sadovaya ul 7; adult/student R1000/350, audio guide R150; h10am-4.45pm Wed-Sun), designed by Rastrelli and named after Peter the Great’s second wife. From May to September the palace can only be visited by individuals between noon and 2pm and 4pm and 5pm, otherwise it’s reserved for prebooked tour groups, such is its rightful popularity. The audio guide is well worth taking, as it gives detailed explanations of what you’ll see in each room.
As at the Winter Palace, Catherine the Great had many of Rastrelli’s original interiors remodelled in classical style. Most of the gaudy exterior and 20-odd rooms of the palace have been beautifully restored – compare them to the photographs of the devastation left by the Germans.
The interiors are superb, with highlights including the Great Hall, the Arabesque Hall, the baroque Cavalier’s Dining Room, the White State Dining Room, the Crimson and Green Pilaster Rooms, the Portrait Hall and, of course, the world-famous Amber Room. The panels used in the Amber Room were a gift given to Peter the Great, but not put to any use until 1743 when Elizabeth decided to use them decoratively, after which they were ingeniously incorporated into the walls here. What you see is a reconstruction of the original that disappeared during WWII and is believed to have been destroyed.
Catherine Park
The lovely Catherine Park (Екатерининский парк GOOGLE MAP ; May-Sep R120, Oct-Apr free; h9am-6pm), with its main entrance on Sadovaya ul next to the palace chapel, surrounds the Catherine Palace. It extends around the ornamental Great Pond and contains an array of interesting buildings, follies and pavilions. Near the Catherine Palace, the Cameron Gallery has rotating exhibitions. The park’s outer section focuses on the Great Pond. In summer you can take a ferry boat to the little island to visit the Chesme Column ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R250/150; h11am-6pm May-Sep), a monument to Russia’s victory over the Turkish fleet. Beside the pond, the blue baroque Grotto Pavilion ( GOOGLE MAP ; h10am-5pm Fri-Wed) houses temporary exhibitions in summer. A walk around the Great Pond will reveal other buildings that the royals built over the years, including the very incongruous-looking Turkish Bath with its minaret-style tower, the wonderful Marble Bridge, the Chinese Pavilion and a Concert Hall isolated on an island.
Alexander Palace & Park
A short distance north of the Catherine Palace, and surrounded by the overgrown and tranquil Alexander Park (Александровский парк GOOGLE MAP ; h7am-11pm), is the classical Alexander Palace (Александровский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovaya ul 2). This palace, built by Quarenghi between 1792 and 1796 for the future Alexander I, was the favourite residence of Nicholas II, the last Russian tsar. Only a few rooms are open to visitors, but they’re impressive, with a huge tiger-skin carpet and an extremely ropey portrait of a young Queen Victoria to boot. It’s a poignant and forgotten place that doesn’t get many tourists and is a welcome contrast to the Catherine Palace.
Pavlovsk Great Palace
Between 1781 and 1786, on orders from Catherine the Great, architect Charles Cameron designed the Pavlovsk Great Palace (Большой Павловский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; www.pavlovskmuseum.ru; ul Sadovaya 20; adult/child R600/250; h10am-6pm, closed Tue, Fri & 1st Mon of month) in Pavlovsk. The palace was designated for Catherine’s son Paul (hence the name, Pavlovsk), and it was Paul’s second wife, Maria Fyodorovna, who orchestrated the design of the interiors. Tragically, the original palace was burnt down two weeks after the end of WWII when the cigarette of a careless Soviet soldier set off German mines (the Soviets blamed the Germans). As at Tsarskoe Selo, the restoration is remarkable.
The finest rooms are on the middle floor of the central block. Cameron designed the round Italian Hall beneath the dome and the Grecian Hall to its west, though the lovely green fluted columns were added by his assistant, Vincenzo Brenna. Flanking these are two private suites designed mainly by Brenna: Paul’s along the north side of the block and Maria Fyodorovna’s on the south. The Hall of War of the insane, military-obsessed Paul contrasts with Maria’s Hall of Peace, decorated with musical instruments and flowers. On the middle floor of the south block are Paul’s Throne Room and the Hall of the Maltese Knights of St John, of whom he was the Grand Master.

Pavlovsk Great Park
If you decide to skip the palace, you may simply wish to wander around the serene Pavlovsk Great Park – and as you’ll have to pay to enter them just to access the palace, it’s worth exploring and seeing what you come across.

THE MYSTERY OF THE AMBER ROOM

The original Amber Room was created from exquisitely engraved amber panels given to Peter the Great by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia in 1716. Rastrelli later combined the panels with gilded woodcarvings, mirrors, agate and jasper mosaics to decorate one of the rooms of the Catherine Palace. Plundered by the Nazis during WWII, the room’s decorative panels were last exhibited in Königsberg’s castle in 1941. Four years later, with the castle in ruins, the Amber Room was presumed destroyed. Or was it?
In 2004, as Putin and then German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder presided over the opening of the new US$18 million Amber Room, restored largely with German funds, rumours about the original panels continued to swirl. There are those who believe that parts, if not all, of the original Amber Room remain hidden away somewhere and have survived (see www.amberroom.org).

Vyborg
Explore
This appealing Gulf of Finland provincial town is dominated by a medieval castle and peppered with beautiful Finnish art nouveau buildings and romantic cobblestone streets.
The border has jumped back and forth around Vyborg for most of its history. Peter the Great captured it from the Swedes in 1710. A century later it fell within autonomous Finland, and after the revolution Vyborg remained part of independent Finland. Since then the Finns have called it Viipuri. Stalin took Vyborg in 1939, lost it to the Finns during WWII, and on getting it back at the end of the war deported all the Finns. Today the Finns are back by the coachloads for sightseeing and carousing on the weekends.

ATrain Elektrichki (R301, 2½ hours, hourly) leave from St Petersburg’s Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal). Of these, there are also a handful of express services (R331, 1¼ hours, four daily), or the far more expensive Helsinki-bound trains, which stop in Vyborg (R2236, one hour).
ABus Services to/from St Petersburg (R280, to/from either metro stations Devyatkino or Parnas) run every 20 minutes from 6.30am to 8pm. Theoretically, travel time is around 2¼ hours, but the traffic can lengthen this, so the train remains the best option.

Rising stoutly from an islet in Vyborg Bay, this castle was built by the Swedes in 1293 when they first captured Karelia from Novgorod. Most of it now consists of 16th-century alterations. The castle contains several exhibition halls, including a mildly diverting small museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; R100; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun) on local history, but the main attraction is climbing the many steps of whitewashed St Olaf’s Tower ( GOOGLE MAP ) for commanding views over the town (closed for renovations at time of research).

A must-see for architecture fans is the beautifully designed public library, one of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto's iconic designs. After years of restoration, the 1935 building looks lovelier than ever, with painstaking efforts to return it to Aalto's original vision. Handmade bronze-handled doors, circular skylights in the reading room, and elegant birchwood shelves are among the many features. It's still a working public library, open to all (though oddly, it lacks wi-fi).

Come summer, Petersburgers stream out of the city to relax on the beaches to the north between Sestroretsk and Zelenogorsk on the Gulf of Finland. Between these two towns you’ll find the village of Repino, 45km from St Petersburg. From 1918 to the end of WWII, this area was part of Finland and the village was known as Kuokkala. In 1948, back in Russian hands, the village was renamed in honour of its most famous resident, Ilya Repin.

Repin bought land here in 1899, named the estate after a Roman household god and designed the light-flooded house in an arts-and-crafts style. The artist produced many of his later works here, and several of his paintings still hang on the walls. The furnishings have been left just as they were during Repin’s residence, which was up to his death in 1930. His grave, marked by a simple Russian Orthodox wooden cross, is in the park, along with a couple of wooden follies also designed by Repin.

With its grand cathedral, waterfront parks and pretty canal-lined avenues, Kronshtadt makes for a fascinating half-day visit. Aside from taking in one grand neo-Byzantine church and visiting a little-visited corner of greater St Petersburg, this is a fine place for seeing Russia’s mighty naval centre, and getting an overview of the bay on a boat tour.
Within a year of founding St Petersburg, Peter – desirous of protecting his new Baltic toehold – started work on the fortress of Kronshtadt on Kotlin Island, 29km out in the Gulf of Finland. It’s been a pivotal Soviet and Russian naval base ever since, and was closed to foreigners until 1996.

KRONSHTADT REBELLION

In 1921 the hungry and poor Red Army sailors stationed here organised an ill-fated mutiny against the Bolsheviks. They set up a Provisional Revolutionary Committee and drafted a resolution demanding, among other things, an end to Lenin’s harsh War Communism. On 16 March 1921 the mutineers were defeated when 50,000 troops crossed the ice from Petrograd and massacred nearly the entire naval force. The sailors’ stand wasn’t entirely in vain, as afterwards Lenin did scrap War Communism.





Transport

ARRIVING IN ST PETERSBURG
St Petersburg is well connected to the rest of Europe by plane, train, ferry and bus. The vast majority of travellers arrive in St Petersburg by air at Pulkovo Airport. Flight time from London and Paris to St Petersburg is three hours, from Berlin it’s a two-hour flight, and from Moscow it’s under an hour.
Train is also a popular way to get here – from Moscow there are pleasantly slow overnight sleeper trains as well as six to eight fast four-hour daytime Sapsan trains. See www.rzd.ru for details. From Helsinki there are four daily Allegro express trains that take you from the Finnish capital to St Petersburg in an impressive 3½ hours. See www.vr.fi for prices and timetables.
An increasing number of travellers arrive at one of St Petersburg’s five cruise and ferry terminals. There are regular connections between St Petersburg and Stockholm (22 to 24 hours), Tallinn (14 hours) and Helsinki (10 hours). Those who arrive this way also have the option of 72-hour visa-free travel. See St Peter Line for prices and timetables.
Flights, cars and tours can be booked online at lonelyplanet.com.
Pulkovo International Airport
Most travellers arrive in St Petersburg at Pulkovo International Airport (LED; GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 3822; www.pulkovoairport.ru; Pulkovskoye sh), 23km south of the city. This terminal building, which opened in 2014, and is confusingly still referred to as Terminal 1, handles all domestic and international flights and is St Petersburg's only airport.
Taxi
Taking a taxi from the airport to the city centre has never been easier or safer. Leave the terminal building and outside you'll find an official taxi dispatcher who will ask you for your destination's address, indicate which taxi to go to and write you a price on a slip of official paper that you can then give to your driver. Prices vary, but expect to pay between R800 and R1000 to reach the centre, depending on where exactly you’re headed. Drivers usually won’t speak much English, so just hand over the money on arrival – you don’t need to tip. It's also possible to book a trip into the city via a taxi app for around R700.
Marshrutka & Bus
For those on a budget, marshrutka (minibus) K39 shuttles you from outside the terminal building to the nearest metro station, Moskovskaya (R35, every five minutes, from 7am to 11.30pm). The bus terminates at the Moskovskaya metro station, so you don’t need to worry about where to get off, and you can connect to the rest of the city from there.
There's also bus 39 (R40, every 15 minutes, from 5.30am to 1.30am) that runs the same route over longer hours, but trundles along somewhat more slowly.
Moscow Station
If you’re arriving from Moscow, you’ll come to the Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal; Московский вокзал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.moskovsky-vokzal.ru; Nevsky pr 85; mPloshchad Vosstaniya) (Moskovsky vokzal), in the centre of the city. There are two metro stations close by: pl Vosstaniya (Line 1) and Mayakovskaya (Line 3). To get here (you can enter both stations through one building) turn left outside the main entrance to the Moscow Station, and the exit is in one side of the building on Ligovsky pr.
Finland Station
Trains from Helsinki arrive at the Finland Station (Финляндский вокзал; Finlyandsky vokzal MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.finlyandsky.dzvr.ru; pl Lenina 6; mPloshchad Lenina) (Finlyandsky vokzal). From here you can connect to anywhere in the city by metro from the Ploshchad Lenina station (Line 1) on the square outside the station.
Ladoga Station
Some trains from the Leningradskaya Oblast and those from Helsinki to Moscow stop en route in St Petersburg at the Ladoga Station (Ladozhsky vokzal; Ладожский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://lvspb.ru; Zanevsky pr 73; mLadozhskaya) (Ladozhsky vokzal). It’s served by the Ladozhskaya metro station (Line 4).
BUYING TICKETS IN ST PETERSBURG

You’ll most likely have your onward travel tickets when you arrive in St Petersburg, but if not it’s easy to purchase tickets for boat, bus, train and plane travel. First of all, try online – you can buy train tickets (www.rzd.ru), bus tickets (www.luxexpress.eu) and, of course, airline tickets via websites.
Buying train tickets in person can be done at any train station (even at a different terminus from where your train departs), although waiting time can be long if you buy them at a counter. Far quicker are the new ticket machines, which all work in English and where you can usually pay with either cash or credit card. Another option is the centrally located Train Tickets Centre (Кассы ЖД MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab kanala Griboyedova 24; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, until 6pm Sun; mGostiny Dvor), where there are also ticket machines, which makes waiting in line unnecessary.
You can buy ferry tickets for nearly all boats at the Ferry Centre (Паромный центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-327 3377; www.paromy.ru; ul Vosstaniya 19; h10am-7pm Mon-Fri; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), a short walk from the Moscow Station. Alternatively, it’s possible to buy ferry tickets in the Sea Port at the far-flung end of Vasilyevsky Island, as well as online through the ferry companies themselves.
If time is tight, then nearly all travel agencies can organise onward travel tickets for you, although of course there’s usually a markup on the cost and a delivery fee.
Bus Station
St Petersburg’s main bus station, Avtovokzal (Автобусный вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; %812-766 5777; www.avokzal.ru; nab Obvodnogo kanala 36; mObvodny Kanal), has bus connections to cities all over western Russia, including Veliky Novgorod, but most travellers won’t use it. If you do happen to arrive here, it’s a short walk along the canal to the metro station Obvodny Kanal (Line 5).
Sea Ports
There are a number of places where cruise ships arrive in St Petersburg, while all ferries from elsewhere in the Baltic arrive at the Sea Port on Vasilyevsky Island. Anyone on a river cruise from Moscow will arrive at the River Passenger Terminal in the south of the city, which is a short walk away from the Proletarskaya metro station (Line 3). Upon leaving the metro turn right onto pr Obukhovskoy Oborony and it’s five minutes up the road.
Marine Facade Terminal
The Marine Facade Terminal at the far end of Vasilyevsky Island is a relatively new facility. It’s not in the city centre, but all shore excursion operators have buses or cars for their passengers, and the journey to the Hermitage can be done in 30 minutes. The nearest metro station is Primorskaya, from where it’s just two stops to Gostiny Dvor (Line 3) in the Historic Heart, but it's a good 30-minute walk away and you'd be advised to arrange a taxi. Head down the main road from the Marine Facade, then once you’ve crossed Nalichnaya ul, take Novosmolenskaya nab and you’ll reach the station.
For taxis, an official dispatch stand is in the arrivals area, with fixed rates to various places around town. You’ll be given a slip of paper with the price you need to pay the driver: prices average from R200 to R400 depending on where in the centre you want to go.
Sea Port
If you’re arriving by ferry from Stockholm, Tallinn or Helsinki then you’ll disembark at the Sea Port in the southern corner of Vasilyevsky Island. It’s not served by the metro, so your easiest way into the city centre is to take a taxi. Drivers wait outside the terminal or you can order a taxi by phone app; prices average from R200 to R400 depending on where in the centre you want to go.
An alternative option is to take bus 7 (R40) from the main road outside. The bus should have pl Vosstaniya (Пл Восстания) written on it, and it goes all the way down Sredny pr, crosses the Neva at the Hermitage and then goes down Nevsky pr to pl Vosstaniya.
St Peter Line offers a €25 'tour package' bus service that shuttles passengers to St Isaac's Cathedral and back again every hour.
Other Ports
There are three other docks where cruise ships sometimes arrive in St Petersburg. Smaller cruise ships usually dock on either the English Embankment Passenger Terminal or the Lieutenant Schmidt Passenger Terminal. Neither terminal has much in the way of facilities, but both are centrally located and you’re within easy walking distance of the sights in the Historic Heart.
One far less attractive possibility is docking at the St Petersburg Sea Port, which is the main commercial and industrial port in the city. It’s on Gutuyevsky Island and a long way from anything. It’s technically possible to walk out of the port to the Narvskaya metro station, but reckon on a 30-minute walk through a fairly miserable industrial area. If you decide to walk, head up Obvodny Canal and then turn right onto Staropetrogovsky pr and you’ll see Narvskaya metro station on pl Stachek.
GETTING AROUND
Metro Fastest way to cover long distances. Has around 70 stations and runs from approximately 5.45am to 12.45am.
Bus, Trolleybus & Marshrutky Buses are best for shorter distances in areas without good metro coverage; they can be slow going, but the views are good. Trolleybuses are slower still, but are cheap and plentiful. Marshrutky are the private sector's contribution – fast fixed-route minibuses that you can get on or off anywhere along their routes.
Tram Largely obsolete and little used, but still useful in areas such as Kolomna and Vasilyevsky Island where there is little else available.
Metro
The St Petersburg Metro (%8-800- 350 1155; www.metro.spb.ru; h6am-12.45am) is a very efficient five-line system. The network of some 70 stations is most usefully employed for travelling long distances, especially connecting the suburbs to the city centre. New stations are being added and it's possible that the one at Teatralnaya, next to the Mariinsky Theatre, will be operational by 2020.
Look for signs with a big blue ‘M’ signifying the entrance to the metro. The flat fare for a trip is R45; you will have to buy an additional ticket if you are carrying a significant amount of baggage. If you wish to buy a single journey, ask for ‘adin proyezd’ and you will be given a zheton (token) to put in the machine.
If you are staying more than a day or two, however, it’s worth buying a smart card (R60), which is good for multiple journeys to be used over the course of a fixed time period – for example, 10 trips in seven days for R355. Their main advantage is that you won’t have to line up to buy tickets – the ticket counters can have very long lines during peak hours.
The metro system is fully signed in English, so it’s quite easy to use, even for first-timers in Russia.
Bus, Marshrutka & Trolleybus
Buses, and particularly marshrutky (minibuses), are a very handy way to get around the city and they tend to cover routes that the metro doesn’t, making them essential for certain parts of town. Most travellers find taking them a bit daunting, however, as there’s little signage in English. On both buses and trolleybuses, you get on and then pay a conductor; the fare is R40.
Marshrutky can be flagged down anywhere along their route (there are no bus stops for marshrutky). Open the door yourself and jump in, then once you’ve taken your seat you pay the driver (pass the money via your fellow passengers if you’re not sitting within reaching distance); the rates are usually posted on the inside of the bus near the driver. You’ll also need to request the stop you want – usually announcing to the driver the name of the street or the place you’re going to shortly before you get there. Alternatively, when you want to get off, simply say (or shout!): ‘AstanavEEtye pazhalsta!’ ('Stop please!') and the driver will pull over as soon as possible.
Taxi
Taxi apps, such as Gett and Yandex Taxi, are all the rage in St Petersburg and they've brought down the prices of taxis in general, while improving the service a great deal.
Aside from the apps, the best way to get a taxi is to order it by phone. Operators will usually not speak English, so unless you speak Russian, ask your hotel reception to call a taxi for you. It also remains possible to flag down a random car in the street and negotiate the price, keeping in mind all security caveats.

BRIDGE TIMETABLE

From mid-April until late November major bridges across the Neva rise at the following times overnight to allow ships to pass through the city. It's rare that the Grenadersky, Kantemirovsky and Sampsonievsky Bridges over the Bolshaya Nevka River (connecting the Vyborg and Petrograd Sides) are raised and, if so, two days' notice is given beforehand. You can check the full, up-to-date timetable at www.razvodka-mostov.ru (in Russian only).
Because of the new fixed suspension bridges on the Western High Speed Diameter highway across the mouth of the Neva you will not be stuck either side of the river when the bridges go up. Note also that between May and the end of November the M5 metro line shuttles every 20 minutes back and forth between Admiralteyskaya and Sportivnaya stations between 1am and 3am on Saturday and Sunday and the eve of public holidays, creating an easy way to get between the islands and the Historic Heart.
