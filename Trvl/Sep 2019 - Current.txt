Perpignan
This far south, climate and geography alone would ensure a palpable Spanish influence. Moreover, a good part of PERPIGNAN’s population is of Spanish origin – refugees from the Civil War and their descendants. The southern influence is further augmented by a substantial contingent of North Africans, including both Arabs and white French settlers repatriated after Algerian independence in 1962. Given its relatively grubby appearance, few will want to stay here for more than a day or two; if you have your own transport, you may prefer to base yourself somewhere in the surrounding area.

Casa Païral
Place de Verdun • 10.30am–6pm; closed Mon & bank holidays • €2 •  04 68 35 42 05
The best place to begin explorations of Perpignan is at Le Castillet, built as a gateway in the fourteenth century and now home to the Casa Païral, an interesting museum of Roussillon’s Catalan rural culture and the anti-French rebellions of 1661–74, when the tower held captured Catalan insurgents.
Place de la Loge
A short distance from place de Verdun down rue Louis-Blanc lies place de la Loge, focus of the pedestrianized heart of the old town, with a voluptuous Venus statue by Aristide Maillol in the centre. Dominating the cafés and brasseries of the narrow square is Perpignan’s most interesting building, the Gothic Loge de Mer (1397). Designed to hold the city’s stock exchange and maritime court, it features gargoyles, lancet windows and lacy balustrades up top. Adjacent stand the sixteenth-century hôtel de ville, with its magnificent wrought-iron gates and with another Maillol (La Méditerranée) in the courtyard, and the fifteenth-century Palais de la Députation, once the parliament of Roussillon.
Cathédrale St-Jean-Baptiste
Place Gambetta • Mon–Sat 8am–6pm (closes 7pm June–Sept), Sun 2–6pm • Free • Campo Santo Oct–April Tues–Sun 11am–5pm; closed May–Sept
From place de la Loge, rue St-Jean leads northeast to the fourteenth-century Cathédrale St-Jean on place Gambetta, its external walls built of alternating bands of river stones and brick. The dimly lit interior is most interesting for its elaborate Catalan altarpieces and for the fourteenth-century, Rhenish polychrome Crucifixion known as the Dévôt Christ; it’s in the fifth side chapel along the north wall, and was probably brought from the Low Countries by a travelling merchant. Out of the side door, a few steps on the left, you’ll find the entrance to the Campo Santo, a vast enclosure that’s one of France’s oldest cemeteries, occasionally used for summer concerts.
CATALAN CUISINE
Characterized by the wide variety of ingredients that grow throughout the different climates between the mountains and the sea, Catalonia’s distinctive food depends on its use of contrasting (sweet, savoury and sour) flavours within the five fundamental sauces of Catalan cuisine. The most important of these is sofregit, a tomato-based sauce with caramelized onion that’s used ubiquitously. The most popular traditional dishes include ollada (pork stew), bullinada (similar to paella but with potatoes instead of rice) and regional favourite, Boles de Picolat (meatballs). Catalans have a sweet tooth too and produce a variety of custardy desserts like Pa d’ous (flan) and crema catalane as well as the wonderful sweet wines of Banyuls and Rivesaltes.
The Maghrebian and Romany quarters
South of the cathedral, rue de la Révolution-Française and rue de l’Anguille lead into the teeming, dilapidated Maghrebian and Romany quarter, where women congregate on the secluded inner lanes but are seldom seen on the busier thoroughfares. Here you’ll find North African shops and cafés, especially on rue Llucia, and a daily market on place Cassanyes. Uphill and north from this stands the elegant church of St-Jacques (Tues–5pm 11am–5pm; free), which was built in two phases in the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries; it abuts La Miranda gardens, atop a section of the old city walls.
Palais des Rois de Majorque
Rue Archers • Daily: June–Sept 10am–6pm; Oct–May 9am–5pm • €4 •  04 68 34 96 26
A twenty-minute walk southwest through place des Esplanades brings you to the main entrance of the Palais des Rois de Majorque, which crowns the hill that dominates the southern part of the old town. Although Vauban’s walls surround it now, and it’s suffered generally from on-going military use until 1946, the two-storey palace and its partly arcaded courtyard date originally from the late thirteenth century. There are frequent worthwhile temporary exhibits in the former king’s apartments.
Musée Hyacinthe Rigaud
16 rue de l’Ange, near place Arago • Tues–Sun 10.30am–6pm • €5 •  04 68 35 43 40
The collection at the Musée Hyacinthe Rigaud is devoted largely to Catalan painters, most notably Minorcan-born Pierre Daura (1896–1976), a Republican and godson of Pablo Casals long exiled in the US: his sympathies are evident in two symbolic canvases of the post-Civil-War Republican refugee camps at nearby Argelès. One room has a few Maillol sketches and statues, and three portraits by Picasso. Expect some disruption as the museum has just been awarded €10 million to expand to become a major “cultural destination” sometime in 2017.
Forteresse de Salses
Guided tours: April–Sept 10am–6.30pm; Oct–March 10am–12.15pm & 2–5pm • €7.50 •  salses.monuments-nationaux.fr • Trains to Salses depart from Perpignan every 30min (13min)
An interesting stop 15km north of Perpignan is the Forteresse de Salses, in the town of Salses-le-Château. This late fifteenth-century Spanish-built fort, on the north end of town, was one of the first to be designed with a ground-hugging profile to protect it from artillery fire. It housed around one thousand troops and was entirely self-sufficient with wells, irrigation systems and even a bakery within the walls. Tours are in French but afterwards you will be able to explore some parts on your own.
Tautavel
Tautavel, 25km northwest of Perpignan off the St-Paul-de-Fenouillet road, might not have much to see, but is interesting anthropologically. In 1971 the remains of the oldest known European hominid – dated to around 450,000 years old – were discovered in the nearby Caune d’Arago cave, and a reconstruction of the skull and other cave finds are displayed in the village’s Musée de la Préhistoire (daily: 10am–12.30pm & 2–6pm; July–Aug 10am–7pm; €8;  450000ans.com).

ACCOMMODATION
D’Aragon 17 av Gilbert Brutus  04 68 54 04 46,  aragon-hotel.com. A bit out of the way, but handy for the Palais des Rois de Majorque, Aragon is a two-star with simple, unfussy rooms and parking nearby. €58
De la Loge 1 Fabriques d’en Nabot  04 68 34 41 02,  hoteldelaloge.fr. Smack in the centre of town, this is a tastefully renovated medieval mansion with a central courtyard, on a quiet alley. Try to get a room facing the courtyard if you want a peaceful sleep. Breakfast €5. €70
 New Christina 51 Cours Lassus  04 68 35 12 21,  hotel-newchristina.com. Sited a 5min stroll northeast of the old town centre and overlooking a large wooded park. The en-suite rooms within are comfortable if a little charmless, made up for by the irresistible fifth-floor plunge pool and sun terrace with views to the park. Disabled access. Closes Dec 20 for one month. €93
EATING, DRINKING AND ENTERTAINMENT
For a city of Perpignan’s size, restaurants, bars and clubs are quite thin on the ground. However, there’s the Trobades festival celebrating the medieval heritage of the region (in late September) and other events like the October-long Jazzèbre festival. But Perpignan’s best-known spectacle is La Procession de la Sanch, the Good Friday procession of red-hooded penitents that goes from the church of St-Jacques to the cathedral between 3pm and 5pm. Nightlife is largely confined to wine/tapas bars in the narrow alleyways of the old centre while young clubbers journey to the modern coastal resort of Canet Plage at weekends.
Bio Deux Anges 39 rue des Augustins  04 68 08 78 32,  biodeuxanges.com. Organic, vegetarian restaurant with nutritionally balanced menus from €15.50 based around whole grains such as quinoa and Camargue rice. Tues–Sat 9am–7pm.
 Boulangerie Chez Ben Bouzid Place Cassanyes  04 68 67 09 58. Savour the scent of a true boulangerie as you enter this gourmet tribute to France’s colonial past. Serves a selection of French and North African breads plus irresistibly sticky pastries for little more than €1. Daily 8am–5pm.
Café La Dolce Vita Place de la Révolution-Française   04 68 62 83 27. A delightful café on the edge of the St Jacques quarter with shaded tables next to an old marble well. Daily noon till around 6pm; closes later at weekends according to demand.
Café Vienne 3 place Arago  04 68 34 80 00. Specializing in seafood, this large nonstop pavement restaurant churns out three courses for €18 rising to €25 in the evening. The €25 “Oyster Seller’s Tray”, with all manner of tasty crustaceans is the highlight. Fri–Sat noon–midnight; Sun–Thurs noon–11pm.
Casa Sansa 2 rue Fabriques-Couvertes  04 68 50 48 01. In a smart side street, this place, with its bullfight posters and old photos on the wall, serves traditional regional dishes such as suquet-bouillabaisse, a Catalan take on the famous Marseillan fish broth. Menus start at around €17. Daily noon–2pm & 7–10.30pm.
New Bodega 3bis rue Voltaire  04 68 35 21 87,  lanew-bodega.e-monsite.com. A tapas restaurant rather than bar, with severely limited seating – booking is advisable at weekends. It’s straightforward classic tapas: patatas bravas, gambas planxa calamari and the like, with prices mostly hovering around the €5 mark, and all joyfully prepared behind the large glass screen next to the tables. Daily noon–2pm & 7–11pm.
 Le P’Ti Resto 6 rue Sainte-Magdeleine  09 54 38 53 58. A restaurant for more adventurous carnivores, this is the place to try tartare. Every dish is vibrant, with accompaniments chosen as much for their colour as their contrasting tastes: try the lobster tartare served with a roast onion and broad bean salad and lobster jus. Menus from €16. Noon–2pm & 7–11pm except all Sun and Mon lunch.
 La Table 5 rue de la Poissonnerie  09 53 17 03 01. Perpignan’s gourmet choice delivers beautifully presented plates (and slates) in atmospheric surroundings.

Mon 7–10pm, Tues & Wed noon–2pm & 7–10pm, Thurs noon–2pm & 7–10.30pm, Fri & Sat noon–2pm & 7–11.30pm.
Castlenou
Twenty kilometres southwest of Perpignan, beyond the winemaking town of Thuir, is CASTELNOU, one of the best-preserved villages in the Pyrenees. Surrounded by rolling hills of sun-baked scrub and oak, there’s little sign of modernization for miles around, save for the road to the village. Through the pedestrianized fourteenth-century portal, the village rambles up towards the pentagon-shaped Château de Castelnou (Oct–April Sat–Wed 11am–5pm; May–Sept daily 10am–7pm; €5.50;  04 68 53 22 91,  chateaudecastelnou.fr) – a worthwhile ascent for the views alone. First inhabited in 990 AD, the château served as the military and administrative capital to the Viscount of Vallespir until 1321. Despite its elevated position, it was besieged several times, notably by the kings of Majorca and Aragón in 1285 and 1295. There’s a car park at the base of the village or up the hill behind the castle.
ACCOMMODATION AND EATING: CASTELNOU
 Chambre d’hôte/Crêperie la Figuera 3 Carrer de la Fond D’Avall   04 68 53 18 42,  la-figuera.com. In a truly idyllic spot at the base of the village with a gorgeous terrace cloaked with plants and flowers, and tables beneath rambling fig trees. The restaurant produces simple Catalan dishes and galettes from €8 or you can just stop by for a quick drink (Easter–Sept noon–2pm & 7–9pm; nonstop service at busier times). €75

The Côte Vermeille
The Côte Vermeille, where the Pyrenees meet the sea, is the last patch of French shoreline before Spain, its seaside villages once so remote that the Fauvist painters of the early 1900s hid out here. Mass tourism may have ended any sense of exclusivity but outside of high season there is solitude and peace among the wide empty beaches; interspersed between modern resorts like Port-Barcarès (north east of Perpignan), Canet Plage and Argèles-sur-Mer. The coastline remains sandy and straight almost until the border before being pushed east by the upsurging Pyrenean chain, where the prettier cove towns of Collioure and Banyuls are found.
Collioure
Some thirty kilometres southeast of Perpignan, COLLIOURE is achingly picturesque. Palm trees line the curving main beach of Port d’Avall, while slopes of vines and olives rise to ridges crowned with ruined forts and watchtowers. Its setting and monuments inspired Henri Matisse and André Derain to embark in 1905 on their explosive Fauvist colour experiments.
  Collioure is dominated by its twelfth-century Château-Royal (daily: 9am–5pm; July & Aug 10am–7pm; €4;  04 68 82 06 43), founded by the Templars and subject to later alterations by the kings of Mallorca and Aragón, and again after the Treaty of the Pyrenees gave Collioure to France. The mediocre permanent “collection” inside scarcely merits the entrance fee; attend instead a concert in the courtyard.
  The second landmark in the town is the Église Notre-Dame-des-Anges (daily: 9am–noon & 2–6pm; free;   04 68 82 06 43), which features in every postcard and tourist brochure of the region. With its belfry dating back to the middle ages, this building served as a beacon for the port until the late seventeenth century when the rest of the church was adjoined. Behind it two small beaches are divided by a causeway leading to the chapel of St-Vincent, built on a former islet, while west from here a concrete path follows the rocky shore to the bay of Le Racou.
  Just north of the château lies the old harbour, still home to a handful of brightly painted lateen-rigged fishing boats – now more likely used as pleasure craft – all that remains of Collioure’s traditional fleet. Beyond this, the stone houses and sloping lanes of the old Mouré quarter are the main focus of interest.
INFORMATION: COLLIOURE
Tourist office Place de 18-Juin (April–June & Sept 9am–noon & 2–7pm; July & Aug Mon–Sat 9am–8pm & Sun 10am–6pm; Oct–March Mon–Sat 9am–noon & 2–6pm;  04 68 82 15 47,  collioure.com).
ACCOMMODATION
 L’Arapede Rte de Port-Vendres  04 68 98 09 59,  arapede.com. This spacious, modern hotel fifteen minutes’ walk away from the centre of the town has ample parking (drivers should note that Collioure can be a parking nightmare) and a beautiful clifftop garden patio with pool. There’s also a mini beach five minutes away. Half-board is available for an extra €32pp. Closed mid-Nov to mid-Feb. €90
Caranques Rte de Port-Vendres  04 68 82 06 68,  les-caranques.com. With the best view in town, this clifftop hotel looks down to the sea and Collioure. There’s a private staircase down the cliffside to an area suitable for swimming. The rooms are slightly basic for the level of the hotel but the balcony outlook compensates. Breakfast €13. Closed Nov–March. €150
La Girelle Plage d’Ouille  04 68 81 25 56,  campinglagirelle.unblog.fr. Enviably positioned next to a nice little sandy beach, this mostly tent-only site, ten minutes’ walk from Collioure, offers a decent range of services including a snack-bar restaurant, grocery and fridge lockers. Three bed caravans can be rented by the week for €399 if you book well in advance. April–Sept. €30.50
Hostellerie des Templiers 12 av Camille-Pelletan  04 68 98 31 10,  hotel-templiers.com. The most central place to stay, this atmospheric hotel celebrates Collioure’s art heritage (Picasso frequented the bar downstairs) with paintings screening the bar and corridor walls. The hotel itself rambles into an annex that backs on to an occasionally noisy nightclub. Closed mid-Nov to Jan. €70
EATING
Le 5eme Péché 18 rue Fraternité  04 68 98 09 76,  le-cinquieme-peche.com. Collioure’s most innovative restaurant, and perhaps the only place in France creating Japanese-French fusion. Expect colourful platters combining the uncommon bedfellows of fruit and fish to the delight of any adventurous palate. Two-course menus cost €19. 12.15–1.45pm & 7.30–9pm; closed Sun & Wed eve plus all Mon.
Paco 18 rue Rière  04 68 82 90 91. There are a few tapas options in town but this is easily the best. Open year-round, there’s a convivial atmosphere that spills onto the narrow lane as locals and tourists effortlessly mingle with one another over generous platters of calamari, razor clams and cured hams. Tapas range from €3.50 to €7.50. 11am–3pm & 5.30pm–12.30am; closed Tues.
Banyuls-sur-Mer
South towards BANYULS-SUR-MER, 10km from Collioure, both the main highway and minor D914 wind through attractive vineyards, with the Albères hills rising steeply on the right. Make sure you sample the dark, full-bodied Banyuls dessert wine, an appellation that applies only to the vineyards of the Côte Vermeille. The town itself, facing a broad sweep of pebble beach, is pleasant but lacks the overt charm of Collioure.
  On the seafront avenue du Fontaulé, the Biodiversarium (April–June & Sept Wed–Sun 2–6pm; July–Aug 9.30am–12.30pm & 2–6pm; €5;  04 68 88 73 39,   biodiversarium.fr) aquarium, run by Sorbonne university’s marine biology department, has tanks containing a comprehensive collection of the region’s submarine life; this is protected in a nearby réserve marine, France’s best, which can be explored with local scuba outfitters.
  Four kilometres southwest of town in the Vallée de Roume, signposted from the top of avenue de Gaulle, is the Musée Maillol (temporarily closed for renovation;  04 68 88 57 11,  museemaillol.com), which is devoted to the works of sculptor Aristide Maillol (1861–1944), who was born near Banyuls. He is buried under his statue La Pensée in Banyuls.
INFORMATION: BANYULS-SUR-MER
Tourist office Diagonally opposite the mairie on the seafront (July & Aug 9am–7pm; Sept–June Mon–Sat 9am–noon & 2–6pm;  04 68 88 31 58,  banyuls-sur-mer.com).
ACCOMMODATION & EATING
Les Elmes At the eponymous sandy cove 1.5km north of town  04 58 88 03 12,  hotel-des-elmes.com or   restaurant-la-littorine.fr. Slap bang on the beachfront, this hotel has excellent facilities including a hot tub, sauna, terrace and an in-house restaurant (La Littorine) downstairs. The rooms are comfortable and well equipped but aim for the sea-view ones instead of the road outlook if you can afford extra. If you dine here, it may be a bit pricey, but you’re in for a treat; €32 buys you the three perfectly balanced, elegant-looking dishes from the gourmet menu. €88
Le Fanal Av de Fontaulé  04 68 98 65 88,  pascal-borrell.com. Classic French cuisine served alfresco on tables overlooking the marina. The service can be a little slow but it’s well worth the wait. The two course €19 menu might include a very fresh catch of the day and a mouthwatering chocolate millefeuille. Daily noon–2pm & 7–10pm; closed Sun, Mon & Wed eve.
Les Pieds dans l’Eau Rue des Elmes  06 27 34 81 66,  locations-vacances-banyuls.ch. A self-catering apartment complex ideal for couples and families. Right on the sandy beach and just far enough away from the main road, it’s an extremely relaxing spot. In high season there is a minimum stay period of one week. €500 per week
Vallée de Tech
The D115 winds its way through the beautiful Vallée de Tech starting at the border town, Le Boulou, then westwards through pretty little Céret, capital of the Vallespir region. Further upstream, the road passes through the dilapidated spa town, Amélie-les-Bains, and scruffy Arles-sur-Tech, whose only attraction is the sumptuous Abbaye de Ste-Marie. Just past Arles, the narrow Gorges de la Fou is well worth an outing, before you continue west to the captivating medieval walled town of Prats-de-Mollo, which is guarded by a menacing Vauban fortification.
GETTING AROUND: VALLÉE DE TECH
By bus Destinations to and from Perpignan along the Tech valley include Amélie-les-Bains (10 daily; 55min); Arles-sur-Tech (10 daily; 1hr); Céret (15 daily; 40min); and Prats-de-Mollo (2–3 daily; 1hr 40min).
Céret
Céret is a delightful place, with a wonderfully shady old town overhung by huge plane trees; the central streets are narrow and winding, opening onto small squares like plaça de Nou Reigs (“Nine Spouts” in Catalan), named after its central fountain; on avenue d’Espagne, two remnants of the medieval walls, the Porte de France and Porte d’Espagne, are visible. The town’s main sight, however, is the remarkable Musée d’Art Moderne (July to mid Sept 10am–7pm; mid-Sept to June 10am–6pm; mid-Oct to April closed Tues; €8;  04 68 87 27 76,  musee-ceret.com) at 8 bd Maréchal Joffre. Between about 1910 and 1935, Céret’s charms – coupled with the residence here of the Catalan artist and sculptor Manolo – drew a number of avant-garde artists to the town, including Matisse and Picasso, who personally dedicated a number of pictures to the museum. The holdings are too extensive to mount everything at once, but there are works on show by Chagall, Miró, Pignon, Picasso and Dufy, among others.
INFORMATION: CÉRET
Tourist office 1 av Clemenceau (June–Aug Mon–Sat 9am–1pm & 1.30–7pm, Sun 9am–1pm; Sept–May Mon–Sat 9am–12.30pm & 2–5pm;   04 68 87 00 53,  ceret.fr).
ACCOMMODATION & EATING
Restaurant La Fontaine Plaça de Nou Reigs  04 68 87 23 47. Few could resist dining in this beautiful, traffic-free marbled square shaded by vast plane trees. If you have a family, this is the perfect place for a relaxing meal while the kids dip hands in and out of the marbled fountain. The plat du jour costs €10. Noon–2.30pm & 7–10pm; closed Tues.
 Vidal 4 place Soutine  04 68 87 00 85,  hotelceret.com. A tastefully converted eighteenth-century episcopal palace within the old town walls, Vidal is now a charming and unpretentious hotel that has a decent restaurant, Del Bisbe, attached. Its first-floor terraced restaurant, shaded by vines, serves tasty, if not ground-breaking, regional dishes including lamb roasted with pistachios. The three-course menu costs €28. Noon–2pm & 7.30–9.30pm; closed Tues & Wed. Hotel and restaurant closed Nov. €50
Abbaye de Ste-Marie
Arles-sur-Tech • July & Aug 9am–7pm; Sept–June Mon–Sat 9am–noon & 2–6pm; also Sun April–Oct 2–5pm • €4 •  04 68 83 90 66
The Romanesque Abbaye de Ste-Marie, in Arles-sur-Tech, 14km from Céret, has Carolingian origins, thought to account for the back-to-front alignment of the altar at the west end and entrance at the east. Entry is via the pleasant thirteenth-century cloister. The unique and compelling feature of the massive church interior is a band of still vividly coloured twelfth-century frescoes high up in the apse of the eastern anti-chapel dedicated to St-Michel and which, appropriately, feature the archangel.
Gorges de la Fou
April–Nov daily 10am–6pm • €9.50 •  04 68 39 16 21
The world’s narrowest canyon, the Gorges de la Fou, spans a spectacular 2km cut through the southeastern flank of Pic du Canigou; at some parts the walls are only one metre apart. Aided by a metal catwalk, the ascent through the gorge is not overly arduous.
Prats-de-Mollo
Beyond the Gorges de la Fou, the D115 climbs steadily, between valley sides thick with walnut, oak and sweet chestnut, 19km to PRATS-DE-MOLLO, the end of the bus line. Prats is the last French town before the Spanish frontier, 13km beyond at Col d’Ares, but it has none of the usual malaise of border towns and is the most attractive place in the valley since Céret. Hub of the newer quarter is El Firal, the huge square used for markets since 1308 (it takes place on Fridays); the walled and gated ville haute just south makes for a wonderful wander, with its steep cobbled streets and a weathered church that has marvellous ironwork on the door. The old town’s walls were rebuilt in the seventeenth century after the suppression of a local revolt against onerous taxation imposed by Louis XIV on his new, post-Treaty Pyrenees holdings.
  Vauban’s fortress, the Fort Lagarde (guided visits: April–June & Sept–Oct Tues–Sun 2–6pm; July & Aug daily 10.30am–1pm, 3.30pm & 5–6.30pm; €3.50;  04 68 39 70 83; enquire about guided tours at the tourist office) sits on the heights above the town. It was built in 1677 as much to intimidate the local population as to keep the Spanish out.
INFORMATION: PRATS-DE-MOLLO
Tourist office Place le Fioral (April–Oct 9am–6pm; Nov–March Mon–Fri 10am–5pm;  04 68 39 70 83,  pratsdemollolapreste.com).
ACCOMMODATION AND EATING
Le Bellevue Rue el Firal  04 68 39 72 48,  hotel-le-bellevue.fr. Overlooking the place/Friday market, just outside the town wall, this appealing hotel offers private parking and rooms with balconies for a little extra. Its restaurant has seasonal menus from €20. Closed Dec to mid-Feb. €56
Hostellerie Le Relais 3 place Josep de la Trinxeria   04 68 39 71 30,  hotelrestaurantlerelais.com. Cheerful pastel-hued rooms and a south-facing garden restaurant serving an exciting range to suit all budgets including paella and Catalan meatballs, with two-course menus starting from €11. €51
Village Liberté Rte Col d’Arès, 100m south of the old town  04 68 39 72 78,  vvf-villages.com. A small family holiday village with petite studios, two-room apartments and leisure facilities including a nice pool. Advance booking essential. Easter–Oct. €100
Saint Marsal and around
The only direct route between the valleys of the Tech and the Têt, best covered by car or cycle, is the D618 from Amélie-les-Bains to Bouleternère. It’s 44 slow kilometres of mountain road, twisting through hillside meadows and magnificent oak forests, past isolated masies (Catalan farmsteads). Halfway there is the tiny village of Saint Marsal, which offers the first amenities en route and is well worth the stop.
Prieuré de Serrabona
Daily except major holidays 10am–6pm • €4 •  04 68 84 09 30
On the D84 just past Boule d’Amont, you’ll come across one of the finest examples – arguably the finest – of Roussillon Romanesque. The interior of the Prieuré de Serrabona (consecrated 1151) is starkly plain, making the beautifully carved column capitals of its rib-vaulted tribune even more striking: lions, centaurs, griffins and human figures with Asiatic faces and hairstyles – motifs brought back from the Crusades – executed in pink marble from Villefranche-de-Conflent, by students of the Maître d’Cabestany, if not himself.
The Têt valley
The upper Têt valley, known as the Pays de Conflent, is utterly dominated by the Pic du Canigou. The valley bottoms are lush with fields and orchards, but the vast and uncompromising mountain presides over all. As you continue upstream, the valley steepens and buckles as magnificent gorges carve in from the surrounding mountains and scalding water bleeds from the valley’s northern flank. Ancient shepherd villages, basking in Mediterranean glow, peer down on the road below. Crisscrossing the Têt, the vintage Train Jaune groans its way towards the Cerdagne plateau.
Prades (Prada) and around
The chief valley town is Prades, easily accessible by train and bus on the Perpignan–Villefranche–Latour-de-Carol route, and one obvious starting point for all excursions in the Canigou region. Although there are no great sights beyond the church of St-Pierre (free entry) in central place de la République, the town enjoys a status disproportionate to its size. This is largely thanks to Catalan cellist Pablo (Pau) Casals, who was a fierce opponent of the Franco regime in Spain, and consequently settled here as an exile. In 1950 he instituted the internationally renowned chamber music festival ( prades-festival-casals.com), held annually from late July to mid-August, the usual venue being the abbey of St-Michel-de-Cuixà.
  The thriving Tuesday morning market is not to be missed, with its produce strongly influenced by Catalan and north African culture; you’ll find paella, churros and fresh Moroccan spices, traded to the sounds of accordion buskers and congregations of elderly men chatting in French-Catalan dialect.
Abbaye St-Michel-de-Cuxà
May–Sept daily 9.30–11.50am & 2–6pm; Oct–April Mon–Sat 9.30–11.50am & 2–5pm • €5 •  04 68 96 15 35,  abbaye-cuxa.com
Three kilometres south of Prades stands one of the loveliest abbeys in France, the eleventh-century St-Michel-de-Cuxà. Although mutilated after the Revolution it is still beautiful, with its crenelated tower silhouetted against the wooded – sometimes snowy – slopes of Canigou. You enter via the labyrinthine, vaulted crypt, with its round central chamber, before proceeding to the church with its strange Visigothic-style “keyhole” arches. But the glory of the place is the cloister and its twelfth-century column capitals.
ARRIVAL AND INFORMATION: PRADES AND AROUND
By bus The bus depot is on av du Général-de-Gaulle on the east side of town.

Tourist office 10 place de la République (mid-Sept to mid-June Mon–Sat 9am–noon & 2–6pm; mid-June to mid-Sept 9am–6pm;   04 68 05 41 02,  prades-tourisme.fr).
ACCOMMODATION
 Castell Rose Chemin de la Litera  04 68 96 07 57,  castellrose-prades.com. Sumptuous chambres d’hôtes in a converted manor house with a pool and tennis court. Although just a short walk from the centre of Prades, it’s a very peaceful and secluded spot, thanks to the extensive grounds and the glorious views south to the Massif du Canigou. This outlook is also enjoyed from the homely bedrooms, particularly the ones with private balconies. €99
Chambre d’hôte Maison Prades 51 av du Général-de-Gaulle  04 68 05 74 27,  maisonprades.com. With its big bright rooms looking up to the Pic du Canigou and down to the sunny garden, this chambre d’hôte looks after its guests well. Breakfasts (included) are copious, delicious and healthy. €70
Le Grand Hôtel Molitg-les-Bains, 6km north of Prades  04 68 05 00 50,  grandhotelmolitg.com. If money is no object and you have transport, then this old and charmingly dishevelled spa hotel, beautifully set in a secluded valley next to a river, is a fine choice. Bathe in the hotel’s thermal waters, or more appealingly, the gentle flowing river below. The hotel’s gourmet restaurant has high standards and fairly high prices; a two-course meal costs €27. €115
L’Oasis Molitg-les-Bains, 6km north of Prades  04 68 05 00 92,  l-oasis-molitg-les-bains.fr. More down-to-earth than Le Grand Hôtel across the road, this budget option offers exceptional value with its basic, but clean rooms. €46
EATING
A number of appealing pavement café-restaurants ring the central place and while they offer a pleasant place to stop for a kir or two the food tends to be of poor quality.
 Restaurant Le Galie 3 av du Général-de-Gaulle  04 68 05 53 76,  gvillago.ovhsitebuilder.com. With its bold, flavourful and typically colourful Catalan-inspired dishes, you’ll forgive this small restaurant’s rather sombre atmosphere. For a light lunch, try the exquisite goat’s cheese and fig millefeuille or the prawn tempura, leaving room for their home-made éclair Paris. Menus start at €18 for two courses. Noon–3pm & 7.30–9.30pm; closed Tues eve plus all Mon & Wed.
Eus
The village of Eus, a five-minute drive northeast of Prades, claims to be the sunniest in France; it’s certainly one of the prettiest. Built among massive granite boulders that litter these elevated slopes, narrow cobbled lanes wind up to the ruined château and imposing eighteenth-century church of St Vincent. A number of easy hikes begin from the entrance to the village through the olive groves and gnarled green oak forests.
DRINKING
Des Gouts et des Couleurs Place de la Républic  06 09 53 32 47. No visit to Eus would be complete without visiting this convivial pavement bar occupying its own little place. Opening hours approximately mid-March to mid-Nov daily 11am–7pm.
Villefranche-de-Conflent
Some six kilometres up the Têt from Prades, the medieval garrison town of Villefranche-de-Conflent is dwarfed by sheer limestone escarpments, and is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful in France. Founded in 1092 by the counts of Cerdagne to block incursions from rivals in Roussillon, then remodelled by Vauban in the seventeenth century after annexation by France, its streets and fortifications have remained untouched by subsequent events. Worth a visit is St-Jacques church, with its primitively carved thirteenth-century baptismal font just inside the door; you can also walk the walls for €6 when the tourist office is open.
PETIT TRAIN JAUNE
One of the most spectacular train rides in the world, the Petit Train Jaune runs between Villefranche-de-Conflent and La Tour-de-Carol (with onward links towards Toulouse or Barcelona) in the upper Cerdagne, and is a wonder of early twentieth-century engineering. Built to link up the villages of the high Pyrenees with Perpignan, the antique narrow-gauge carriages now mostly carry tourists, cyclists and skiers. The most spectacular section of the route is in the upper Têt between Olette and Mont-Louis, where you’ll trundle over gorges and massive viaducts. The summertime frequency of the trains makes it practical to hop off and on, allowing you to explore the areas around smaller, isolated stations, many of them haltes facultatifs (ask to be set down). Outside summer, the timetable is somewhat unreliable, as the ageing train system needs regular maintenance.
Château-Fort Libéria
Daily: 10am–6pm; May & June 10am–7pm; July–Aug 9am–8pm • €10 or €7 if you fancy walking up •  fort-liberia.com
In 1681, Vauban constructed the Château-Fort Libéria on the heights above Villefranche-de-Conflent to protect it from “aerial” bombardment. Getting there involves taking the jeep, which leaves from near the town’s main gate; you can return to Villefranche by descending a subterranean stairway of a thousand steps, emerging at the end of rue St-Pierre.
St-Martin-du-Canigou
A 30min walk (no car access) above the hamlet of Casteil, itself eight kilometres south of Villefranche in the Vallée de Cady. French guided tours: Mon–Sat 10am, 11am, 2pm, 3pm, 4pm; plus June–Sept noon & 5pm; Sun/hols 10am & 12.30pm; closed Jan & Mon Oct–May • €6 •  stmartinducanigou.org
The stunning abbey of St-Martin-du-Canigou, founded in 1001, resurrected from ruins between 1902 and 1982, and now inhabited by a working religious community, occupies a narrow promontory of rock surrounded by chestnut and oak woods, while above it rises the precipitous slopes of the Pic du Canigou. Below, the ground drops vertically into the ravine of the Cady stream rushing down from the Col de Jou. What you see is a beautiful little garden and cloister overlooking the ravine, a low-ceiling, atmospheric chapel beneath the church, and the main church itself.
INFORMATION: VILLEFRANCHE-DE-CONFLENT
Tourist office 2 rue St Jean, by the western gate (Feb, Oct & Nov 10.30am–noon & 2–5pm; March–May 10.30am–5pm; June & Sept 10am–7pm; July & Aug 10am–8pm; Dec 2–5pm; closed Jan;  04 68 96 22 96,  villefranchedeconflent-tourisme.fr).
ACCOMMODATION
À l’Ombre du Fort 2 Sainte-Eulalie  04 68 97 10 01,  activityholidayfrance.com. A grand nineteenth-century house cloaked in Virginia creeper with spacious rooms and parquet flooring. Outside there’s a large, landscaped garden and sun-drenched swimming pool secluded by trees. Min stay 2 nights. Breakfast included. €85
Camping Les Cerisiers Chemin de la Pena, Vernet-les-Bains (6km south of Villefranche)  04 68 05 60 38,  camping-lescerisiers.com. Unlike other campsites in the area, this pleasant little site is peacefully tucked away from any kind of main road. It’s also well located for attempts to summit the Pic du Canigou. There are a few facilities here: sauna, hot tub, free wi-fi and little shop, while Vernet covers all other needs. Mid-March to mid-Oct. €20
EATING
 Boulangerie Patisserie Miras 13 rue Saint Jacques  04 68 96 37 06,  boulangerie.miras.free.fr. Run by a genuine artisan boulanger, this is the ideal place to sample the Bunyete, a Catalan speciality akin to a pancake-doughnut-cross (€2.50). This attractive little shop proudly bakes its breads and pastries in a 1930s cast iron, wood-fired oven. Tues–Sun 7am–1pm & 2–7pm; July & Aug daily 6.30am–8.30pm.
La Senyera 81 rue Saint Jean  04 68 96 17 65,  lasenyera.fr. This beautiful and atmospheric restaurant has the best reputation in town and is where the locals choose to dine. Dishes like the millefeuille de thon display a refreshingly sophisticated flair for a touristic hub like Villefranche, although there are a few gimmicks such as slates acting as plates. Budget around €20–30 for a generous meal. Noon–2pm & 7.30–9pm; Nov–March closed Wed lunch & eves except Sat eve; April–Oct closed Tues–Thurs eve; closed mid-Oct to mid-Nov & first week of July.
The upper Têt
Ten or so kilometres west of Villefranche, the mountains close in, dwarfing the valley and road below. As you turn right just past the village of Olette the road leads to the picture-perfect shepherd’s village of Evol, overlooked by the old fortress of the So Viscounts. Further up the Têt, most of the settlements are high on the mountainside, connected by ancient footpaths and dry-stone terraces, the most breathtaking of which is Canaveilles; from the main road it’s three kilometres of vertiginous single-track hairpins to reach this characterful old village. If you cross the main N166 road from the foot of Canaveilles and follow the well-trodden path to the river, you’ll see a stone basin with scalding thermal water pouring in from the mountainside with a makeshift sluice gate in the river for temperature adjustment. Some 3km further on the south side of the valley, the wild, wooded Gorges de la Carança (Thuès-Entre-Valls is the nearest village) cuts south through the mountains towards Spain.
  One trip worth making, particularly after a heavy day’s trekking, is to Les Bains de St-Thomas (daily 10am–7.40pm; July & Aug last admission 8.40pm; closed early June & Nov; €6.50;  04 68 97 03 13,  bains-saint-thomas.fr). Signposted from Fontpedrouse, 11km west of Olette, there are three open-air thermal pools here set at a pleasant 36–38°C, and located in a beautiful pine forest.
ACCOMMODATION AND EATING: UPPER TET VALLEY
There is a real dearth of accommodation options in this well-touristed area, except for holiday homes that usually rent by the week. Crucially there are no restaurants here either; the nearest are either back in Villefranche or up in Mont Louis.
La Fontaine In the centre of Olette  04 68 97 03 67,  atasteofcatalonia.co.uk. An excellent, English-run chambre d’hôte with five very tasteful rooms including a family suite. Breakfast is provided here but for all other meals in this town there is only a café across the road selling sandwiches. Closed Jan. €58
The Cerdagne
Twenty kilometres up from Olette, the Mediterranean climate slips away as the gradient flattens onto the wide, grassy Cerdagne plateau, whose once-powerful counts controlled lands from Barcelona to Roussillon. It’s a region that’s never been sure whether it is Spanish or French. After the French annexation of Roussillon, it was partitioned, with Spain retaining – as it still does – the enclave of Lliva. The Petit Train Jaune snakes laboriously across the entire plateau, though stations aren’t always convenient for the settlements they nominally serve.
Mont Louis
Easterly gateway to the region, the little garrison town of Mont Louis, built by Vauban in 1679–82, is France’s highest fortified town. The top citadelle is still a training school for paratroops and marines. Today the town is an attractive halfway station between the Mediterranean and Andorra, and has a few shops, bars and restaurants.
ACCOMMODATION AND EATING: MONT LOUIS
Chambre d’hôte La Volute 1 place d’Armes  06 21 58 01 80,  lavolute.wix.com/lavolute. Set in the seventeenth-century former governor’s mansion, with a garden atop a section of the ramparts overlooking the moat and mountains beyond. Minimum stay of one week outside of low season €110
Le Rucher de l’Ours 6 bd Vauban  04 68 04 11 26,  miel-lerucherdelours.fr. Welcoming little crêperie serving three courses for €16 under a stone-vaulted roof or outside in the often chilly wind. The restaurant is owned by a fantastic honey producer so be sure to stock up from the vast array of bee-related produce also sold here. Wed–Sun noon–2.30pm & 7–9pm; daily, with extended opening hours during school holidays.
Les Lacs des Bouillouses
The Têt ultimately has its source in the Carlit massif, which looms above the lovely Lacs des Bouillouses. This huge park in the high Pyrenees is strikingly beautiful; the sky is a different, purer kind of blue and the river and lake waters are clear and fresh. There are moderately difficult, circular hikes around the lakes that feed into the main reservoir as well as idyllic picnic beaches along the banks of the gentle river. Wild swimming in the summer months is a more than appealing prospect. To get here, turn north from Mont Louis and from there it’s well signposted.

Abbey de Fontfroide
Fontfroide, 15km southwest of Narbonne • Guided tours daily: April–June & Sept 10am–12.15pm & 1.45pm–5.30pm; July & Aug 10am–6pm; Oct 10am–12.15pm & 1.45–4.45pm; Nov–March 10am–noon & 2–4pm • €10.80 •  04 68 45 11 08,  fontfroide.com
A good side trip from Narbonne – just 15km southwest, but impossible without transport of your own – is the lovely Abbey de Fontfroide, which enjoys a beautiful location tucked into a fold in the dry cypress-clad hillsides. The extant buildings go back to the twelfth century, with some elegant seventeenth-century additions in the entrance and courtyards, and were in use from their foundation until 1900, first by Benedictines, then Cistercians. It was one of the Cistercian monks, Pierre de Castelnau, whose murder as papal legate sparked the notorious Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in 1208.
  Visits to the restored abbey are only possible on a guided tour. Star features include the cloister, with its marble pillars and giant wisteria creepers, the church itself, some fine ironwork and a rose garden. The stained glass in the windows of the lay brothers’ dormitory consists of fragments from churches in north and eastern France damaged in World War I.


Carcassonne
Right on the main Toulouse–Montpellier train link, CARCASSONNE couldn’t be easier to reach. For anyone travelling through this region it is a must – one of the most dramatic, if also most-visited, towns in the whole of Languedoc. Carcassonne owes its division into two separate “towns” to the wars against the Cathars. Following Simon de Montfort’s capture of the town in 1209, its people tried in 1240 to restore their traditional ruling family, the Trencavels. In reprisal, King Louis IX expelled them from the Cité, only permitting their return on the condition that they built on the low ground by the River Aude – what would become the ville basse.
  A major summertime event worth catching is the Festival de Carcassonne from late June to mid-August, featuring world-class dance, theatre and music. The high point is the mammoth fireworks display on Bastille Day (July 14).

THE CANAL DU MIDI
The Canal du Midi runs for 240km from the River Garonne at Toulouse via Carcassonne to the Mediterranean at Agde. It was the brainchild of Pierre-Paul Riquet, a minor noble and tax collector, who succeeded in convincing Louis XIV (and more importantly, his first minister, Colbert) of the merits of linking the Atlantic and the Mediterranean via the Garonne.
  The work, begun in 1667, took fourteen years to complete, using tens of thousands of workers. The crux of the problem from the engineering point of view was how to feed the canal with water when its high point at Naurouze, west of Carcassonne, was 190m above sea level and 58m above the Garonne at Toulouse. Riquet responded by building a system of reservoirs in the Montagne Noire, channelling run-off from the heights down to Naurouze. He spent the whole of his fortune on the canal and, sadly, died just six months before its inauguration in 1681.
  The canal was a success and sparked a wave of prosperity along its course, with traffic increasing steadily until 1857, when the Sète–Bordeaux railway was opened, reducing trade on the canal to all but nothing. Today, the canal remains a marvel of engineering and beauty, incorporating no fewer than 99 locks (écluses) and 130 bridges, almost all of which date back to the first era of construction. The canal has, since its construction, been known for the lovely plane trees that line riverbank. Sadly, a wilt infection was discovered in 2006 and since then the trees have been systematically cut down. They will be replaced, however the view will not be the same for many years to come. You can follow the canal by road, and many sections have foot or bicycle paths, but the best way to see it is, of course, by boat. Outfits in all the major ports rent houseboats and barges, and there are many cruise options to choose from as well. Other sources of information include  canalmidi.com and   french-waterways.com, plus the tourist offices in Carcassonne and Toulouse.
Boat rental and cruises Le Boat ( 1 800 734 5491,  leboat.com or Locaboat (  03 86 91 72 72,   locaboat.com), both have a number of branches in Languedoc and the Midi.
Information Voies Navigables de France, 2 Port St-Étienne in Toulouse ( 05 61 36 24 24,  sudouest.vnf.fr); they also have English-speaking offices at the major canal ports.
Cité
To reach the Cité from the ville basse, take bus #2 from outside the station, or a navette from Square Gambetta. Alternatively, walk it in less than 30min, crossing the Pont-Vieux and climbing rue Barbacane, past the church of St-Gimer to the sturdy bastion of the Porte d’Aude (this is effectively the back entrance – the main gate is Porte Narbonnaise, on the east side)
The attractions of the well-preserved and lively ville basse notwithstanding, everybody comes to Carcassonne to see the Cité, the double-walled and turreted fortress that crowns the hill above the River Aude. From a distance it’s the epitome of the fairy-tale medieval town. Viollet-le-Duc rescued it from ruin in 1844, and his “too-perfect” restoration has been furiously debated ever since. It is, as you would expect, a real tourist trap. Yet, in spite of the chintzy cafés, craft shops and the crowds, you’d have to be a very stiff-necked purist not to be moved at all.

Château Comtal
1 rue Viollet-le-Duc • Daily: April–Sept 9.30am–6.30pm; Oct–March 9.30am–5pm; guided tours only, several in English • €8.50 •  04 68 11 70 70,  carcassonne.monuments-nationaux.fr
There is no charge for admission to the streets or the grassy lices – “lists” – between the walls, though cars are banned from 10am to 6pm. However, to see the inner fortress of the Château Comtal and walk the walls, you’ll have to join a guided tour. These assume some knowledge of French history, and point out the various phases in the construction of the fortifications, from Roman and Visigothic to Romanesque and the post-Cathar adaptations of the French kings.
St-Nazaire
Place St-Nazaire • Mon–Fri 8.45am–12.45pm & 1.45–5/6pm, Sat & Sun 8.45–10.30am & 2–5/6pm • Free •   04 68 10 24 30 •  carcassonne.org
Don’t miss the beautiful church of St-Nazaire, towards the southern corner of the Cité at the end of rue St-Louis. It’s a serene combination of nave with carved capitals in the Romanesque style and a Gothic choir and transepts, along with some of the loveliest stained glass in Languedoc. In the south transept is a tombstone believed to belong to Simon de Montfort. You can also climb the tower for spectacular views over the Cité.
ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE: CARCASSONNE
By plane Carcassonne airport lies just west of the city ( 04 68 71 96 46,  aeroport-carcassonne.com). A navette (€5; hourly; 15min) leaves from outside the terminal and stops at the gare SNCF, square Gambetta and the Cité; a taxi to the centre will cost €8–15.
By train The gare SNCF is in the ville basse on the north bank of the Canal du Midi at the northern limits of the old town.
Destinations Arles (4–8 daily; 2hr 40min–3hr 30min); Béziers (22 daily; 45min–1hr 45min); Bordeaux (18–22 daily; 3hr 20min–4hr 30min); Limoux (16 daily; 25min); Marseille (12–18 daily; 3hr 20min–5hr 30min); Montpellier (18 daily; 1hr 30min–4hr); Narbonne (22 daily; 35min); Nîmes (26 daily; 2hr 5min–3hr 10min); Quillan (6 daily; 1hr 15min); Toulouse (22 daily; 45min–1hr).

Châteaux de Lastours
16km north of Carcassonne • Feb, March, Nov & Dec Sat, Sun & hols 10am–5pm; April–June & Sept daily 10am–6pm; July & Aug daily 9am–8pm; Oct daily 10am–5pm • €6 •  04 68 77 56 02,  les4chateaux-lastours.lwdsoftware.net
The most memorable site in the Montaigne Noire is the Châteaux de Lastours, the most northerly of the Cathar castles. There are, in fact, four castles here – their ruined keeps jutting superbly from a sharp ridge of scrub and cypress that plunges to rivers on both sides. The two oldest, Cabaret (mid-eleventh century) and Surdespine (1153), fell into de Montfort’s hands in 1211, after their lords had given shelter to the Cathars. The other two, Tour Régine and Quertinheux, were added after 1240, when the site became royal property, and a garrison was maintained here as late as the Revolution. A path winds up from the roadside, bright in early summer with iris, cistus, broom and numerous other plants.

Narbonne
POP 51,306
The picturesque Canal de la Robine runs right through the centre of elegant Narbonne and connects the Étang de Bages-Sigean with the Canal du Midi. These days it's a charming midsize Languedoc market town, but wind the clock back two millennia and you’d be in a major Roman city: the capital of the province of Gallia Narbonensis. Exceptional sights include its cathedral and former archbishops' palace, and the town is now a popular stop-off for boaters.

Narbonne’s most distinctive landmark is actually only half-finished: construction was halted in the 14th century, and only the towers and choir reached final completion. Its treasury has a beautiful Flemish tapestry of the Creation, while grotesque gargoyles leer down upon the 16th-century cloister.

Founded by Cistercian monks in 1093, Fontfroide Abbey became one of southern France’s most powerful ecclesiastical centres during the Middle Ages. Heavily damaged during the Revolution, it was purchased in 1908 by the French painter Gustave Fayet and his wife, Madeleine, who restored much of the building. Highlights include the tranquil chapter hall, refectory and monks’ dormitory, as well as a rose garden added during the 18th century. It's 15km southwest of Narbonne via the D613. Cash payment only.
Fontfroide also produces its own renowned wine, which you can sample in the on-site wine shop or, better still, in the vaulted restaurant, La Table de Fontfroide ( GOOGLE MAP ; %04 68 41 02 26; www.fontfroide.com; chemin de Fontfroide; 2-/3-course lunch menus €21/25, 3-/4-course dinner menus €35/39; hnoon-2pm & 7-9.30pm Tue-Sat, noon-2pm Sun & Mon Jul & Aug, noon-2pm daily mid-Feb–Jun & Sep-late Dec).

Opened in 1974, this excellent 300-hectare wildlife reserve aims to recreate the atmosphere of the African savannah – a climate not all that different from the Languedoc’s dry and dusty plains. Lions, white rhinos, warthogs, giraffes and zebras are just a few of the 160 species on show, with some 3800 animals here in all. Some areas are drive-through, while others you explore on foot. The reserve is off the A9, 17km south of Narbonne.

Once a merchant’s house dating from 1860, this basic corner hotel just 150m from the train station is a decent base for overnighting in Narbonne. Some of the rooms are shoebox-sized, however, so insist on a ‘Double Confort’ room. There's a bike garage; parking is available at a nearby municipal car park.

Inspired flavour combinations on the daily-changing menu, sourced from Les Halles directly opposite, might include duck with truffled polenta, merlot-braised beef cheeks with lentils and heirloom carrots, and lemon sole with asparagus and saffron risotto, but the showstoppers are desserts like dark-chocolate ganache with raspberry sauce and hazelnut meringue or bourbon-vanilla-marinated pineapple crumble with chestnut ice cream.

WORTH A TRIP
MICHELIN-STAR SUPPERS

If you’re looking for a once-in-a-lifetime meal, two chefs tucked away in the countryside have won the hallowed three Michelin stars. Both also have accommodation.
Bras (%05 65 51 18 20; www.bras.fr; Laguiole; menus €140-220, mains €45-90; h7-9.30pm Tue & Wed, 11.30am-1.30pm & 7-9.30pm Thu-Sun early Apr-Nov, closed Dec-early Apr; W) Michel Bras has been based at the eponymous Bras in the village of Laguiole since 1999. His food is steeped in the rustic, country flavours of his youth, reinvented in all kinds of outlandish ways. It’s worth a trip for the restaurant alone: a modernist, plate-glass marvel, with views over Aubrac’s green hills. Double rooms start at €310. Unusually for a superstar chef, Michel Bras is self-made: he’s never strayed from his home on the Aubrac plateau, between the Massif Central and the Cévennes, and he learned many of his skills from his mother. He’s now handed over the reins to his son, Sébastien, but still makes regular appearances.
Auberge du Vieux Puits (%04 68 44 07 37; www.aubergeduvieuxpuits.fr; Fontjoncouse; menus €110-190; hnoon-1.30pm & 8-9.30pm Wed-Sat, noon-1.30pm Sun Mar-Dec, closed Jan & Feb; c) Gilles Goujon’s wonderfully relaxed Auberge du Vieux Puits is tucked away in the hilltop village of Fontjoncouse, between Narbonne and Perpignan. Goujon’s known for his fondness for humble ingredients such as Bigorre pork, woodcock, hare, boar and pigeon. The menus stretch between four and seven courses and include a ‘chariot of cheese’ that defies belief. Double rooms start at €165.
Carcassonne
POP 49,400
Perched on a rocky hilltop and bristling with zigzag battlements, stout walls and spiky turrets, the fortified city of Carcassonne looks like something out of a children’s storybook when it's seen from afar. A Unesco World Heritage Site since 1997, it’s most people’s idea of the perfect medieval castle.
La Cité, as the old walled town is now known, attracts over four million visitors every year, peaking in high summer. Time your visit for late in the day (or better still for spring and autumn) to truly appreciate the old town's medieval charm.
Sights
Beneath Carcassonne’s fortified castle La Cité, on the left bank of the Aude River, is the city’s second half, Ville Basse. It’s a mostly modern town that conceals a medieval heart: the Bastide St-Louis, which was built during the 13th century using the characteristic grid of streets set around a central square, place Carnot.
The lower town was later redeveloped during the 18th and 19th centuries, and is home to several impressive hôtels particuliers (private mansions) and religious buildings, as well as Carcassonne’s marvellous covered market, dating from 1768.
oLa CitéAREA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; enter via Porte Narbonnaise or Porte d'Aude; h24hr)
Built on a steep spur of rock, Carcassonne’s rampart-ringed fortress dates back over two millennia. The fortified town is encircled by two sets of battlements and 52 stone towers, topped by distinctive ‘witch’s hat’ roofs (added by architect Viollet-le-Duc during 19th-century restorations). A drawbridge can still be seen in the main gate of Porte Narbonnaise ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), which leads into the citadel’s interior, a maze of cobbled lanes and courtyards, now mostly lined by shops and restaurants.
The hill on which La Cité stands has been fortified many times across the centuries – by Gauls, Romans, Visigoths, Moors, Franks and Cathars, to name a few. Following the annexation of Roussillon by France in 1659, the castle’s usefulness as a frontier fortress declined and it slowly crumbled into disrepair, but it was saved from destruction by Viollet-le-Duc, who left his mark on many of France’s medieval landmarks, including Notre Dame in Paris and Vézelay in Burgundy.
The castle is laid out in a concentric pattern, with the double wall and defensive towers designed to resist attack from siege engines. The castle’s second gate, Porte d'Aude ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), was partly destroyed in 1816 and no longer has its drawbridge.
In between the walls, an interior space known as Les Lices runs for just over 1km around the castle. Though designed as a defensive space to delay would-be attackers, during the medieval era the city’s poorest residents would have built a shanty-town of houses and workshops here, which were cleared out during Viollet-le-Duc’s restorations. It’s now the best place to escape the crowds and properly appreciate the castle’s martial architecture.
To actually walk on the ramparts, you have to pay to enter the Château Comtal ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; place du Château, La Cité; adult/child €8.50/free; h10am-6.30pm Apr-Sep, 9.30am-5pm Oct-Mar), a keep built for the viscounts of Carcassonne during the 12th century. Admission includes access to the keep’s rooms and a section of the battlements, with fabulous views over the surrounding countryside and the distant Pyrenees. Guided tours in several languages are available in summer; check with the tourist office for schedules. It's free on the 1st Sunday of the month from November to March.
Before you leave, visit the lovely Basilique St-Nazaire ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; place St-Nazaire, La Cité; h9am-7pm Jul & Aug, to 6pm Sep-Jun) next to place du Château, notable for its Gothic transept and vivid rose windows. Often, traditional plain chant can be heard inside.
Pont-VieuxBRIDGE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Though it’s only one of several bridges spanning the Aude River, the Pont-Vieux is by far the oldest and prettiest. It was built during the 14th century to provide a quick link between Carcassonne’s lower and upper towns, and rebuilt in the 19th century. It’s one of the few surviving medieval bridges in France, prized for its graceful arches and compact dimensions, and is only open to pedestrians.
2Activities
When you've had your fill of architecture, take a canal cruise, go cycling or sample the local wines.
Boat Tours
Several companies offer cruises along the Canal du Midi, also a Unesco-listed wonder, providing a beautiful way to appreciate Carcassonne's architecture from afar surrounded by gorgeous countryside.
The main operators are Carcassonne Croisières ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %06 80 47 54 33; www.carcassonne-navigationcroisieres.com; Port de Plaisance; 1¼-hr cruise adult/child €8.50/6.50; h10.30am & 2pm Jul & Aug, 10.30am & 2.30pm Apr-Jun, Sep & Oct) and Le Cocagne ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %06 50 40 78 50; www.bateau-cocagne-canal-carcassonne.fr; Port de Plaisance; 1¼-hr cruise adult/child €8/6; h2pm & 6pm daily Jul & Aug, 2pm & 6pm Wed-Mon Apr-Jun, Sep & Oct). Standard cruises last around 1¼ hours, but there are longer trips available. All trips leave from the Port de Plaisance in the Ville Basse.
Wine Tasting
Experienced English-speaking company Vin en Vacances ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %06 42 33 34 09; www.vinenvacances.com; 10 rue du Pont Vieux; day tours €125-145) runs scheduled minibus tours of local vineyards from Carcassonne.
In town, most of the wines at cellar/wine-tasting establishment Vins & Vinos ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %04 68 10 97 04; www.vinsvinos.com; 38 rue Barbès; tastings from €15; h10am-6pm Tue-Fri, 9.30am-5pm Sat) come from the south of France but especially the Languedoc-Roussillon and Toulouse areas. Learn more about the terroirs and meet the winemakers during tastings and other events; check the program online.
4Sleeping
Sleeping inside the old city may seem romantic, but you might think twice once you’ve lugged your bags through the alleyways. As vehicles are banned, if you're driving you'll have to leave your car outside the city walls overnight. Staying outside the walled city is more practical (and invariably cheaper).
Auberge de JeunesseHOSTEL€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %04 68 25 23 16; www.hifrance.org; rue du Vicomte Trencavel, La Cité; dm incl breakfast €25; hclosed mid-Dec–Jan & weekends Feb; iW)
This HI hostel is smack bang in the centre of La Cité – great for atmosphere, not great if you’re arriving at the train station 4km downhill to the northwest. Facilities include four- to six-bed dorms, a spacious kitchen, an outside terrace and bike rental. It’s very popular, so book well ahead.

It’s not going to win any style awards, but this 22-room budget hotel is great value for Carcassonne. Rooms are small and bathrooms are basic, but it's just 500m east of the train station, and the private parking (€5 outside, €8 under cover) is a bonus. Bike rental is available for €10 per day.

( GOOGLE MAP ; %06 23 40 65 34; www.la-maison-vieille.com; 8 rue Trivalle; d €90-95, f €105-125; W)
As charming a B&B as you’ll find in Carcassonne, this old mansion's beautiful rooms include Barbacane in blues, Cité with exposed brick, Prince Noir with an in-room bath, and vintage-furnished Dame Carcas. Filled with fig trees, olive trees and lavender, its walled courtyard is idyllic for breakfast. It's handy for the walled city and Ville Basse; families are warmly welcomed.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %04 68 71 98 71; www.hoteldelacite.fr; place Auguste-Pierre-Pont, La Cité; s/d/f from €230/270/350; aWs)
Built in the 19th century in the Gothic Revival style, this is Carcassonne's most magnificent place to stay. Palatial rooms are individually appointed, many with wood panelling and/or timber beams, and some have panoramic private terraces. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the private library, which has its own bar, and there's a topiary-flanked swimming pool. Its Michelin-starred restaurant, La Barbacane, is sublime.
Eating
Restaurants in La Cité tend to be touristy; you’ll find more authentic fare at better value in the Ville Basse.
On menus you’ll often see cassoulet – a stew of vegetables, white beans and meat that is said to have been invented in the nearby village of Castelnaudry. Quality varies, so be choosy about where you try it.
Markets take place in Ville Basse on place Carnot on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday mornings.
Les HallesMARKET€

This lively local hang-out is full of office workers at lunchtime, so you know you’re in good hands. It’s great for no-fuss bistro standards, such as roast Camembert, classic steak-frites and tapas platters, and the location on place Carnot is a winner. The children's menu offers petite versions of main dishes.

In an old shuttered auberge (country inn), complete with beams and original hearth, this family-run bistro serves meaty cassoulet, along with Mediterranean-influenced dishes such as lamb with parsnip gnocchi, foie gras ravioli, aubergine and spinach cannelloni, and sea bass with squid-ink spaghetti. Ask for a table in the courtyard if it’s sunny.

The citadel location bumps up the prices considerably, but this is one of the better establishments for traditional cassoulet. The restaurant's smart dining room has cream-coloured chairs and tables and polished wooden floors, but the best seats are in the vine-draped courtyard beside an old well.

A modern dining space of white walls, white chairs and white tables is reflected in the short lunch menu of salads and tartes salées (savoury tarts), and creative versions of southwestern French classics such as l'ouillade (hearty soup made from pig's trotters, cabbage and turnips) of an evening, along with great local wines by the glass. Also has guest rooms (doubles €10).

Accessed via antique gates, Fred’s Place is a relaxed bistro set around a courtyard. Tuck into sensational cassoulet or adventurous dishes such as plum-marinated pork, pumpkin risotto or roast chicken with olive tapenade. Kids get a pared-down version of adults' cuisine on the children's menu.

Carcassonne's finest dining is inside the Hôtel de la Cité at chef Jérôme Ryon's Michelin-starred premises. Opulent carved woodwork and stained glass set the stage for unforgettable dishes utilising some of France's finest produce: poached Bouzigues oysters with preserved lemon; Charolais beef with potato churros and Perigord sauce; and Languedoc-grown saffron, white asparagus and black-garlic risotto with Cévennes goat's cheese.

Perpignan
POP 123,000
Framed by the peaks of the Pyrenees 13km west of the Mediterranean coastline and just 38km north of the Spanish border, Perpignan radiates out from the tight knot of the old town's warren of alleys, palm-shaded squares and shabby tenements painted in shades of lemon, peach and tangerine.
Historically, Perpignan (Perpinyà in Catalan) was capital of the kingdom of Mallorca, a Mediterranean power that stretched northwards as far as Montpellier and included all the Balearic Islands; the Mallorcan kings’ palace still stands guard at the southern end of the old town.
Its proximity to Spain means the town is strong on fiestas.



1Sights
Perpignan’s old town is roughly contained within the main ring roads of bd des Pyrénees in the west, bd Thomas Wilson in the north, bd Anatole France in the east, and bd Henri Poincaré in the south. Its shallow canal skirts its western edge.
Cars are banned in the centre, so if you’re driving you’ll have to park in one of the large municipal car parks on the edges of the old town.

Perpignan’s most dominant monument, the Palace of the Kings of Mallorca sprawls over a huge area to the south of the old town. Built in 1276, the castle was later refortified with massive red-brick walls by Louis XIV's military engineer, Vauban. These days the star-shaped citadel is sparsely furnished, but its great battlements and strategic defences still give a sense of the Mallorcan kings’ might. Views from the ramparts stretch over Perpignan’s terracotta rooftops to the coast.

Like many medieval towns, Perpignan was once encircled by defensive walls. Today all that remains is the red-brick town gate of Le Castillet, at the northern end of the old town. Inside the gateway is the Casa Païral museum, displaying Catalan ephemera from traditional bonnets and lace mantillas to an entire 17th-century kitchen.

Perpignan’s old town has several intriguing churches, but the most impressive is the Cathédrale St-Jean, begun in 1324 and not completed until 1509. Topped by a Provençal wrought-iron bell cage, the cathedral has a flat façade of red brick and smooth, zigzagging river stones.
Inside, the fine carving and ornate altarpiece are characteristically Catalan, and the simple statue of the Virgin and child in the north aisle is a venerated relic.

The cave-riddled cliffs above Tautavel, 34km northwest of Perpignan along the D117, have yielded a host of prehistoric finds, most notably a human skull unearthed in the Arago Cave that's estimated to be 450,000 years old (one of Europe's oldest such discoveries). The fascinating museum here delves into the area’s prehistoric past, with a full-size cave reproduction, displays of fossilised bones and tools, and multimedia exhibits. Admission includes a secondary exhibition at Musée des Premiers Habitants d'Europe, 500m southeast.
There's no public transport, so you'll need your own wheels.

5Eating
Perpignan's dining scene is a melange of French and Spanish cuisines, along with wider Mediterranean influences.
Rue Paratilla, known to locals as rue des Épices (Spice St), has an aromatic concentration of foodie shops (delis, greengrocers, charcuteries, fishmongers and, yes, spice shops).

Favourites include langoustine ravioli, gnocchi Gorgonzola, salmon lasagne, and olive, basil and bresaola (aged, air-dried salted beef) pappardelle. Mains span anchovy-stuffed veal to juicy, grilled, sliced beef tagliata, but don't expect pizza, which it resolutely doesn't serve.

On up-and-coming av du Général Leclerc, this is one of Perpignan’s best-value bistros, run with care by a husband-and-wife team.

Warm colours, tinkling jazz and walls covered in vintage signs give this cosy place the air of an old-time Parisian bistro. It’s a great bet for French favourites (confit de canard; steak-frites) and you can watch the chef at work in the semi-open kitchen.

Céret
POP 7885
Tucked in the Pyrenean foothills just off the Tech Valley, the little town of Céret conceals an unexpected surprise – one of southern France’s best modern-art museums, with a collection of stellar canvases donated by some of the 20th century’s foremost names from cubism to neorealism.
Lively festivals also take place in the town in spring and summer.
1Sights & Activities
oMusée d’Art ModerneART MUSEUM
(www.musee-ceret.com; 8 bd Maréchal Joffre; adult/child €5.50/3.50, incl temporary exhibitions €8/6; h10am-7pm Jul-Sep, to 5.30pm Tue-Sun Oct-Jun)
Roussillon had its artistic heyday around the turn of the 20th century, when Fauvist and cubist artists flocked here, attracted by the searing colours and sun-drenched landscapes. This wonderful museum was created in 1950 by Pierre Brune and Frank Burty Haviland, who convinced friends including Picasso, Matisse, Chaïm Soutine and Georges Braque to donate works. The result is one of the finest collections of modern art outside Paris. Take your time – this place is a real treat.
Céret’s artistic connections stretch back to 1910, when Catalan sculptor Manolo Hugué, painter Frank Burty Haviland and composer Déodat de Séverac settled here. They were followed in 1911 by Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, along with other significant figures from the cubist and Fauvist movements, mostly escaping the spiralling rents and stifling atmosphere of the Montmartre art scene.
All the big names passed through Céret, sometimes staying for a short while, sometimes for extended periods. Reading like a who’s who of modern art, the list includes André Masson, Max Jacob, Juan Gris, Raoul Dufy, Jean Cocteau, Chaïm Soutine, Amedeo Modigliani, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dalí and Joan Miró among them.
After the museum’s formation in 1950, many of these artists (or their estates) chose to donate their works for free in recognition of Céret’s importance to their artistic development (Picasso alone donated 57 pieces, although only one painting, a still life of a dead crane and a jug).
Standout works include a moving Crucifixion (1925) by Marc Chagall, Woman, Bird, Stars by Joan Miró, and a famous cubist view of Céret by Chaïm Soutine, painted in 1919 – but there are many more to discover.

Canyoning and via ferrata trips in the Pyrenees are organised year-round by Aquacanyon; in summer it also offers white-water rafting, while in the cooler winter months you can go rock climbing.
4Sleeping & Eating
There are several places to sleep in and around the town, but Céret's proximity to Perpignan, 30km to the northeast, means it's easy to visit as a day trip.

Villefranche-de-Conflent
POP 223
The Unesco-listed town of Villefranche-de-Conflent sits in a breathtaking spot, hemmed in by tall cliffs, at the strategic confluence of the valleys of the Têt and Cady Rivers. Built by Vauban, its fort dominates the valley and you can walk along the walled town's ramparts. From Villefranche, the famous mountain railway Le Train Jaune runs through the Pyrenees almost to the Spanish border.
1Sights & Activities
RampartsHISTORIC SITE

Villefranche’s mighty fort dominates the skyline above town. Built by Vauban in 1681, it was heavily refortified by Napoléon III between 1850 and 1856. You can wander around its corner turrets and battlements, as well as the defensive keep and a former prison. A shuttle bus from town (adult/child return €10/5.10) saves you a steep climb up 734 steps.
Le Train JauneRAIL
(%04 68 96 63 62; www.tersncf.com; adult/child one way €10/5)
Nicknamed Le Canari (the Canary), this bright-yellow mountain railway trundles from Villefranche-de-Conflent (427m) through spectacular Pyrenean scenery to Latour de Carol (1231m). One of France’s most famous train trips, attracting 400,000 passengers annually, it doesn't take bookings, so arrive a good hour before departure. It makes scheduled stops at eight of its 22 stations; you can alight at the others on request.
At Latour de Carol you can return to Villefranche or change for Toulouse or Barcelona.
8Getting There & Away
Bus 240 links Villefranche-de-Conflent with Perpignan (€1, 1¼ hours, five daily Monday to Saturday, no services Sunday). Buses 240 and 241 serve Vernet-les-Bains (€1, 15 minutes, seven daily Monday to Saturday, no services Sunday).

Côte Vermeille
Named for its red rock, the Côte Vermeille (Vermilion Coast) runs south from Collioure to Cerbère on the Spanish border, where the Pyrenees foothills dip to the sea. Against a backdrop of vineyards and pinched between the Mediterranean and the mountains, it’s riddled with small, rocky bays and little ports.
The main town here is Collioure. Three kilometres to its south, Port-Vendres, Roussillon’s only natural harbour and deep-water port, has been exploited ever since Greek mariners roamed the rocky coastline. Until the independence of France’s North African territories in the 1960s, it was an important port linking them with the mainland. It’s still a significant cargo and fishing harbour, however, with everything from small coastal chuggers to giant deep-sea vessels bristling with radar. There’s also a large leisure marina, and lots of pleasant walks around the coastline nearby.
8Getting There & Away
Buses and trains run regularly along the coast from Perpignan. If you’re driving, you can follow the lovely coastal roads all the way to Banyuls-sur-Mer.
Collioure
POP 3096
Collioure, where boats bob against a backdrop of houses washed in soft pastel colours, is the smallest and most picturesque of the Côte Vermeille resorts. Once Perpignan’s port, it found fame in the early 20th century when it inspired the Fauvist artists Henri Matisse and André Derain and later both Picasso and Braque.
Today the town has more than 30 galleries and workshops, including many on rue de la Fraternité. Collioure is also famed for its wine and its prized Collioure anchovies. Like most beaches along the Côte Vermeille, Collioure’s main town beach is shingly, but pleasant enough for a paddle.

(%04 68 82 06 43; www.cg66.fr; Port Plaisance; adult/child €4/2; h10am-7pm Jul & Aug, 9am-5pm Sep-Jun)
Collioure’s seaside castle was mostly built between 1276 and 1344 by the counts of Roussillon and the kings of Aragon, and was later occupied by the Mallorcan court, although the outer wall was the work of Vauban in the 17th century. Interior furnishings are minimal, but the hybrid Spanish-French architectural styles are striking and the coastal views lovely. Markets, concerts and theatre performances take place in the grounds throughout the year.
Musée d’Art ModerneART MUSEUM
(4 rte de Port-Vendres; adult/child €3/free; h10am-noon & 2-6pm Jun-Sep, 10am-noon & 2-6pm Wed-Mon Oct-May)
Boat sketches by Matisse and Edouard Pignon along with coastal canvases by Henri Martin and Henri Marre are among the highlights of this small but worthwhile museum. It has a good collection of mainly 20th-century canvases and holds regular exhibitions by local artists.
Moulin de la CortinaLANDMARK
(Parc Pams)
The most scenic way to reach this 14th-century windmill is a 950m walk through olive and almond groves from Fort St-Elme along the Cami del Port de Sant Telm (about 20 minutes). Alternatively, it's a steep 150m walk from the Musée d'Art Moderne. Mediterranean views of boats, rocky coast and brilliant blue sea extend from the mill's raised base.
Fort St-ElmeFORTRESS

2Activities
Le Chemin de FauvismeWALKING
During the early 20th century, Collioure’s vibrant coastal hues and piercing light attracted a group of artists known as the Fauves (the Wild Animals), whose focus was pure colour. The tourist office has a free map of the Chemin de Fauvisme, a walking trail taking in 19 locations that featured in works by Henri Matisse and his younger colleague André Derain.

It’s a toss-up whether the setting or the food steals the show here. Overlooking Collioure’s brilliant blue bay and red rooftops, the panoramic seaside terrace (covered and heated in winter) is an absolute stunner, while local ingredients span just-landed turbot to just-cooked lobster. The style is formal, so you'll need to dress up.

Banyuls-sur-Mer

Just 14km north of the Spanish border, Banyuls is a small coastal town that began life as a fishing port but is now best known for its wines (Banyuls, Banyuls Grand Cru and Collioure). Grapes grow on the slopes around town on steep, rocky terraces divided by drystone walls, which help retain water and prevent soil erosion.
It’s a lovely spot, with three shingly but superb beaches (Centrale, Les Elmes and Centre Hélio Marin) with translucent turquoise waters, and an important marine reserve, the Réserve Naturelle Cerbère-Banyuls, 6km southeast of town, where you can snorkel and scuba dive. Banyuls is also a convenient stop-off if you’re heading over the border into Spain.
