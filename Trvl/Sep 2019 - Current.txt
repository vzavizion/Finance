	main public entrance is via the courtyard of the Winter Palace off Palace Sq


	tickets
		pay at the computerised ticket machines in the main entrance courtyard and be sure to wait for your tickets to be printed at the end of the transaction (they come after the payment receipt)
	
			if u going to Hermitage, don't bother to buy the advance tickets coz there is only 1 booth open for exchange voucher with huge line up. Go to the normal ticket booths, lines moving very fast with lots of them open
				
			if you don't want to buy tickets in advance and you see a line when you get to the museum just use ticket-booth near the archway in the couryard
				in order to skip the line you simply need to purchase tickets in the ticket machine
				
			we never buy our tickets for the H online--no point in that. On the right hand side in the courtyard after you walk through the big gate you can buy your tickets from an automatic ticket machine with a credit card; you do NOT have to stand in line to get into the Museum with the visitors who have no tickets (use the right lane if I remember correctly). You then breeze into the building and turn left again in front of the information desk to buy the special ticket for the Gold Room from the booth on your left		
			
			
		alternatively avoid possibly long entrance queues by buying your ticket online
			printed-out voucher or PDF on a wi-fi–enabled device is valid for 180 days

			
	
	tours
		contact the excursions office to arrange a guided tour. 
			these are one way to avoid queuing 
			about 1.5 hours, but it’s easy to ‘lose’ the group and stay on until closing time

	TA - for TB only
		Hermitage is crowded not without the reason... You can avoid walking through the Rembandts, but surely visit historical rooms and enjoy marbles, ceilings and floorings
		
		go straight for the brilliant collection of romantics, impressionists & post-impressionists in the Admiralty building. Never any lines or crowds, there, even in peak season, 'cause the big tours just herd everybody through the collection of old masters in the Winter Palace

These were oil-fired navigation beacons in the 1800s and their gas torches are still lit on some holidays, which makes for a breathtaking sight

		Mikhailovsky Palace and the attached Benois Wing
			main building
			fascinating collection of Russian art from medieval icons to 20th-century avant-garde masterpieces
		???
		Marble Palace
			focus on contemporary works
		!
		Stroganov Palace 
			some of the most spectacular interiors in the city
			
		Mikhailovsky Castle


	Mikhailovsky Palace
		designed by Carlo Rossi and built between 1819 and 1825. It was a gift for Grand Duke Mikhail (brother of Tsars Alexander I and Nicholas I) as compensation for missing out on the throne. Nicholas II opened it as a public gallery on 7 March 1898
		
		museum originated from the collection begun by Tsar Alexander III, whose bust greets you on the magnificent main staircase
			
		attached Benois Wing 
			houses pieces from the 20th century. It was constructed between 1914 and 1919 and is connected to the original palace. It is accessible through an entrance on nab kanala Griboyedova.		

			
	collection
		enter the Mikhailovsky Palace's lower floor to the right of the main facade. Pick up a museum map before ascending the magnificent main staircase to the 1st floor, as this is where the chronological ordering of the exhibits from the 10th to the 20th century begins


		Rooms 1–4: Religious Icons
			brilliant history of Russian icon painting, including work from the three major schools of Russian icon painting: Novgorod, Muscovy and Pskov
			
			Room 2 
				St Nicholas the Miracle Worker with Life
			
			Room 3 
				features Russian master Andrei Rublev’s massive paintings of the apostles Peter and Paul as well as his Presentation
			
			Room 4 
				snotable in its departure from earlier styles. Compare Old Testament Trinity with Scenes from Genesis (c. 1408) with the completely atypical Our Father (1669)

			
		???
		Rooms 5–7: Petrine & Post-Petrine Art
			Room 6 
				some charmingly odd canvases in very strange shapes as well as mosaic portraits of both Peter and Catherine the Great, as well as of Elizabeth I, Peter’s daughter. The centre of the room is taken up by a huge portrait of the ill-fated Peter III, but look out for the impressive bust of Prince Menshikov
				
			Room 7 
				amazingly ornate ceiling. The room houses a sculpture of Empress Anna with an Arab Boy and a few impressive tapestries, including one that depicts Peter the Great at the Battle of Poltava, his greatest military victory
				
				
		???
		Rooms 8–11: Rise of the Academy
				early works of the St Petersburg Academy of Arts. These artists borrowed the European classical aesthetic for their work
		
				!!!
				Room 11 
					Rossi-designed White Hall, which was Grand Duke Mikhail’s drawing room. Here, the interior is the art – in this case representing the Empire epoch. It’s wonderfully ornate and shiny – a perfect place to host musical greats like Strauss and Berlioz, who performed here


		???
		Rooms 12–17: Dominance of the Academy
				
				Room 12 
					Vladimir Borovikovsky’s magnificent Catherine II Promenading in Tsarskoe Selo and his Portrait of Murtaza Kuli, his picture of the brother of the Persian Shah
					
				Room 13 
					full of paintings of peasant subjects with uplifting titles such as Peeling Beetroot.

				!!!
				Room 14
					truly spectacular, including enormous canvases such as Karl Bryullov’s incredible The Last Day of Pompeii and The Crucifixion, and Ivan Aivazovsky's terrifying The Wave
					
				Room 15 
					impressive, with the far wall made up of studies for Alexander Ivanov’s masterpiece The Appearance of Christ Before the People (1837–57), which hangs in Moscow’s Tretyakov Gallery. Ivanov spent 20 years on this work, but it was met with a negative critical reception. However, later generations appreciated the work, and even these studies, many of which mark a notable departure in terms of detail and representation

					
		???			
		Rooms 18–22: Genre Painting
			Rooms 18 and 20
				incredibly idealised rural Russia
			
			Room 19 
				some beautiful portraits by Ivan Kramskoi, including ones of his daughter Sofia and fellow painter Ivan Shishkin
				
			Room 21 
				enormous canvases: Phrina at the Poseidon Celebration in Elesium by Genrikh Semiradsky, Christian Martyrs at the Colosseum by Konstantin Flavitsky and Nero’s Death by Vasily Smirnov
				
			Room 22 
				huge rendition of Pugachev's Judgement by Vasily Perov.
				
			
		???
		Rooms 23–24: The Wanderers
			works by the Wanderers (Peredvizhniki), a group of Academy artists who saw their future outside the strict confines of that institution. They wandered among the people, painting scenes of realism that had never been seen before in Russian art. Prime examples include Nikolai Perov's animated Hunters at Rest and the Monastery Refectory, a scathing critique of the Church establishment's greed. Also keep an eye out for Pavel Christiakov's serene Jovannina Sitting on Window Sill.

		
		???		
		Rooms 25 & 26: Konstantin Makovsky & Nicholas Ghe
			Room 25 
				devoted to Konstantin Makovsky (1839–1915), who painted the incredibly cinematic Festivity During the Carnival on Admiralty Sq in St Petersburg at the age of just 30. Also a standout is his portrait of his wife Julija

			Room 26
				Ghe’s masterpiece, Peter I Interrogating Tsarevich Alexey in Peterhof, along with other dark Ghe works such as The Last Supper
				
		???
		Rooms 27–32: Landscapes & Portraits
			landscape artists such as Ivan Shishkin were still popular. These rooms also document the rise of populist art, which had a strong social conscience and sought to educate the public. Examples of this are Konstantin Savitsky’s To War (Room 31) and Grigory Myasoyedov's lyrical Harvest Time

			Room 28 
				pause to take in the talent of Ukrainian artist Marie Bashkirtseff (1858–84) who died young but not before painting striking portraits, such as Umbrella and the Three Smiles series

		
		Rooms 33–34: Ilya Repin
			Barge Haulers on the Volga 
			Cossacks Writing a Letter to the Turkish Sultan
			marvellous portrait of a barefoot Leo Tolstoy.
			
			
		???
		Rooms 35–47: Late-19th-Century Russian Art
			large number of contradictory styles that were fashionable in St Petersburg before the explosion of the avant-garde
			
			
		???
		Rooms 48–49: Antokolsky’s Sculptures & Folk Art
			Mark Antokolsky’s statues Ivan the Terrible and Death of Socrates are on display



		From here you enter the Benois Wing to your right or continue straight ahead for the comprehensive account of Russian folk art, a really lovely display featuring everything from kitchen equipment to giant carved house gables. Room 49 is a long corridor devoted to the museum's history showcasing old photos and posters from past exhibitions
				

		Rooms 66–71: Early-20th-Century Art
			2nd floor of the Benois Wing
			
			Room 66
				works by the father of modern Russian art, Mikhail Vrubel. Some of his groundbreaking works include Epic Hero (Bogatyr) and Flying Demon				
				
			Rooms 67 to 71 
				works by an array of important early-20th-century painters including Nikolai Sapunin, Mikhail Nesterov and Boris Kustodiev, whose Merchant’s Wife at Tea is perhaps the most well-known picture here
				
		!!!
		Rooms 72–78: Russian Avant-Garde Painting
			
			Room 72 
				home to Nathan Altman’s gorgeous, semi-cubist Portrait of the Poetess Anna Akhmatova, painted in 1914, and it remains one of his most famous works even though Akhmatova apparently didn’t care for it herself. In the same room is Altman’s striking Self Portrait (1911)
				
			Room 74 
				contains primitivist paintings by artist couple Natalya Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov
				
				
			Rooms 75 to 76
				futurism and suprematism, including works by Malevich such as Black Square and Vladimir Tatlin's Counter Relief
				
			Room 77 
				devoted to constructivism and features works by Alexander Rodchenko and Vladimir Lebedev
			
			Room 78
				displays the bright, ethereal work of Pavel Filonov
				
			
		???
		Rooms 80–81: Early Soviet Art
			paintings from the Stalin era
			

		???
		Rooms 82–86: Late Soviet Art
			with Stalin gone and the ‘thaw’ under way in the 1950s, Soviet art recovered somewhat from the severity of socialist realism. Idealised images of rural life and peasants still feature very strongly, however. Look for Alexei Sundukov's Queue which captures the failed economy of the times and Dmitry Zhilinsky's The Artist's Family, showing several generations of a family
			
						
		Rooms 87–94: Applied & Decorative Art
			Works in these galleries range from a beautifully glazed ceramic fireplace by Mikhail Vrubel and other art nouveau–inspired pieces, to Soviet-era porcelain and textiles printed with ingenious patterns made out of tiny tractors or planes
			
			
		Rooms 101–109: Temporary Exhibitions
			to reach these from the 1st floor of the Benois Wing (following your tour of the museum's main collection), use the stairs down off rooms 91 and 92

		built between 1768 and 1785, the palace was a gift from Catherine the Great to Grigory Orlov for suppressing a Moscow rebellion. Outside it stands the equestrian statue of Alexander III

		Impressionists & Post-Impressionists
		
			inspired by romanticism, a group of painters in the 1860s began experimenting with painting modern life and landscapes, endeavouring to capture the overall effect of a scene instead of being overly concerned with details. The new trend – radical in its time – was known as Impressionism
		

			arguably the best collection in the world of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings
				much of this artwork was displayed for the first time in the 1990s, when the museum revealed some fabulous pieces, kept secret since seizure by the Red Army from Germany at the end of WWII
				
				
			Room 403
				Monet's early piece Lady in a Garden and his late-career masterpiece Waterloo Bridge, Effect of Mist (1903)

			Rooms 407 & 408
				Renoir's celebrated Portrait of the Actress Jeanne Samary (1878) and the iconic Child With a Whip (1885)

			Room 410
				Cézanne's Mont Sainte-Victoire, Lady in Blue and The Smoker

			Rooms 411 & 412
				works by Gauguin including the primitive works that he created in Tahiti

			Room 413
				Van Gogh's Thatched Cottages (1890) and the dreamy Memory of the Garden at Etten (1888)


		???
		Barbizon School
			next to Room 452 is a series of unnumbered rooms displaying works from the Barbizon School, named for the village in France where this group of artists settled. They were reacting against romanticism, the prevailing school of art for the earlier part of the 19th century, and making a move towards realism
				Gustave Courbet
				Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot
				Théôdore Rousseau
				Jean-François Millet

			
			
		!!!
		Russian Avant-Garde
			Room 444
				couple of Kandinsky’s early works
				Kazimir Malevich's Black Square (1915), the most striking painting of the Petrograd avant-garde
					
					Malevich created several variants of the simple black square against a white background throughout his career, of which this is the fourth and last. It was taken by many as a nihilistic declaration of the ‘end of painting’, causing both awe and outrage
					
					Black Square went missing during the Soviet period, mysteriously reappearing in southern Russia in 1993. Oligarch Vladimir Potanin bought the painting for $US1 million and donated it to the Hermitage in 2002.


		!!!
		20th Century
			Rooms 430 to 440
				over 40 paintings by Matisse and almost as many by Picasso
					
					Henri Matisse was initially classified as a Fauvist, but he continued to paint in his own particular style, even as Fauvism declined in the early 20th century. Around this time, Matisse met Pablo Picasso and the two became lifelong friends. Picasso is best known as the founder and master of cubism, but again his work spanned many styles.

					A turning point for Matisse – and perhaps his most famous work – is The Dance (1910). The intense colours and the dancing nudes convey intense feelings of freedom. This panel – along with the accompanying The Music – was painted specifically for Russian businessman Sergei Shchukin. While these panels are certainly commanding, don’t miss The Red Room and Portrait of the Artist’s Wife.

					Picasso’s blue period is characterised by sombre paintings in shades of blue. When he was only 22, he painted The Absinthe Drinker, a haunting portrait of loneliness and isolation. The sensuous Dance of the Veils (1907) and Woman with a Fan (1908) are excellent representations of his cubist work, as are the ceramics on display here.

		French architect Auguste de Montferrand began designing the cathedral in 1818. Due partly to technical issues, it took so long to build (until 1858) that Nicholas I was able to insist on an even more grandiose structure than Montferrand had originally planned. More than 100kg of gold leaf was used to cover the 21.8m-high dome alone, while the huge granite pillars on the building’s facade each weigh over 120 tonnes. There’s a statue of Montferrand holding a model of the cathedral on the west facade, although Nicholas I denied the architect his dying wish, to be buried here, considering it too high an honour for a mere artisan

	Fabergé founded his jewellery business in St Petersburg in 1842. At its height he employed 700 people across many factories and in four shops in Russia and one in London. The tradition of tsars giving their wives jewelled Easter eggs began in 1885 when Alexander III commissioned the 37-year-old Fabergé to create a present for his Danish wife Maria Feodorovna. From 1897, the new tsar Nicholas II asked the jeweller to continue making the eggs for his mother, now the Dowager Empress, and his own wife Alexandra Feodorovna

	TA
		99% chance you'll have the whole palace to yourself and the place is fantastic!
	
	built to the grandiose tastes of Prince Alexander Menshikov, Peter the Great’s closest friend and the first governor of St Petersburg
		interiors are some of the oldest and best preserved in the city
		St Petersburg’s first stone building.


	Menshikov was of humble origins (he is said to have sold pies on the streets of Moscow as a child), but his talent for both organisation and intrigue made him the second-most important person in the Russian Empire by the time of Peter’s death in 1725. His palace, built mainly between 1710 and 1714, was the city’s smartest residence at the time (compare it to Peter the Great’s tiny Summer Palace across the river). Peter used Menshikov's palace for official functions
	
	the 1st floor displays some stunning Dutch tile work, intended to fortify the rooms against humidity to help ease Menshikov’s tuberculosis. Original furniture and the personal effects of Menshikov are on display and each room has a fact sheet in English explaining its history. Vavara’s Chamber is particularly evocative of how the aristocracy lived during Peter’s time, while the impressive Walnut Study also stands out

	also of note is the magnificent Grand Hall, where balls and banquets were held, including the infamous reception for Peter's dwarf wedding, in which Peter and his court sniggered as some 70-odd dwarfs from all over Russia attended the wedding and the subsequent drunken party of Peter's favourite dwarf

	Bronze Horseman

		most famous statue of Peter the Great - horse (representing Russia) rearing above the snake of treason

		statue was sculpted over 12 years for Catherine the Great by Frenchman Etienne Falconet. Its inscription reads ‘To Peter I from Catherine II – 1782’
			despite completing his lifework here, Falconet departed Russia a bitter, angry man. Years of arguing with the head of the Academy of Fine Arts over the finer details of the sculpture had taken its toll, and he didn’t even bother staying for the unveiling

		"micro Peterhof" in the sense of fountains/garden
		
		early-18th-century architects designed the garden in a Dutch baroque style, following a geometric plan, with fountains, pavilions and sculptures studding the grounds

		gardens functioned as a private retreat for Peter the Great. Only in the 20th century were commoners admitted
		
		92 marble statues, busts and sculptural groups that decorate parts of the garden are replicas: the 18th-century originals are housed in the Mikhailovsky Castle

	Kazan Cathedral

		8.30am-7.30pm
		
		commissioned by Tsar Paul shortly before he was murdered in a coup
			design reflects Paul's eccentric desire to unite Catholicism and Orthodoxy in a kind of ‘super-Christianity’ as well as his fascination with the Knights of Malta, of which he was a member
		
		neoclassical cathedral, partly modelled on St Peter’s in Rome
			inside, the cathedral is dark and traditionally Orthodox, with a daunting 80m-high dome
			there is usually a queue of believers waiting to kiss the icon of Our Lady of Kazan, a copy of one of Russia’s most important icons
		
		look for the victorious Napoleonic War field marshal Mikhail Kutuzov (whose remains are buried inside the cathedral) and his friend and aide Mikhail Barclay de Tolly.

	flat fare for a trip is R45
	
	if you wish to buy a single journey, ask for ‘adin proyezd’ and you will be given a zheton (token) to put in the machine
	
	if you are staying more than a day or two, however, it’s worth buying a smart card (R60), which is good for multiple journeys to be used over the course of a fixed time period – for example, 10 trips in seven days for R355. Their main advantage is that you won’t have to line up to buy tickets – the ticket counters can have very long lines during peak hours

		Peterhof Express 
			OW/RT R800/1500
			
			hydrofoil - expensive but highly enjoyable way to get to Peterhof
				you arrive right in front of the palace				
				
				first hydrofoil leaves at 9am
				
				hydrofoil trip at 10am from St. Petersburg to Peterhof - arrive right before for Gala Launch of Grand Cascade
				
				trip takes 30 minutes
			
			departs from the jetty in front of the Admiralty every 30 minutes from 9am
			last hydrofoil leaves Peterhof at 7pm
			
			!!!Important
			if you want to return with hydrofoil, then you'll have to get to it through Lower Gardens and you have to buy 1 more ticket for Lower Gardens because you cannot return to Lower Gardens after you leave them
				Most people go there by hydrofoil and back by bus

					take marshrutka/mini bus to Avtovo metro station (around 45 mins)

	almost all pavilions in Peterhof work by the following way: you buy a ticket, and when a group of approx 10 people gathers, a guide from the place leads them inside
	
	remember to bring mosquito repellent - the mosquitoes on the palace grounds are fierce
	
			
	tickets
		it’s extraordinarily expensive to see all the attractions from the inside, as they each charge separate hefty admission fees
	
		on arrival, you’ll need to pay to enter the grounds of the palace, known as the Lower Park, and then for each additional sight within it
		
		online tickets can be purchased for the Grand Palace, which can avoid long lines in the summer months
			bought tickets online for 6pm entrance and went right in. Lines here are huge and ticket offices close for an hour breaks leaving people in line waiting		
			
		no need to buy Lower Gardens tickets online
			park tickets are unlimited so just pay at the ticket office at the entrance 900 roubles			
			
			
			
	reconstruction, as Peterhof was a major casualty of WWII
		apart from the damage done by the Germans, the palace suffered the worst under Soviet bombing raids in December 1941 and January 1942, because Stalin was determined to thwart Hitler’s plan of hosting a New Year’s victory celebration here

		jaw-dropping collection of gilded fountains, statue-lined lanes, and picturesque canals
		
			Water Avenue + over-the-top Grand Cascade
				canal leading from the hydrofoil dock to the palace. It culminates in the magnificent Grand Cascade, a symphony of over 140 fountains engineered in part by Peter himself. The central statue of Samson tearing open a lion’s jaws celebrates – as so many things in St Petersburg do – Peter’s victory over the Swedes at Poltava. Shooting up 62m, it was unveiled by Rastrelli for the 25th anniversary of the battle in 1735			
				
			trick fountains that douse unsuspecting visitors
			
		
		I'd enter the Lower Garden at ~9.45am and turn right to see the fountains starting at 10am. Walking from a fountain to cascade & then trick fountains (all in all 147 in Peterhof!) you'll get the 'Sheaf' fountain in front of Peter's home-Monplaisir. Step into a terrace behind Monplaisir for a breathtaking sea view! If you want to be by the Grand Cascade at 11am, when it's switched on and music tricks the ceremony, take a diagonal alley from the 'Adam' fountain to cut the way to the Grand Cascade. Crowds of people will be there to spoil your pictures. But usually in 10 min later the place looks qieter. After that cross the Marine Canal to see the western part of the Lower Park with the 'Marly', 'Hermitage', 'Lions' & 'Gold Hill' Cascades
		
			last season we took the first boat operated by 'Vodohod' at 9.35-9.40am. Its dock is opposite the Winter Palace. Be sure there will be a line (5-6 people) to a ticket booth at the pier. Upon the arrival to Peterhof (~40min) you can decide on the spot where to go. The Grand Palace is visible at the end of the Marine Canal (5 min walk), Monplaisir - to the left, on the sea shore (10 min)		
		
		
		tour to the Grottos of Grand Cascade

			Peter’s Study
			
			
			
		Peter liked the place so much he built a villa, Monplaisir, here and then a whole series of palaces and ornate gardens
			
		after WWII, Peterhof was largely left in ruins. Hitler had intended to throw a party here when his plans to occupy the Astoria Hotel were thwarted. He drew up pompous invitations, which obviously incensed his Soviet foes. Stalin’s response was to pre-empt any such celebration by bombing the estate himself, in the winter of 1941–42, so it is ironic but true that most of the damage at Peterhof occurred at the hands of the Soviets. What you see today is largely a reconstruction; the main palace was completely gutted and only a few of its walls were left standing
		
		all the paintings, furniture and chandeliers are original, as everything was removed from the premises before the Germans arrived in WWII		
		
		don't stress so much about the Peterhof Palace visit. The fountains and parks is what makes the Peterhof exceptional. Visit the Monplaisir Palace and the Bath Block while wandering around the park. It would take good 4 hrs to explore and enjoy. There will be plenty of other palaces to visit, the Catherine's & Hermitage to name a few -  you can skip Peterhof Palace

			you can find marshrutka behind Lenin's statue in Moskovskaya square (metro Moskovskaya, line 2). It takes 45-50 min to get Pushkin. Cost R60. Ask a driver to stop at 'Oranzhereynaya'. Turn right & the Catherine palace in blue & gold

		online booking is a must
			tickets go on sale 14 days before the desired date. It is better to start buying literally at 00:00 of the day when they appear on the site (midnight Moscow time). They are very quickly bought up during the high season. And it is worth bearing in mind that one person can only get 4 tickets
				tickets are released at midnight SPB time, few minutes past, keep refreshing the page. And in most days they get sold out very fast, so one needs to stay awake at exactly that time. Tickets are released and added day by day 14 days in advance,only 100 pcs available online. Just out of curiosity i’ve checked tonight’s opening and the system showed 96 tickets left for the Catherine Palace on June 16 and all was sold out in 6 minutes
					I saw now... and in 1 minute was sold out
					I also conducted an experiment. One minute and everything is sold!
					
				we set our alarm to wake up 5 minutes before midnight St Petersburg time (slightly before 5am where we are), went to the website and kept refreshing the page. Once the tickets appeared about 12.01am, we ordered our tickets. By the time we completed the payment, there were no more tickets for sale. Do note that you can only buy a maximum of 4 tickets per transaction. So if you need more than 4 tickets, you have to purchase them on two computers concurrently. Be on time and keep on refreshing the page. It can be done!				
					when you go to the payment Page the tickets are guaranteed right, they are kept for you in the system for some time to conclude the payment
			
			our Hermitage tour guide said that resellers buy all the tickets bf they go on the website to force ppl to book expensive tours
		
			if you buy online - problem is individual cannot enter before noon with booking
				palace can only be visited by individuals between noon and 2pm, and 4pm and 4.45pm, otherwise it's reserved for pre-booked tour groups, such is its rightful popularity
					we can wait till noon: you can check out Aleksandrovskiy Park next to the Palace. Or you can buy a Catherine park ticket at the Catherine Palace (not expensive, but yes you are double paying for the park entry)
					
			you still need to exchange your online voucher for a real ticket. That is done in a ticket booth near the Church Gate, which is to the side from the central entrance. There are less people than at the central entrance, but still there might be some line. After exchanging your voucher, you enter through the Church Gate
		
		
		you can always buy tickets directly at the ticket office of the palace
			Saturday and Sunday - be ready to find a long line to the palace. Highly recommend you to buy tickets online
			
			queues are EXTREMELY long and there are thousands of tourists (most of them are from Asia of course). Some tourists from Europe describe it as "shambles"... If you get to the palace by the opening hours, the queue is there already (people sitting on small folding chairs) ... so you'd spend HOURS waiting..
			
			be ready to find long line to the palace. If not online, you should buy tickets to enter a palace park, then take a line to the palace & buy the museum tickets inside the palace
			
						
						
		it's not easy to enter Catherine palace without a tour from May to October			

			it's recommended to use tour services, they charge a bit but they guarantee your tour. There is no any better solution
			
			our guides, for what its worth, advised us to go to Pavlovsk Great Palace instead of the Catherine palace because it was more beautiful and better restored			
			
			
		
		tour of the palace takes about 1 hour 
		
		audio guide is a must
		audio guide is well worth taking, as it gives detailed explanation of what you'll see in each room
						
		tour guide
			another thing is to have a half-day tour to Catherine's palace. Not only because of lines but also because of transportation and the palace itself. It has no signs in the rooms. It is meant to be shown by someone. I think without the explanations this particular place is rather empty
		
			Catherin's Palace - this is probably the only one that is better of with a guide (and not because you'll learn more etc but mostly to get you inside quicker, however, this year it's hectic even with a tour/guide). Join one of the many tours. For inst., few booth at the corner of Nevsky prospekt and Dumskaya street (corner of Gostiny Dvor shopping center) have such tours (companies are Davranov, Eclectica-guide etc)
			
			I say only the Catharine's place u need the guide coz of the time widow and save lots of hassle to get in there
			
			Eclectica group tours (cheapest?)

		vast baroque palace, designed by Rastrelli and named after Peter the Great’s second wife. As at the Winter Palace, Catherine the Great had many of Rastrelli’s original interiors remodelled in classical style
			
		interiors are superb, with highlights including the Great Hall, the Arabesque Hall, the baroque Cavalier's Dining Room, the White State Dining Room, the Crimson and Green Pilaster Rooms, the Portrait Hall and, of course, the world-famous Amber Room

		panels used in Amber Room were a gift given to Peter the Great, but not put to any use until 1743 when Elizabeth decided to use them decoratively, after which they were ingeniously incorporated into the walls here. What you see is a reconstruction of the original that disappeared during WWII and is believed to have been destroyed
			original Amber Room was created from exquisitely engraved amber panels given to Peter the Great by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia in 1716. Rastrelli later combined the panels with gilded woodcarvings, mirrors, agate and jasper mosaics to decorate one of the rooms of the Catherine Palace. Plundered by the Nazis during WWII, the room’s decorative panels were last exhibited in Königsberg’s castle in 1941. Four years later, with the castle in ruins, the Amber Room was presumed destroyed
			
			in 2004 Putin and then German Chancellor Gerhardt Schröder presided over the opening of the new US$18 million Amber Room, restored largely with German funds

			emperor Paul I was intensely disliked by his own courtiers, who eventually strangled him with a scarf. However, he had great taste, as displayed in this glorious palace, the finest rooms of which are on the middle floor of the central block
			
			Charles Cameron designed the round Italian Hall beneath the dome and the Grecian Hall to its west. Flanking these are two private suites – Paul’s along the north side of the block and Maria Fyodorovna’s on the south
			
			Hall of War of the military-obsessed Paul contrasts with Maria’s Hall of Peace, decorated with musical instruments and flowers. On the middle floor of the south block are Paul’s Throne Room and the Hall of the Maltese Knights of St John, of whom he was the Grand Master
