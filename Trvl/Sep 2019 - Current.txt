		best value-for-money day trip
		
		online booking is a must
			tickets go on sale 14 days before the desired date. It is better to start buying literally at 00:00 of the day when they appear on the site (midnight Moscow time). They are very quickly bought up during the high season. And it is worth bearing in mind that one person can only get 4 tickets
				tickets are released at midnight SPB time, few minutes past, keep refreshing the page. And in most days they get sold out very fast, so one needs to stay awake at exactly that time. Tickets are released and added day by day 14 days in advance,only 100 pcs available online. Just out of curiosity i’ve checked tonight’s opening and the system showed 96 tickets left for the Catherine Palace on June 16 and all was sold out in 6 minutes
					I saw now... and in 1 minute was sold out
					I also conducted an experiment. One minute and everything is sold!
					
				we set our alarm to wake up 5 minutes before midnight St Petersburg time (slightly before 5am where we are), went to the website and kept refreshing the page. Once the tickets appeared about 12.01am, we ordered our tickets. By the time we completed the payment, there were no more tickets for sale. Do note that you can only buy a maximum of 4 tickets per transaction. So if you need more than 4 tickets, you have to purchase them on two computers concurrently. Be on time and keep on refreshing the page. It can be done!				
					when you go to the payment Page the tickets are guaranteed right, they are kept for you in the system for some time to conclude the payment
			
			our Hermitage tour guide said that resellers buy all the tickets bf they go on the website to force ppl to book expensive tours
		
			if you buy online - problem is individual cannot enter before noon with booking
				palace can only be visited by individuals between noon and 2pm, and 4pm and 4.45pm, otherwise it's reserved for pre-booked tour groups, such is its rightful popularity
					we can wait till noon: you can check out Aleksandrovskiy Park next to the Palace. Or you can buy a Catherine park ticket at the Catherine Palace (not expensive, but yes you are double paying for the park entry)
					
			you still need to exchange your online voucher for a real ticket. That is done in a ticket booth near the Church Gate, which is to the side from the central entrance. There are less people than at the central entrance, but still there might be some line. After exchanging your voucher, you enter through the Church Gate
		
		
		you can always buy tickets directly at the ticket office of the palace
			Saturday and Sunday - be ready to find a long line to the palace. Highly recommend you to buy tickets online
			
			queues are EXTREMELY long and there are thousands of tourists (most of them are from Asia of course). Some tourists from Europe describe it as "shambles"... If you get to the palace by the opening hours, the queue is there already (people sitting on small folding chairs) ... so you'd spend HOURS waiting..
			
			be ready to find long line to the palace. If not online, you should buy tickets to enter a palace park, then take a line to the palace & buy the museum tickets inside the palace
			
						
						
		it's not easy to enter Catherine palace without a tour from May to October			

			it's recommended to use tour services, they charge a bit but they guarantee your tour. There is no any better solution
			
			our guides, for what its worth, advised us to go to Pavlovsk Great Palace instead of the Catherine palace because it was more beautiful and better restored			
			
			
		
		tour of the palace takes about 1 hour 
		
		audio guide is a must
		audio guide is well worth taking, as it gives detailed explanation of what you'll see in each room
						
		tour guide
			another thing is to have a half-day tour to Catherine's palace. Not only because of lines but also because of transportation and the palace itself. It has no signs in the rooms. It is meant to be shown by someone. I think without the explanations this particular place is rather empty
		
			Catherin's Palace - this is probably the only one that is better of with a guide (and not because you'll learn more etc but mostly to get you inside quicker, however, this year it's hectic even with a tour/guide). Join one of the many tours. For inst., few booth at the corner of Nevsky prospekt and Dumskaya street (corner of Gostiny Dvor shopping center) have such tours (companies are Davranov, Eclectica-guide etc)
			
			I say only the Catharine's place u need the guide coz of the time widow and save lots of hassle to get in there
			
			Eclectica group tours (cheapest?)

		vast baroque palace, designed by Rastrelli and named after Peter the Great’s second wife. As at the Winter Palace, Catherine the Great had many of Rastrelli’s original interiors remodelled in classical style
			
		interiors are superb, with highlights including the Great Hall, the Arabesque Hall, the baroque Cavalier's Dining Room, the White State Dining Room, the Crimson and Green Pilaster Rooms, the Portrait Hall and, of course, the world-famous Amber Room

		panels used in Amber Room were a gift given to Peter the Great, but not put to any use until 1743 when Elizabeth decided to use them decoratively, after which they were ingeniously incorporated into the walls here. What you see is a reconstruction of the original that disappeared during WWII and is believed to have been destroyed
			original Amber Room was created from exquisitely engraved amber panels given to Peter the Great by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia in 1716. Rastrelli later combined the panels with gilded woodcarvings, mirrors, agate and jasper mosaics to decorate one of the rooms of the Catherine Palace. Plundered by the Nazis during WWII, the room’s decorative panels were last exhibited in Königsberg’s castle in 1941. Four years later, with the castle in ruins, the Amber Room was presumed destroyed
			
			in 2004 Putin and then German Chancellor Gerhardt Schröder presided over the opening of the new US$18 million Amber Room, restored largely with German funds
