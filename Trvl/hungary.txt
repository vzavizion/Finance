			The bathes are located in a historical building in downtown Székesfehérvár.
			Facilities are well maintained, nice looking interior and clean bathes for your convenience. You will have your own dressing booth once you bought your tickets, so you can have your belongings in a separated little room, and have some privacy for changing clothes. The building is not as big as a water entertainment park, and please do not expect slides and wave pools. These are traditional Turkish bathes in good shape.

			Both indoor as well as outdoor parts look obsolete and would require total refurbishment. Cleanliness of facilities was on very low level. Total indoor area is quite small and was desperately overcrowded plus there was strange unpleasant stink during visit of me and my two children.
			The spa is built more the 10 years ago and nothing modernization and innovation in the last 10 years.
			The stuffs was so rude and unpolite.

		    Visitors should be aware that this region produces mainly (excellent) red wines
			probably the best red wine region of Hungary. Its signature wine, the "Kopár Cuvee" is real world class wine. 	
			
			Sauska Winery Villany:

			Not only.can i recomend this place but viallany village itself is full of wine cellars, one after the other, where you can sample the local wine and believe me, it isvery very good
	
			Gere Attila Pinceszete- Winery:

					lots of people carrying large empty plastic containers to buy wine out of barrel which is cheap but not the best quality					
					if you walk past the cellars and up the hill you will find some vineyards if you are interested to see them and looking for photo ops
					wine sold for far more than it can be bought for elsewhere. Poor service. Exists to bilk un-suspecting tourists into buying over-rated cheap plonk
