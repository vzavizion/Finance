						?Platja de Vallpresona
						
							!?Cala del Senyor Ramon:
								Nudist beach with crystal clear waters, a calm place ...
								We arrived at 4.30 in the afternoon and we were approached by a man quite bordering and unpleasant to tell us that the parking is 6-8 euros and that at 7 we have to go
								t is a wide and beautiful beach although with danger of landslides. Above the road, it indicates Can Rigau and the beach of La Corcullada. If you leave the car next to the road, for about 6-7 cars you will save 6 euros of parking that will charge you. 4 for motorcycles. You must walk about 10 minutes along a sloping dirt road.
								after leaving the car you have to walk almost a kilometer to get to the beach.
								Nudist beach CARE STEAL IN THE CARS
								Пляж частично нудистский, но людей не много и виды потрясающие. Были с ребёнком 7 лет и из близлежащих пляжей понравился больше всего этот. Мелкая галька сильно нагревается и ходить по ней в жару невозможно - лучше спец обувь.
								You can park by car near the beach for a fee of about 6-8 € (close the gate in the evening), or upstairs by the road is free. You can walk down for about 20-30 minutes.
								The beach is 90% naturist
							!?cala pola:
								€ 18 парковка кемпинга. Вы также можете бесплатно припарковаться недалеко от места разбивки лагеря, но нам посоветовали, что машины обычно открыты для угона.
								The campsite is horrible with smell of sewage! The campsite these monopolized this beach and is used as a boat parking !!!! Not to mention the number of people on the beach, one stick to the others, however the water is crystalline but with a diving mask you can see some fish and also some garbage in the bottom, the damage that this paradise becomes a dump!
								people that are there are mainly from the campsite
							!?Cala Giverola:
								Crowded
								Dirty water
								Очень хорошая бухта с множеством рыбы и очень чистой водой, а также с пляжным баром с хорошей пиццей. Плохо то, что он полон камней.
								Water shoes
								Although the water there was colder than for example at Cala Llevado or Tossa de Mar itself. Will be due to currents
								Nice cove but parking too expensive for a swim, (13 €).
								Super equipped with shower, sunbeds and umbrellas to rent, canoes, pedal boats, restaurants 
								Большое количество отдыхающих, пленка на воде от предохраняющих кремов, спреев и масел, неприятное каменистое дно, острые скользкие камни
								There is a vacation resort nearby

								Sant Joan funicular rises steeply to the hermitage of Sant Joan, from where it’s a tougher 45-minute walk to the Sant Jeroni hermitage, and another fifteen minutes to the Sant Jeroni summit at 1236m (along a path marked with some blobs of yellow paint)
