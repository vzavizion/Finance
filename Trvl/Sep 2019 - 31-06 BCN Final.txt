				buy T-10 (“tay day-oo” in Catalan) costs €10.20, and is valid for ten separate journeys
					purchase at the entrance to any metro station
						it's a good idea to have change as well as notes because some entrances are unmanned and have automated ticket machines. Some of these automated ticket machines will only accept change
					
					once you've purchased your T10 ticket and want to use the metro you have to put the ticket into a ticket validation machine at the metro entrance. The machine checks the ticket and then marks it on the back with a printed day and time stamp. You then have to pull the ticket out of the machine slot and in that instant the turnstile lock is released and you can pass through
					
					can be used by more than one person at a time – just feed it through the barrier for each person travelling (just make sure you punch it the same number of times as there are people travelling)
						in order for each person in your group to use the same T10 you have to put the card in the ticket validation machine and then pull it out completely - this will open the sliding doors to allow you to pass through. Leave the card on the machine surface however for the next member of your group to use the T10. Each time someone in your group uses the T10 it counts as a separate journey and the journeys are printed on the back of the ticket during validation
					
					each time you use the T10 ticket you will see how many journeys you have left on the LCD display of the ticket validation machine

Great snacks and a good selection of soft drinks and alcohol. There is even a spa inside for some pampering. If you have children, there is a good selection of juice, milk, and crackers.


The lounge has been refurbished recently and looks now more sexy and is certainly more comfortable. I like the extensive collection of Spanish wines and cava but the food quality could be better.

Outstanding
Renovated in April 2019, nice chairs, a quiet room and a spa. Same food as before - with meal times on Spanish schedule (dinner starts at 19:30).

They must have done a complete renovation since these last reviews because this is one of the nicer lounges in Europe I've been to. 
Couches and chairs were clean, modern, and the place was pleasantly lit. Large selection of bottled beers, soft drinks, liquor, you name it. Throw in cold cuts, cookies/crackers, yogurt, coffee, etc.
