Mosteiro dos Jerónimos 
	Dom Manuel I’s fantastical tribute to the great explorers of the 15th century
		Manuel I commissioned it to trumpet Vasco da Gama’s discovery of a sea route to India in 1498
		
	Jerónimos was once populated by monks of the Order of St Jerome, whose spiritual job for four centuries was to comfort sailors and pray for the king’s soul. When the order was dissolved in 1833, the monastery was used as a school and orphanage until about 1940

	entering the church through the western portal, you’ll notice tree-trunk-like columns that seem to grow into the ceiling, which is itself a spiderweb of stone. Windows cast a soft golden light over the church. Superstar Vasco da Gama is interred in the lower chancel, just left of the entrance, opposite venerated 16th-century poet Luís Vaz de Camões. From the upper choir, there’s a superb view of the church; the rows of seats are Portugal’s first Renaissance woodcarvings
	
	there’s nothing like the moment you walk into the honey-stone Manueline cloisters, dripping with organic detail in their delicately scalloped arches, twisting auger-shell turrets and columns intertwined with leaves, vines and knots. It will simply wow. Keep an eye out for symbols of the age such as the armillary sphere and the cross of the Military Order, plus gargoyles and fantastical beasties on the upper balustrade

Palácio de BelémHISTORIC BUILDING
(Belém Palace; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 614 660; www.presidencia.pt; Praça Afonso de Albuquerque; €5/free; h10am-6pm Sat)
The salmon-slabbed 16th-century Belém Palace is Portugal's official presidential residence (though the country's last president, Cavaco Silva, chose to live in his own home) and office. Tours in Portuguese, English and French are available on Saturday only, with just 150 spots up for grabs (book in advance via email). Alternatively, a small but fascinating museum is open throughout the week.

Jardim Botânico TropicalGARDENS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www2.iict.pt; Largo dos Jerónimos; adult/child €2/1; h10am-8pm May-Aug, shorter hours in winter)
Far from the madding crowd, these botanical gardens bristle with hundreds of tropical species from date palms to monkey puzzle trees. Spread across 7 hectares, it’s a peaceful, shady retreat on a sweltering summer’s day. A highlight is the Macau garden, complete with minipagoda, where bamboo rustles and a cool stream trickles.

Padrão dos DescobrimentosMUSEUM
(Discoveries Monument; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.padraodosdescobrimentos.pt; Av de Brasília; adult/child €4/2; h10am-7pm, to 6pm Oct-Feb)
Like a caravel frozen in midswell, the monolithic Padrão dos Descobrimentos was inaugurated in 1960 on the 500th anniversary of Henry the Navigator’s death. The 56m-high limestone giant is chock-full of Portuguese bigwigs. At the prow is Henry, while behind him are explorers Vasco da Gama, Diogo Cão, Fernão de Magalhães (Ferdinand Magellan) and 29 other greats.
Do take the lift (or puff up 267 steps) to the windswept miradouro for 360-degree views over the river. The mosaic in front of the monument charts the routes of Portuguese mariners.
Museu de MarinhaMUSEUM
(Naval Museum; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.museu.marinha.pt; Praça do Império; adult/child €6.50/free, free 1st Sun of month; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun, to 5pm Oct-Apr)
The Museu de Marinha is a nautical flashback to the Age of Discoveries with its armadas of model ships, cannonballs and shipwreck booty. Dig for buried treasure like Vasco da Gama’s portable wooden altar, 17th-century globes (note Australia’s absence) and the polished private quarters of UK-built royal yacht Amélia. A separate building houses royal barges, 19th-century firefighting machines and seaplanes.
GREAT ESCAPES
Some of Lisbon’s greenest and most peaceful praças (town squares) are perfect for a crowd-free stroll or picnic. A few of our favourites:
Praça da Alegria Swooping palms and banyan trees shade tranquil Praça da Alegria, which is actually more round than square. Look out for the bronze bust of 19th-century Portuguese painter and composer Alfredo Keil.
Praça do Príncipe Real A century-old cedar tree forms a giant natural parasol at the centre of this palm-dotted square, popular among grizzled card players by day and gay cruisers by night. There’s a kids' playground and a relaxed cafe with alfresco seating.
Praça das Flores Centred on a fountain, this romantic, leafy square has cobbles, pastel-washed houses and enough doggie-do to make a Parisian proud.
Campo dos Mártires da Pátria Framed by elegant buildings, this grassy square is dotted with pine, weeping willow and jacaranda trees, with a pond for ducks and a pleasant indoor-outdoor cafe. Lisboêtas in search of cures light candles before the statue of Dr Sousa Martins, who was renowned for his healing work among the poor.
Parque das Nações
A shining model of urban regeneration, Parque das Nações has almost single-handedly propelled the city into the 21st century since Expo '98. Here you'll find an impressive aquarium, riverside gardens, public-art installations, and outdoor dining options galore.
To reach Parque das Nações, take the train or metro to Gare do Oriente and follow the signs to the waterfront. The riverside promenade is great for two-wheel adventures. To rent your own set of wheels, there are well-worn bikes at the reception of Marina Parque das Nações ( GOOGLE MAP ; %218 949 066; www.marinaparquedasnacoes.pt; bike hire per 1/4/8hr €5/10/12; h9am-9pm, to 7pm Oct-Apr) or head to Ring-A-Bike ( GOOGLE MAP ; %964 442 027; www.ringabike.pt; Rua do Armistício 24, Moscavide; bike hire 1-/4-/8hr from €5/10/20; h9am-8.30pm Wed-Mon), 1.6km northwest of Parque das Nações in Moscavide. For a bird’s-eye view of the park, take a ride on the Teleférico (Telecabine Lisboa; GOOGLE MAP ; www.telecabinelisboa.pt; Passeio do Tejo; 1-way adult/child €3.95/2; h10.30am-8pm, 11am-7pm off season), which glides above the river’s edge.
OceanárioAQUARIUM
( GOOGLE MAP ; www.oceanario.pt; Doca dos Olivais; adult/child €14/9, incl temporary exhibition €17/11; h10am-8pm, to 7pm winter)
The closest you’ll get to scuba diving without a wetsuit, Lisbon’s Oceanário is mind-blowing. No amount of hyperbole, where 8000 marine creatures splash in 7 million litres of seawater, does it justice. Huge wrap-around tanks make you feel as if you are underwater, as you eyeball zebra sharks, honeycombed rays, gliding mantas and schools of neon fish.
Pavilhão do ConhecimentoMUSEUM
(Pavilion of Knowledge; GOOGLE MAP ; www.pavconhecimento.pt; Living Science Centre; adult/child €9/5; h10am-6pm Tue-Fri, 11am-7pm Sat & Sun)
Kids won’t grumble about science at the interactive Pavilhão do Conhecimento, where they can experience the gravity on the moon (or lack thereof, rather) and get dizzy on a high-wire bicycle. Budding physicists have fun whipping up tornadoes and blowing massive soap bubbles, while tots run riot in the adult-free unfinished house.
Gare do OrienteNOTABLE BUILDING
(Oriente Station; GOOGLE MAP ; Av Dom João II)
Designed by acclaimed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the space-age Gare do Oriente is an extraordinary vaulted structure, with slender columns fanning out into a concertina roof to create a kind of geometric, crystalline forest.
SAINTLY CELEBRATIONS

Come all ye faithful lovers of vinho-swigging, sardine-feasting, dancing and merrymaking to June’s Festas dos Santos Populares (Festivals of the Popular Saints), three weeks of midsummer madness. In Lisbon, the key saintly festivities are:
Festa de Santo António (Festival of St Anthony) This lively fest is celebrated with particular fervour in Alfama and Madragoa from 12 to 13 June, with feasting, drinking, bailes (balls) and some 50 arraiais (street parties). St Anthony has a bit of a reputation as a matchmaker. Lisboêtas declare their undying love by giving manjericos (basil plants) with soppy poems. Around 300 hard-up couples get hitched for free!
Festa de São Pedro (Festival of St Peter) Lisbon pulls out all the stops for St Peter, the patron saint of fisher folk, from 28 to 29 June. There are slap-up seafood dinners and river processions in his barnacled honour.

5Eating
Creative new-generation chefs at the stove, first-rate raw ingredients and a generous pinch of world spice has transformed Lisbon into a buzzing culinary capital. Reservations, even early in the week and in off-season, are a good idea – getting turned away without them is all too common.
Baixa & Rossio
Many of Baixa’s old-school bistros and outdoor cafes heave with tourists, but tiptoe away from the main drag, Rua Augusta, and you’ll find some gems in streets such as Rua dos Correiros and Rua dos Sapateiros.
oMercado da BaixaMARKET€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.adbaixapombalina.pt; Praça da Figueira; h10am-10pm Fri-Sun)
This tented market/glorious food court on Praça da Figueira has been slinging cheese, wine, smoked sausages and other gourmet goodies since 1855. It takes place on the last weekend of each month and it is fantastic fun to stroll the stalls eating and drinking yourself into a gluttonous mess.
Nova PombalinaPORTUGUESE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/anovapombalina; Rua do Comércio 2; sandwiches €2.20-4; h7am-7.30pm, closed Sun)
The reason this bustling traditional restaurant is always packed around midday is its delicious leitão (suckling pig) sandwich, served on freshly baked bread in 60 seconds or less by the lightning-fast crew behind the counter.
Tasca KomeJAPANESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %211 340 117; www.kome-lisboa.com; Rua da Madalena 57; mains €7-15, sushi plates from €15; hnoon-2.30pm & 7-10pm Mon-Thu, noon-3pm & 7-10pm Fri, 12.30-3pm & 7-10pm Sat; W)
This blink-and-you'll-miss-it Japanese tasca is one of Lisbon's few turning out authentic cuisine from the Land of the Rising Sun. The menu doesn't overwhelm with options; instead, there's exquisite sushi, tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlets), shime saba (mackerel ceviche), slow-cooked pork belly and the like (eggplant bolognese for vegetarians), all nicely washed down with sake or mugi-cha (roasted barley tea).
BebedouroTAPAS€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %218 860 376; www.facebook.com/bebedourowineandfood; Rua de São Nicolau 24; €4-13; hnoon-11.45pm, closed Tue; W)
Wine-bottle lights illuminate stylish Bebedouro, where full-bodied Douro wines are nicely paired with tasting platters of regional cheese and sausage, creative salads and petiscos (tapas or small plates). The small, shotgun-style place has just five tables and five bar seats plus a little pavement terrace.
BonjardimPORTUGUESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 424 389; Travessa de Santo Antão 11; roast chicken for 2 €13.50; hnoon-11pm, closed Wed & Thu lunch)
Juicy, spit-roast frango (chicken) is served with a mountain of fries at this no-frills joint. Add piri-piri (hot sauce) for extra spice. The pavement terrace is elbow-to-elbow in summer.
Casa do AlentejoPORTUGUESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.casadoalentejo.com.pt; Rua Portas de Santo Antão 58; mains €11-14; hlunch & dinner Mon-Sat; W)
Hidden behind a plain facade, the Casa do Alentejo has a museum-quality, Moorish-style interior that some say is even more impressive than the food – pork with clams, lamb stew and other Alentejan favourites served upstairs in two palatial 17th-century tile-filled dining rooms. The changing €8 lunch specials are good value.
oCervejaria RamiroSEAFOOD€€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cervejariaramiro.pt; Av Almirante Reis 1; seafood per kg around €11.73-89.25; hnoon-12.30am Tue-Sun)
Opened in 1956, Ramiro has legendary status among Lisbon's seafood lovers. Here you can feast on rich plates of giant tiger prawns, percebes (goose barnacles), lobster, crab and clams – and a juicy steak sandwich for nonpescatarians. Despite the high prices, the atmosphere is bustling and informal, with garrulous crowds quaffing more beer than wine.
Ramiro doesn't take reservations after 7.30pm, so arrive early and prepare to queue.
Solar dos PresuntosPORTUGUESE€€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 424 253; www.solardospresuntos.com; Rua das Portas de Santo Antão 150; mains €16-27.50, seafood per kg €29-70; h12.30-3.30pm & 7-11pm Mon-Sat; W)
Don’t be fooled by the smoked presunto (ham) hanging in the window, this iconic restaurant is renowned for its excellent seafood too. Start with the excellent pata negra (cured ham), paio smoked sausage and cheese couvert (stew), then dig into a fantastic lobster açorda (nibbles), delectable seafood paella or crustacean curry. Go easy on their homespun piri-piri – it bites back!
Chiado & Cais do Sodré
oMercado da RibeiraMARKET€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.timeoutmarket.com; Av 24 de Julho; h10am-midnight Sun-Wed, to 2am Thu-Sat; W)
Doing trade in fresh fruit and veg, fish and flowers since 1892, this oriental-dome-topped market hall is the word on everyone's lips since Time Out transformed half of it into a gourmet food court in 2014. Now it's like Lisbon in microcosm, with everything from Garrafeira Nacional wines to Conserveira de Lisboa fish, Arcádia chocolate and Santini gelato.
Follow the lead of locals and come for a browse in the morning followed by lunch at one of 35 kiosks – there's everything from Café de São Bento's famous steak and fries to a stand by top-chef Henrique Sá Pessoa. Do not miss it.
LandeauSWEETS€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.landeau.pt; Rua das Flores 70; cake €3.50; hnoon-7pm; W)
The Portuguese love to self-proclaim (by name, no less!) their product to be the Best This or the Best That in the World, but this don't-miss cafe puts its chocolate where its mouth is, serving up as flawless a piece of chocolate cake as you'll ever encounter.
Gelato DavveroICE CREAM€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.gelatodavvero.com; Praça São Paulo 1; mini/medium/large €1.50/2.50/3.50; h12.45-8pm Sun & Tue-Thu, to midnight Fri-Sat; W)
Owner Filippo Licitra defected from Lisbon's Gelataria Nannarella after a divorce. His rival gelataria, Davvero, boasts 35 flavours on the board, so there's room for wackiness (avocado, salmon, curried mango), but the creamilicious classics are all here. Take a seat on the striking stacked-hardwood booths and don't forget to top it with the delicious in-house whipped cream. When in Rome!
O TrevoPORTUGUESE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Praça Luís de Camões 48; snacks €0.80-2.50; h7am-10pm Mon-Sat)
Despite a posh address on Praça Luís de Camões, O Trevo is a bustling and surly local joint deeply rooted in the daily grind. Working-class Lisbon bellies up to the counter for bifanas – thinly sliced pork, precooked in boiling seasoned lard and slapped on the griddle, then served between two slices of warmed biju bread with mustard and/or chilli oil.
Pistola y CorazonMEXICAN€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.pistolaycorazon.com; Rua da Boavista 16; tacos €6.50-7; hnoon-3pm & 6pm-midnight Mon-Fri, 6pm-midnight Sat-Sun; W)
This lively hipster taquería (taco stand) is a Godsend of authentic Mexican street tacos (carnitas, cochinita pibil, carne asada, al pastor etc, served in sets of three), served among tweaked El Tri kitsch (Frida Kahlo rocking a Daft Punk T-shirt!). The creative mescal- and tequila-laced cocktail list is equally outstanding. Write your name on the wait list – it's always packed.
Sol e PescaPORTUGUESE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.solepesca.com; Rua Nova do Carvalho 44; tinned fish €3-5; hnoon-2am Sun-Thu, to 3am Fri-Sat)
Rods, nets, hooks and fish charts give away this tiny bar's former life as a fishing-tackle shop. Cabinets are stacked with vintage-looking tins of sardines, tuna, mackerel and other preserved delicacies. Grab a chair, order a tin or two, and accompany it with bread, olives and wine, and you have the makings of a fine and quite affordable meal.
PovoPORTUGUESE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.povolisboa.com; Rua Nova do Carvalho 32; small plates €7-11; h6pm-2am Mon-Wed & Sun, to 4am Thu-Sat)
On bar-lined Rua Nova do Carvalho, Povo serves tasty Portuguese comfort food in the form of petiscos. There's also outdoor seating, plus live performances a few times per week from in-house fadista Marta de Sousa (Thursdays are best; from 9.30pm).
Cafe TatiCAFE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 461 279; www.cafetati.blogspot.com; Rua da Ribeira Nova 36; mains €7-8; h11am-1am Tue-Sun; W)
Cafe Tati has bohemian charm amid its smattering of well-lit stone-arched rooms with stencilled walls. Along with inventive tibornas (elaborate Portuguese-style bruschetta with toppings such as presunto dry-cured ham, green apple and brie) and salads (marinated tuna with sesame seeds and capers), there are appetising daily specials.
Cantina das FreitasPORTUGUESE€
(ACISJF; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.juntanacionalacisjf.blogspot.pt; Travessa do Ferragial 1, top fl; mains €7; hnoon-3pm Mon-Fri)
Sweet nuns dressed as lunch ladies run this small, sunny cafeteria inside a Catholic association, dishing up a daily soup (the gazpacho is great!), several mains – of the beef, sardines or codfish variety – and fresh fruit for dessert. The river views from the sun-drenched terrace are astounding.
BrioSUPERMARKET€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.brio.pt; Travessa do Carmo 1; h9am-8pm Mon-Fri, 10am-8pm Sat, noon-7pm Sun)
If you're self-catering or simply after a picnic, this organic, reasonably priced grocer stocks the essentials: wines, yoghurts, granolas, cold drinks, chocolates, cheeses, breads and more. There's also a small cafe with outdoor tables in front.
Mini BarFUSION€€

Trendy and fun, Mini Bar is the most approachable and hippest entry point into the innovative cuisine of Michelin-starred chef José Avillez, who has several restaurants in the vicinity. Billed as a gourmet bar amid theatre-inspired decor, it's a trendy mash-up of nightlife and fine dining, where you'll enjoy exceptional craft drinking alongside small, chef-driven petiscos.
Palácio ChiadoGASTRONOMY€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.palaciochiado.pt; Rua do Alecrim 70; mains €7-28; hnoon-midnight Sun-Wed, to 2am Thu-Sat; W)
The ravishing former home of Portuguese barons and French generals is Lisbon's stunning new address for foodies, a gourmet-food court wrapped in exquisitely renovated 18th-century packaging. A breathtaking grand staircase, swamped by original stained glass and archetypal frescoes, invites you to explore seven gastronomic concepts spread over two floors, from burgers and grills to sparkling wine and seafood.
Taberna ToscaTAPAS€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %218 034 563; www.tabernatosca.com; Praça São Paulo 21; tapas €7-15.50; hnoon-midnight)
A peaceful retreat from nearby Rua Nova do Carvalho mayhem, Tosca is an enticing spot for Portuguese tapas and bold Douro reds (but don't be afraid to spring for a pitcher of fabulous port sangria). Open-air seating is on leafy Praça São Paulo in front, opposite an 18th-century church, making it feel like a hidden Lisbon highlight.
Vicente by CarnalentejanaPORTUGUESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %218 237 126; www.restaurantecarnalentejana.com; Rua das Flores 6; mains €9-14; hnoon-11pm; W)
This sexy newcomer dishes up succulent beef and pork dishes made with ultra-premium Carnalentejana DOP-certified meat from the Alentejo along with wines, cheeses, olive oils and other treats produced by the same artisan farmers. A former coal shop turned carnivore's den of decadence, the original low-slung stone walls, exposed air ducts and filament light bulbs are notably atmospheric.
SacramentoPORTUGUESE, MEDITERRANEAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 420 572; www.sacramentodochiado.com; Calçada Sacramento 40; mains €13-38.50; hnoon-3pm & 7.30pm-midnight; W)
If you drop your céntimos at one touristy restaurant in Lisbon, choose contemporary Sacramento, a fun and festive restaurant gorgeously set inside a 17th-century former palace. Both the decor (soothing maroon and chocolate-framed mirrors and suspended red luminaires spread among several rooms) and the food (lovely wild mushrooms with presunto, a perfectly charred octopus à lagareiro) are real crowd-pleasers.
QueijariaCHEESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.queijaria.wix.com/queijaria; Rua das Flores 64; 1/3/5 cheese tasting €4.70/11.70/14.70; h1-10pm Tue-Fri, from noon Sat-Sun; W)
What started as Lisbon's only dedicated cheese shop has evolved into a fantastic place to sample top homespun cheeses from small regional producers otherwise inaccessible in the capital. Plop yourself down for a creamy, barnyardy five-cheese plate paired with wines or craft beer (serves two; €42.50 to €47.50). No regrets!
Sala de CorteSTEAK€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 460 030; www.saladecorte.pt; Rua da Ribeira Nova 28; steaks €11.50-29; hnoon-3pm & 7pm-midnight Mon-Fri, noon-midnight Sat-Sun; W)
The not-to-be-missed 'cut room' in Cais do Sodré dishes out succulent, perfectly seasoned imported beef in six cuts (entrecôte, picanha, sirloin, chateaubriand etc), which are chargrilled in a small, world-class Josper grill/oven hybrid, then prepped and beautifully presented on wooden planks in an intimate open kitchen. When you're sick of seafood, run here – but not without a reservation!
Taberna da Rua das FloresPORTUGUESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 479 418; Rua das Flores 103; small plates €2.50-14; hnoon-midnight Mon-Fri, 6pm-midnight Sat)S
You'll have to get past the owner's unfortunate 'My way or the highway' attitude, but if you do, this tiny throwback tavern does a daily-changing, locally sourced chalkboard menu of creative small plates, all market-fresh and fantastic. Sweet staff offer in-depth, mouth-watering descriptions for each dish, which are chased with Lisbon-area-only wines and select cocktails mixed with hardcore Portuguese firewaters.
MercantinaPIZZA€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %231 070 013; www.mercantina.pt; Rua da Misericórdia 114; pizza €8.70-14, pasta €10.80-13.40; hnoon-3.30pm & 7.30-11.30pm Mon-Thu, noon-3.30pm & 7pm-midnight Fri, 12.30-3.30pm & 7pm-midnight Sat, 12.30-3.30pm & 7-11.30pm Sun; W)
You'll find Lisbon's best pizza – uncut, certified by Napoli's strict Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana – at this cosy Chiado hotspot whose hardwood-heavy decor vaguely approaches ski-lodge territory. The spicy diavola (tomato, mozzarella, ventricina, Parmesan and basil) and mercantina (tomato, mozzarella, ham, salami, mushrooms and Parmesan) are both showstoppers, but don't discount the phenomenal lasagne. Reserve ahead online.
FábulasCAFE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.fabulas.pt; Calçada Nova de São Francisco 14; mains €9-16; h10am-midnight, to 1am Fri-Sat; Wv)
Inside, exposed stone walls, soft lighting, vaulted ceilings and twisting corridors that open onto cosy nooks do indeed conjure a fábula (storybook fable). Vintage armchairs and sofas are fine spots for a snack, drink or classic dishes such as black-pork cheeks. Outside, there's a divine drinking patio for warm weather. Either way, the vibe is delightfully mellow.
Casa de PastoPORTUGUESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %963 739 979; www.casadepasto.com; Rua do São Paulo 20, 1st fl; mains €10-22; h12.30-3pm & 6-11pm Mon-Wed, to midnight Thu-Sat; W)
Up the stairs behind a not-very-triumphant facade lays this surprising treasure trove of 19th-century Portuguese bric-a-brac – seashell nightlights, ceramic taxidermy, gaudy mirrors – which fascinate while Diogo Noronha, a former Per Se intern and one of Lisbon's top upstart chefs, does decidedly delightful things with his charcoal oven. The tuna? The pork cheeks? The grilled veggies? Perfect.
CarmoPORTUGUESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 460 088; www.restaurantecarmo.com; Largo do Carmo 10; mains €11-16, 3-course lunch €12; h9.30am-midnight, closed Tue; W)
On picturesque Largo do Carmo, this fan favourite is solid for elegantly presented Portuguese classics (monkfish rice, bacalhau à Brás) but not without somewhat rarer surprises (cuttlefish feijoada stew, Mirandela-style alheira pork sausage), all served under ornate ceilings and chandeliers. The best seats in the house are the window nooks with views across the plaza to Convento do Carmo.
KaffeehausCAFE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kaffeehaus-lisboa.com; Rua Anchieta 3; mains €5.50-17, Sun brunch €8.50-12; hnoon-midnight Tue-Sat, to 8pm Sun)
Kaffeehaus has a bright interior with classic lines and big windows overlooking a peaceful corner of the Chiado, and it’s a favourite eating and drinking spot among a cool but unpretentious crowd. Check the chalkboard for daily specials, including big salads, tasty schnitzels and sausages, strudels, cakes and more. Expect big crowds (and great food) at weekend brunches.
oAlmaCONTEMPORARY, PORTUGUESE€€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 470 650; www.almalisboa.pt; Rua Anchieta 15; mains €25-29, tasting menus €60-80; hnoon-3pm & 7-11pm Tue-Sun; W)
Henrique Sá Pessoa, one of Portugal's most talented chefs, moved his flagship Alma from Santos to more fitting digs in Chiado in 2015. The casual space exudes understated style amid its original stone flooring and gorgeous hardwood tables, but it's Pessoa's outrageously good nouveau Portuguese cuisine that draws the foodie flock from far and wide.
oBelcantoPORTUGUESE€€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 420 607; www.belcanto.pt; Largo de São Carlos 10; mains €45, tasting menu €125-145, with 5/7 wines €50/60; h12.30-3pm & 7.30-11pm Tue-Sat; W)
Fresh off a 2016 intimacy upgrade, José Avillez' two-Michelin-starred cathedral of cookery wows diners with painstaking creativity, polished service and first-rate sommelier. Standouts among Lisbon's culinary adventure of a lifetime include suckling pig with orange purée, sea bass with seaweed and bivalves and a stunning roasted butternut squash with miso; paired wines sometimes date to the '70s! Reservations essential.
Bistro 100 ManeirasFUSION€€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %910 307 575; www.restaurante100maneiras.com; Largo da Trindade 9; mains €17-33; h7.30pm-2am Mon-Sat; W)
The Bosnian mastermind behind Bairro Alto's 100 Maneiras also oversees this creatively charged Chiado bistro. Start with the namesake 100 Maneiras Strong cocktail in the beautiful downstairs bar, then head upstairs for beautifully prepared dishes showcasing high-end Portuguese ingredients. Classics such as truffled mushroom risotto with wild shrimp are astounding; and options for braver souls include lamb brains.
Bairro Alto & Santa Catarina
ManteigariaPATISSERIE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.pt-br.facebook.com/manteigariacamoes; Rua do Loreto 2; pastel de nata €1; h8am-midnight)
Baking pastéis de nata really is rocket science in Lisbon. But this born-again butter factory gets it just right – crisp tarts that flake just so are filled with luscious cream and served with good strong coffee and smiles at this bright and tight modern cafe. This isn't Lisbon's most famous pastel de nata, but some say it's the best.
A Cultura do HamburgerCAFE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/aculturadohamburguer; Rua das Salgadeiras 38; burgers €6-9; hnoon-3.30pm & 6pm-midnight Mon-Fri, noon-4pm & 6.30pm-midnight Sat-Sun; W)
In what is surely a legendary culinary coup, the owners of A Cultura do Chá woke up one morning and flipped the script. A Cultura do Hamburger was born in the same quiet Bairro Alto nook, with no tea in sight. Instead, some of Lisbon's most perfectly charred burgers emerge among these stone walls and arches and reclaimed-door tables.
IscoSEAFOOD€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 461 376; www.restauranteisco.pt; Rua do Almada 29; small plates €7.50-12; h12.30pm-12.30am Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri-Sat; W)
Take a number (like at the deli counter) and prepare to wait at this Bica newcomer, a trendy and tasty maritime-themed hotspot dishing out daily-changing seafood petiscos to a fun and festive crowd. Fish tacos with mango salsa, cod and sweet-potato crisps, fresh ceviche – it's a catch-of-the-day free-for-all that doesn't disappoint.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 462 146; www.chef-felicidade.pt; Rua Marechal Saldanha 2; tapas €4.50-16; h1pm-1am Tue-Sun; W)
In Lisbon's apothecary museum, chef Susana Felicidade (Algarvian grandmother-trained!) dispenses tasting menus and tapas singing with flavours that are both market-fresh and Mediterranean influenced at this wonderfully quirky restaurant. Appetisers served in test tubes, and cabinets brimming with pill bottles and flacons – it's all part of the pharmaceutical fun. The terrace is a great spot for cocktails.
Flor da LaranjaMOROCCAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %964 781 122; Rua da Rosa 206; mains €14-16; h7-11.30pm Mon-Sat; W)
Casablanca native Rabea Esserghini runs a one-woman show at the wonderful Flor da Laranja, which means service is slow, but the cosy North African ambience and delicious Moroccan cuisine more than make up for it. Top picks include dolmas, mouth-watering couscous dishes, lamb, shrimp and veggie tagines, chicken with lemon confit and fresh berry crêpes for dessert.
DecadentePORTUGUESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 461 381; www.thedecadente.pt; Rua de São Pedro de Alcântara 81; mains €9-16; hnoon-11pm Sun-Wed, to midnight Thu-Sat; W)
This beautifully designed restaurant inside a boutique hotel overlooking the stunning São Pedro de Alcântara lookout, with touches of industrial chic, geometric artwork and an enticing back patio, serves inventive dishes showcasing high-end Portuguese ingredients at excellent prices. The changing three-course lunch menu (€10) is first-rate. Start with creative cocktails in the front bar.
Zé VaruncaPORTUGUESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %210 151 279; www.zevarunca.com; Travessa das Mercês 16; mains €8.50-14.50; hnoon-3pm & 7-11pm Mon-Sat; W)
Fans of this small Alentejan icon were aghast when it disappeared from Lisbon's foodie map in 2015. Thankfully, Zé resurfaced a year later in improved Bairro Alto digs. Regional classics (cozido de grão, a chickpea and meat stew; bread-based cod dish migas de bacalhau) and products lugged from Estremoz incite riotous delight – appalling service is immediately forgiven. Reservations essential.
Jardim dos SentidosVEGETARIAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 423 670; www.jardimdosentidos.com; Rua Mãe d’Água 3; mains €8.50-9.50, lunch buffet €8.90; hnoon-3pm & 7-10pm Mon-Fri, 7-10.30pm Sat; Wv)
Vegetarian-minded diners flock to this attractive restaurant and wellness centre with a back garden/spa, an extensive lunch buffet and à la carte dinners. Among the globally inspired vegetarian offerings: four-cheese lasagne, vegetarian chilli, warm goat’s-cheese salad and stuffed eggplant, plus a substantial tea menu.

How do we love 100 Maneiras? Let us count the 100 ways… The nine-course tasting menu changes twice yearly and features imaginative, delicately prepared dishes. The courses are all a surprise – part of the charm – though somewhat disappointingly, the chef will only budge so far to accommodate special diets and food allergies. Reservations are essential for the elegant and small space.
Alfama, Castelo & Graça
oTi-NatérciaPORTUGUESE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %218 862 133; Rua Escola Gerais 54; mains €5-12; h7pm-midnight Mon-Fri, noon-3pm & 7pm-midnight Sat)
A decade in and a legend in the making, 'Aunt' Natércia and her downright delicious Portuguese home cooking is a tough ticket: there are but a mere six tables and they fill up fast. She'll talk your ear off (and doesn't mince words!) while you devour her excellent take on the classics. Reservations essential (and cash only).
Pois CaféCAFE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.poiscafe.com; Rua de São João da Praça 93; mains €7-10; hnoon-11pm Mon, 10am-11pm Tue-Sun; W)
Boasting a laid-back vibe under dominant stone arches, atmospheric Pois Café has creative salads, sandwiches and fresh juices, plus a handful of heartier daily specials (salmon quiche, sirloin steak). Its sofas invite lazy afternoons spent reading novels and sipping coffee, but you'll fight for space with the laptop brigade.
Princesa do CasteloCAFE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua do Salvador 64A; snacks €1.50-5, mains €8.50; hnoon-midnight Tue-Sun; Wv)S
This bright and chirpy vegetarian cafe positively radiates good health with vegetarian, vegan, macrobiotic and sattvic dishes that play up the wild and the organic. Besides lunch specials such as Mexican quinoa chilli with fried bananas and tofu red curry, it's a nice place to stop for a juice, smoothie or just some positive vibes.
Claras em CasteloPORTUGUESE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %218 853 071; Rua Bartolomeu de Gusmão 31; mains €10.50-14.50; h10.30am-2am Thu-Tue)
Just steps from the castle entrance, this tiny restaurant enjoys a loyal following for its warm service and solid home cooking. Dishes such as bacalhau com natas (cod in a creamy sauce) pair nicely with reasonably priced wines. Booking ahead is highly advisable.
Marcelino Pão e VinhoPORTUGUESE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua do Salvador 62; mains €5-14; h10am-midnight Mon-Tue, to 2am Thu-Sun; W)
What this narrow cafe lacks in space it makes up for in atmosphere, with local artworks on the walls, occasional live music, traditional hats suspended from the ceiling and wine-crate-lined walls. It's a cosy space for refreshing sangria, and salads, sandwiches, quiches, fondue (cheese and chocolate!), desserts and other tapas.
Páteo 13PORTUGUESE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/pateo13; Calçadinha de Santo Estêvão 13; mains €7-9; h11am-11pm Tue-Sun, closed Nov-Feb; W)
Follow the scent of chargrilled fish to this local favourite tucked away on a small, festively decorated plaza in the Alfama. Join buzzing crowds hunkered over picnic tables as they feast on barbecued seafood and meats, washed down with ever-flowing Alentejan reds.

French chef David Eyguesier honed his skills at Pois Café, then his own underground restaurant at home before opening this sorely needed Alfama gem whose name loosely translates as 'The Truants' (he 'skipped' culinary school!). His daily-changing, market-fresh set menus delight under a spiderweb of modern lighting, beautiful geometric cabinetry and an open kitchen. No microwave. No freezer!

Up a spiral iron staircase from this circus school's casual cafe, the decidedly creative menu of Chef Bertílio Gomes is served alongside views worth writing home about. His modern takes include classic dishes (bacalhau à Brás, stewed veal cheeks, suckling pig), plus daring ones (rooster testicles – goes swimmingly with a drop of Quinta da SIlveira Reserva).

Entering the stained-glass-draped and palm-covered entrance hall of this hidden 20th-century mansion feels like a discovery, though the secret that this is one of Lisbon's top brunches is certainly out. The exquisite tearoom books up fast with socialites and foodies gnawing on towers of creamy cheeses and house-baked breads, savoury cold cuts, warm croissants and fresh-squeezed juices.
A Travessa do FadoPORTUGUESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Largo do Chafariz de Dentro 1; mains €6.50-16; h12.30-11.30pm Wed-Sun; W)
Nontouristy restaurants are hard to come by in Alfama, but this one, the more casual sister restaurant to high-end A Travessa ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 902 034; www.atravessa.com; Travessa do Convento das Bernardas 12; mains €20-35; h7.30pm-midnight Mon-Sat; W), gets a nod for its sun-drenched, flower-draped terrace, which is quite a nice spot for chasing classics such as stuffed squid or sea-bass rice with a refreshing vinho verde (young wine).
India GateINDIAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua da Padaria 18; mains €8-11.50; hnoon-3pm & 6-10pm Mon-Sat; W)
If you just can't deal with any more bacalhau, Gujarati owners at this classy curry house oversee some of Lisbon's best Indian cuisine and are unafraid to give it a bit of bite if you beg. The solid menu of chicken, lamb, shrimp and veg classics (including some Goan specialities), served sizzling in traditional cookware, is a welcome respite.
Santa Clara dos CogumelosINTERNATIONAL€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %218 870 661; www.santaclaradoscogumelos.com; Campo de Santa Clara 7; petiscos €5-8, mains €14-17; h7.30-11pm Tue-Fri, 1-3.30pm & 7.30-11pm Sat; v)
If you're a mushroom fan, this novel restaurant in the old market hall on Campo de Santa Clara is simply magic. The menu is an ode to the humble cogumelo (mushroom). Go for petiscos such as organic shitake with garlic and coriander, mains like risotto with porcini and black trumpets, and perhaps mushroom ice cream with brownies for dessert.
Santo António de AlfamaPORTUGUESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %218 881 328; www.siteantonio.com; Beco de São Miguel 7; mains €13.50-19.50; h12.30-7pm & 8pm-2am; W)
This bistro wins the award for Lisbon’s loveliest summer courtyard: all vines, twittering budgies and fluttering laundry (though you'll struggle to find it at all in winter). The interior is a silver-screen shrine, while the menu stars tasty petiscos (appetisers): breaded brie with raspberry compote, blood sausage with apple purée, as well as more filling traditional Portuguese dishes.
DeliDeluxCAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.delidelux.pt; Av Infante Dom Henrique, Armazém B, Loja 8; mains €6.90-10.40; h10am-10pm Sun-Thu, to midnight Fri-Sat; W)
Besides a bounty of wine, cheeses, olive oils and other gourmet goodies, this deli's wonderful waterfront patio has yet to be discovered by tourists (despite this string of converted warehouses being attached – though not accessible from – the cruise-ship terminal). The charcuterie plates, salads, sandwiches and other light bites are all of exceptional quality.

oGelataria NannarellaICE CREAM€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/gelaterianannarella; Rua Nova da Piedade 68; small/medium/large €2/2.50/3; hnoon-10pm)
This is where you'll get Lisbon's best gelato. Seatless Nannarella is squeezed into little more than a doorway, where Roman transplant Constanza Ventura churns out some 25 perfect, spatula-slabbed flavours of traditional gelato/sorbet daily to anxious lines of lisboêtas. Nailing both consistency and flavour, this sweet, sweet stuff from which heaven is made seemingly emerges straight from Ventura's kitchen.
oBettina & Niccolò CoralloSWEETS€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.claudiocorallo.com; Rua da Escola Politécnica 4; chocolate per kg from €90; h10am-7pm Mon-Sat)
Few chocolates command such undying devotion, but this family-run transplant from São Tomé and Príncipe elicits freakish enthusiasm for their thin artisan chocolate bars. Indeed, in ginger, orange, sea salt and pepper, sesame, and toffee and sea salt varieties, this is heart-stoppingly good stuff. Try a free sample with the excellent espresso before committing.
Dona QuitériaPORTUGUESE€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %213 951 521; Travessa de São José 1; small plates €5-12; h7pm-midnight Tue-Sun)
Locals do their best to keep this quaint corner petiscaria (small plates restaurant), a former grocery store from 1870, all to themselves – no such luck. Pleasant palette surprises such as tuna pica-pau instead of steak, or a pumpkin-laced cream-cheese mousse for dessert, put tasty creative spins on tradition.

Just arriving at your table is a memorable ride, sliding past an enormous illustration from Ana Gil, a beautiful Prosecco bar and minimalist copper lamps and muted grey walls leading to an impressive, oak-fired pizza oven.

This 18th-century house, opening onto a tree-shaded courtyard, has oodles of charm and serves Med-style and Portuguese dishes such as creamy Brazilian-style shrimp-stew risotto and truffled black pork. The service is faultless, the food a worthy runner-up.
CERCA VELHA: LISBON'S MEDIEVAL WALL

There are vestiges of Lisbon's medieval defensive wall scattered about Alfama and around – but you might walk right past them if you aren't paying attention or don't know where to look. Enter Lisbon city hall, which has teamed up with the Museu de Lisboa and Centro de Arqueologia de Lisboa, to create the free walking tour, Muralhas de Lisboa: Cerca Velha, based on intense historical and archaeological investigations of the city's pre-1147 fortified defence system (and later construction of the Fernandina wall from 1373–75).
There are 16 signposted points of interest along the circular 1500m path, beginning and ending near Castelo de São Jorge from Rua do Chão da Feira, down to the water and back around up to Porta de Alfofa. Notable stops include No 2 (Pátio Dom Fradique) – this 186m stretch of the wall is the longest intact section – and No 4 (Rua Norberto de Araújo), where the only Islamic portion of the wall is visible.
You'll need to pick up the city hall's very helpful brochure and map, available in several languages at Casa dos Bicos, and Castelo de São Jorge, among other points.

The local and international craft-beer list is one of Lisbon's most impressive.

No airs, no graces, just hearty helpings of Portuguese soul food served by delightfully old-school servers are what you can expect at this beamed restaurant. The monkfish and clams in garlic and coriander sauce is superb, and so is the duck rice. Don't skip that dessert cart!

Midway between restaurant and clubby lounge-bar, Guilty is the casual stalwart of Lisbon master-chef Olivier. With its bare brick walls, leather sofas, cowhides and young, good-looking crowd, it's sexy and it knows it, but this is the place to come for thick, perfectly juicy Black Angus or Wagyu burgers, pasta, speciality pizzas and DJ beats.

At one of Lisbon's best Indian restaurants, jovial chef Jesus Lee whips up contemporary Goan delicacies. Rice-sack tablecloths and colourful murals (note the playful Christian-Hindu imagery) set the scene for feasting on starters such as onion-coriander chickpea fritters or potato bhaji with puri; followed by mushroom and chestnut or shrimp curries, shrimp biryani or 11-spices goat – all fiery-fantastic.

Bright, noisy and full to the gills, this bustling beer hall is popular with local seafood fans, some of whom just belly up to the bar, chase their fresh shrimp and tremoços (Lupin beans) with an ice-cold imperial (draught beer) and call it a night. The shellfish are plucked fresh from the tank, weighed and cooked to lip-smacking perfection.

Small, unassuming and fun, Maria Mil Reis offers great-value Portuguese standards among the sea of ritzier options around Avenida da Liberdade. There is a distinct Brazilian vibe both with staff (chef and serving staff are brasileiros), some of the food (the house codfish is served Brazilian moqueca-style, with coconut milk and shrimp) and the giant goblets of wine.

Pastelaria ResteloBAKERY€

Better known as Pastelaria O Careca ('The Bald Guy') among locals, this simple pastelaria (pastry and cake shop) flanking a small plaza has been dishing out Lisbon's sweetest croissants since 1954. It's definitely worth heading a few blocks inland from the tourist onslaught along Belém's waterfront for the doughy, sugar-coated goodness.

Don't be fooled by the nondescript decor and railroad-track views – when a tucked-away place is this crowded with locals at lunchtime midweek, they must be doing something right. They're all here for one thing and one thing only: leitão – suckling pig spit-roasted on an open fire until juicy and meltingly tender, doused in a beautiful peppery garlic sauce.

Transport yourself to China at this authentic Szechuan powerhouse (tamed for local tastes), a Chinese chain restaurant that chose Parque das Nações as their first foray outside the motherland. The daunting list of specialities, including Beijing duck (€26.90 for two), hotpots and plenty of garlic- and pepper-loaded dishes, are a welcome taste-bud change-up.

WORTH A TRIP
CRISTO REI

The sleepy seaside suburb of Cacilhas lies just across the Rio Tejo from the capital. Its star attraction – visible from almost everywhere in Lisbon – is 110m-high Cristo Rei (www.cristorei.pt; Alto do Pragal, Av Cristo Rei, Almada; adult/child €4/2; h9.30am-6pm). Perched on a pedestal, the statue of Christ with outstretched arms is a slightly more baroque version of Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer. It was erected in 1959 to thank God for sparing Portugal from the horrors of WWII. A lift zooms you up to a platform, from where Lisbon spreads magnificently before you. It’s a fantastic place for photos.
To reach the statue from Lisbon, take the breezy commuter ferry from Terreiro do Paço ferry terminal across the Tejo to Cacilhas (€1.20, 15 minutes), then bus 101 (€2 return). And make an afternoon of it: lisboêtas also flock to Cacilhas for the cervejarias (beer halls) serving fresh seafood, refreshing brews and fine views of the sun setting over the river.

Sintra
Less than an hour by train from the capital, Sintra feels like another world. Resembling an illustration from a fairy tale, it is sprinkled with stone-walled taverns and has a whitewashed palace looming over it. Forested hillsides form the backdrop to the village's storybook setting, with imposing castles, mystical gardens, strange mansions and centuries-old monasteries hidden among the woodlands. The fog that sweeps in by night adds another layer of mystery, and cool evenings are best spent fireside in one of Sintra’s many charming B&Bs.

AROUND LISBON
Sintra
With its rippling mountains, dewy forests thick with ferns and lichen, exotic gardens and glittering palaces, Sintra is like a page torn from a fairy tale. Its Unesco World Heritage–listed centre, Sintra-Vila, is dotted with pastel-hued manors folded into luxuriant hills that roll down to the blue Atlantic.
Celts worshipped their moon god here, the Moors built a precipitous castle, and 18th-century Portuguese royals swanned around its dreamy gardens. Even Lord Byron waxed lyrical about Sintra’s charms: ‘Lo! Cintra’s glorious Eden intervenes, in variegated maze of mount and glen’, which inspired his epic poem Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage.
It’s the must-do day trip and, if time’s not an issue, has more than enough allure to seize you for days.
Sintra has become quite popular, and it's hard to escape the tourist masses (especially in summer). Go early in the day midweek to escape the worst of the crowds.

oPalácio Nacional de SintraPALACE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.parquesdesintra.pt; Largo Rainha Dona Amélia; adult/child €10/8.50; h9.30am-7pm, shorter hours in low season)
The star of Sintra-Vila is this palace, with its iconic twin conical chimneys and lavish interior. The whimsical interior is a mix of Moorish and Manueline styles, with arabesque courtyards, barley-twist columns and 15th- and 16th-century geometric azulejos that figure among Portugal’s oldest.
Of Moorish origins, the palace was first expanded by Dom Dinis (1261–1325), enlarged by João I in the 15th century (when the kitchens were built), then given a Manueline twist by Manuel I in the following century.
Highlights include the octagonal Sala dos Cisnes (Swan Room), adorned with frescoes of 27 gold-collared swans; and the Sala das Pegas (Magpie Room), with its ceiling emblazoned with magpies. Lore has it that the queen caught João I kissing one of her ladies-in-waiting. The cheeky king claimed the kisses were innocent and all ‘por bem’ (‘for the good’), then commissioned one magpie for every lady-in-waiting.
Other standouts are the wooden Sala dos Brasões, bearing the shields of 72 leading 16th-century families, the shipshape Galleon Room and the Palatine chapel featuring an Islamic mosaic floor. Finally, you reach the restored kitchen of twin-chimney fame, where you can almost hear the crackle of a hog roasting on a spit for the king.
oCastelo dos MourosCASTLE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.parquesdesintra.pt; adult/child €8/6.50; h10am-6pm)
Soaring 412m above sea level, this mist-enshrouded ruined castle looms high above the surrounding forest. When the clouds peel away, the vistas over Sintra’s palace-dotted hill and dale, across to the glittering Atlantic are – like the climb – breathtaking.
The 10th-century Moorish castle’s dizzying ramparts stretch across the mountain ridges and past moss-clad boulders the size of small buses.
The best walking route here from Sintra-Vila is not along the main road but the quicker, partly off-road route via Rua Marechal Saldanha. The steep trail ( GOOGLE MAP ) is around 2km, but quiet and rewarding.
Tickets and info are available at the entrance ( GOOGLE MAP ; h10am-6pm).
oPalácio Nacional da PenaPALACE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.parquesdesintra.pt; combined ticket with Parque Nacional da Pena adult/child €14/12.50; h10am-6pm)
Rising from a thickly wooded peak and often enshrouded in swirling mist, Palácio Nacional da Pena is a wacky confection of onion domes, Moorish keyhole gates, writhing stone snakes and crenellated towers in pinks and lemons. It is considered the greatest expression of 19th-century romanticism in Portugal.
Ferdinand of Saxe Coburg-Gotha, the artist-husband of Queen Maria II, and later Dom Ferdinand II, commissioned Prussian architect Ludwig von Eschwege in 1840 to build the Mouresque-Manueline epic (and as a final flourish added an armoured statue representing a medieval knight overlooking the palace from a nearby peak). Inspired by Stolzenfels and Rheinstein castles and Potsdam's Babelsberg Palace, a flourish of imagination and colour commenced.
The eclectic, extravagant interior is equally unusual, brimming with precious Meissen porcelain, Portuguese-style furniture, trompe l’oeil murals and Dom Carlos’ unfinished nudes of buxom nymphs.
There are daily guided tours at 2.30pm. Buses depart from the entrance to the palace every 15 minutes (€3); otherwise it's a 10- to 15-minute walk uphill.
Parque da PenaGARDENS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %219 237 300; www.parquesdesintra.pt; adult/child €7.50/6.50, combined ticket with Palácio Nacional da Pena €14/12.50; h10am-6pm)
Nearly topped by King Ferdinand II's whimsical Palácio Nacional da Pena (only Cruz Alta, at 529m, is higher), these romantic gardens are filled with tropical plants, huge redwoods and fern trees, camellias, rhododendrons and lakes (note the castle-shaped duck houses for web-footed royalty!). Save by buying a combined ticket if you want to visit Palácio Nacional da Pena too.
While the crowds descend on the palace, another less-visited but fascinating site within the park is the Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs–evoking Chalet da Condessa d'Edla (adult/child €9.50/8.50), an Alpine-inspired summer getaway cottage commissioned by King Ferdinand II and his future second wife, Elise Hensler (the Countess of Edla).
Buses to the park entrance ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.parquesdesintra.pt) leave from Sintra train station and near Palácio Nacional de Sintra, among other spots around town. A taxi costs around €10 one-way. The steep, zigzagging walk through pine and eucalyptus woods from Sintra-Vila is around 3km to 4km.

Palácio & Parque de MonserratePALACE
( GOOGLE MAP ; www.parquesdesintra.pt; adult/child €8/6.50; h10am-6pm)
At the centre of a lush, 30-hectare park, a manicured lawn sweeps up to this whimsical, Moorish-Gothic-Indian palácio, the 19th-century romantic folly of English millionaire Sir Francis Cook. The wild and rambling gardens were created in the 18th century by wealthy English merchant Gerard de Visme, then enlarged by landscape painter William Stockdale (with help from London’s Kew Gardens).
Its wooded hillsides bristle with exotic foliage, from Chinese weeping cypress to dragon trees and Himalayan rhododendrons. Seek out the Mexican garden nurturing palms, yuccas and agaves, and the bamboo-fringed Japanese garden abloom with camellias.
The park is 3.5km west of Sintra-Vila.
Convento dos CapuchosMONASTERY
(Capuchin Monastery; GOOGLE MAP ; %219 237 300; www.parquesdesintra.pt; adult/child €7/5.50; h10am-8pm)
Hidden in the woods is this bewitchingly hobbit-hole-like convent, which was originally built in 1560 to house friars who lived in incredibly cramped conditions, their tiny cells having low, narrow doors. Byron mocked the monastery in his poem Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, referring to recluse Honorius who spent a staggering 36 years here (before dying at age 95 in 1596).
It’s often nicknamed the Cork Convent, because its minuscule cells are lined with cork. Visiting here is an Alice in Wonderland experience as you squeeze through to explore the warren of cells, chapels, kitchen and cavern. The monks lived a simple, touchingly well-ordered life in this idyllic yet spartan place, hiding up until 1834 when it was abandoned after all religious orders were abolished.
You can walk here – the monastery is 7.3km from Sintra-Vila (5.1km from the turn-off to Parque da Pena) along a remote, wooded road. There is no bus connection to the convent (taxis charge around €35 return; arrange for a pick-up ahead). Well-worth-it audioguides are available for €3.
Museu das Artes de SintraMUSEUM
(MU.SA; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cm-sintra.pt; Av Heliodoro Salgado; adult/child €1/free; h10am-8pm Tue-Fri, 2-8pm Sat-Sun)
This new museum took over the former Museu de Arte Moderna space in 2014 and features a small and manageable collection of contemporary and modern art, 80% or so of which is dedicated to local works. The permanent collection features some of Portugal's best-known artists, most notably painters Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro and António Carneiro and sculptor Dorita de Castel-Branco.
Museu Anjos TeixeiraMUSEUM
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Alameda Volta do Duche; h10am-6pm Tue-Fri, noon-6pm Sat & Sun)F
Set in a former watermill, this small museum displays works by the father-and-son duo of Anjos Teixeira – two of Portugal’s greatest sculptors. Most of the pieces here are the work of Pedro Augusto (1908–97), the son, who enjoyed greater success than his father, and was connected to the neorealism of the 1940s.

2Activities
Sintra is a terrific place to get out and stride, with waymarked hiking trails (look for red and yellow stripes) that corkscrew up into densely wooded hills strewn with giant boulders. Justifiably popular is the gentle 50-minute trek from Sintra-Vila to Castelo dos Mouros. You can continue to Palácio Nacional da Pena (another 15 minutes). From here you can ascend Serra de Sintra’s highest point, the 529m Cruz Alta (High Cross), named after its 16th-century cross, with amazing views all over Sintra. It’s possible to continue on foot to São Pedro de Penaferrim and loop back to Sintra-Vila. You can print off maps and info on various hiking trails from the municipality's website under 'Percursos Pedestres' (www.cm-sintra.pt).
Horse riding is available in the Parque da Pena, from 30-minute teasers (€10) to six-hour excursions (€100).

DON'T MISS
A SURREAL MANSION & GARDENS

Exploring the Quinta da Regaleira ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.regaleira.pt; Rua Barbosa du Bocage; adult/child €6/3; h10am-8pm high season, shorter hours in low season) is like delving into another world. This neo-Manueline extravaganza was dreamed up by Italian opera-set designer Luigi Manini under the orders of Brazilian coffee tycoon, António Carvalho Monteiro, aka 'Monteiro dos Milhões' ('Moneybags Monteiro'). Enter the villa to begin the surreal journey, with ferociously carved fireplaces, frescoes and Venetian-glass mosaics. Keep an eye out for mythological and Knights Templar symbols.
The playful gardens are fun to explore – footpaths wriggle through the dense foliage to follies, fountains, grottoes, lakes and underground caverns. All routes seem to eventually end at the revolving stone door leading to the initiation well, Poço Iniciático, plunging some 27m. You walk down the nine-tiered spiral (three by three – three being the magic number) to mysterious hollowed-out underground galleries, lit by fairy lights.
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
SWEET DREAMS

Sintra is famous for its luscious sweeties. Fábrica das Verdadeiras Queijadas da Sapa has been fattening up royalty since 1756 with bite-sized queijadas – crisp pastry shells filled with a marzipan-like mix of fresh cheese, sugar, flour and cinnamon. Since 1952, Casa Piriquita has been tempting locals with another sweet dream: the travesseiro (pillow), light puff pastry turned, rolled and folded seven times, then filled with delicious almond-and-egg-yolk cream and lightly dusted with sugar.



8Getting There & Away

Bus 418 heads to Estoril (€3.50, 40 minutes). Most services leave from Sintra train station ( GOOGLE MAP ) (which is estação on timetables) and travel via Portela de Sintra. Scotturb’s useful information office, open 9am to 1pm and 2pm to 8pm, is opposite the station. Mafrense (%261 816 152; www.mafrense.pt) buses head to Mafra (€3.40, 45 minutes) and Ericeira (€3.40, 45 minutes) from the Portela Interface ( GOOGLE MAP ; Largo Vasco da Gama) on the north side of Portela da Sintra station.
Comboios de Portugal trains (€2.15, 40 minutes) run every 15 minutes between Sintra and Lisbon’s Rossio station.
If arriving by train, go to the last stop – Sintra – from where it’s a pleasant 1km walk (or short bus ride) into the village.

8Getting Around
BUS
From the train station it’s a 1km scenic walk into Sintra-Vila, or you can hop on bus 435, which goes from the station to Sintra-Vila (€1). This bus continues on to Quinta da Regaleira and Palácio de Monserrate.
A handy bus for accessing the Castelo dos Mouros is Scotturb bus 434 ( GOOGLE MAP ; Praça da República) (€5), which runs frequently from the train station via Sintra-Vila to the castle (10 minutes), Palácio Nacional da Pena (15 minutes) and back. One ticket gives you hop-on, hop-off access (in one direction; no backtracking).
You can also purchase a daily €12 hop-on, hop-off Scotturb ticket that works across the entire network and is valid in any direction until midnight. Be prepared to wait – even in winter the bus lines outside major attractions can be long.
SPEEDY TRANSPORT

If you have limited time and you'd like to see some of the attractions beyond Sintra-Vila, Sight Sintra ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %219 242 856; www.sightsintra.pt; Rua João de Deus; tour €35-45; h10am-7pm) rents out tiny two-person buggies that guide you by GPS along one of three different routes. The most popular takes you to Castelo dos Mouros and Palácio da Pena among other sites. It's located around the corner from the train station. You can also create your own itinerary, and hire a buggy for €25 per hour.
CAR
Driving can be a challenge on the narrow roads around Sintra. Parking is limited around town and there are very few spaces at Palácio Nacional da Pena, so it's better to avoid driving there in busy times. For parking near town, there’s a free car park below Sintra-Vila; follow the signs by the câmara municipal (town hall) in Estefânia. Alternatively, park at Portela Interface and take the bus.
TAXI
Taxis are available at the train station or opposite Sintra-Vila post office. They are metered, so fares depend on traffic. Count on about €10 one-way to Palácio Nacional da Pena; if you want them to wait, the meter runs at €15 per hour; expect to pay about €25 to €30 for a return visit to Convento dos Capuchos.
TRAM
On weekends, Sintra’s restored electric tram, the Elétrico de Sintra ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.cm-sintra.pt; one-way €3; hFri-Sun 8 May–21 Jun) offers access to the coast, running from Rua Alves Roçadas near Portela de Sintra train station, arriving at Praia das Maçãs 45 minutes later. Trams depart hourly from 10.20am to 5pm from Friday to Sunday (11.55am to 6.45pm Saturday and Sunday). The last tram back leaves the beach at 5.45pm during the week and 6pm on weekends.





Queluz
Palácio de QueluzPALACE
(%219 237 300; www.parquesdesintra.pt; adult/child €10/8.50; h9am-5.30pm, to 7pm high season)
Versailles’ fanciful cousin-once-removed, the powder-puff Palácio de Queluz was once a hunting lodge, converted in the late 1700s to a royal summer residence. It’s surrounded by queen-of-hearts formal gardens, with oak-lined avenues, fountains (including the Fonte de Neptuno, ascribed to Italian master Bernini) and an azulejo-lined canal where the royals went boating.
The palace, whose facade was restored to its original 'enamel blue' during a massive 2015 restoration, was designed by Portuguese architect Mateus Vicente de Oliveira and French artist Jean-Baptiste Robillon for Prince Dom Pedro in the 1750s. Pedro’s niece and wife, Queen Maria I, lived here for most of her reign, going increasingly mad. Her scheming Spanish daughter-in-law, Carlota Joaquina, was quite a match for eccentric British visitor William Beckford. On one occasion she insisted that Beckford run a race with her maid in the garden and then dance a bolero, which he did ‘in a delirium of romantic delight’.
Inside it's like a chocolate box, with a gilded, mirror-lined Throne Room and Pedro IV’s bedroom where he slept under a circular ceiling, surrounded by Don Quixote murals. The palace’s vast kitchens now house a palatial restaurant, Cozinha Velha (%214 356 158; www.pousadas.pt; mains €17-30; h1-3pm & 7.30-10pm), where you can feast on original palace recipes such as the steamed Dover sole.
Once you’ve seen the palace, live the life: the Royal Guard of the Court quarters have been converted into the dazzling Pousada de Dona Maria I (%214 356 158; www.pousadas.pt; Largo do Palácio de Queluz; s/d from €120/130; aW), with high-ceilinged rooms that will make you feel as if you’re at home with the royals.
Queluz (keh-loozh) is 12km northwest of Lisbon and makes an easy day trip. Frequent trains from Lisbon's Rossio station stop at Queluz-Belas (€1.55, 18 minutes).

Mafra
Mafra, 39km northwest of Lisbon, makes a superb day trip from Lisbon, Sintra or Ericeira. It is home to Palácio Nacional de Mafra, Portugal’s extravagant convent-palace hybrid with 1200 rooms. Nearby is the beautiful former royal park, Tapada Nacional de Mafra, once a hunting ground and still teeming with wild animals and plants.
The monumental palace facade dominates the town. Opposite is a pleasant square, Praça da República, which is lined with cafes and restaurants.

Palácio Nacional de MafraPALACE
(%261 817 550; www.palaciomafra.pt; Terreiro Dom João V; adult/child €6/free, free 1st Sun of the month; hpalace 9am-6pm Tue-Sun, basilica 9.30am-1pm & 2-5.30pm)
Wild-spending Dom João V poured pots of Brazilian gold into this baroque palace, covering a mind-boggling 4 sq km and comprising a monastery and basilica. Begun in 1717 and finished by 1746, the exuberant mock-marble confection is the handiwork of German master Friedrich Ludwig, who trained in Italy and clearly had a kind of Portuguese Vatican in mind.
No expense was spared: around 45,000 artisans worked on building its 1200 rooms and two bell towers, which shelter the world’s largest collection of bells (97 in total, 92 of which are original).
When the French invaded Portugal in 1807, Dom João VI and the royals skedaddled to Brazil, taking most of Mafra’s furniture with them. Imagine the anticlimax when the French found nothing but 20 elderly Franciscan friars. General Junot billeted his troops in the monastery, followed by Wellington and his men. From then on the palace became a military haven. Even today, much of it is occupied by the military as an academy.
On a self-guided visit, you’ll take in treasures such as the antler-strewn hunting room, a striking infirmary, the gorgeous Blessing Room, awash in colorful Lioz stone and a walled bed for mad monks (maybe sent over the edge by all those corridors!). The biggest stunner is the 83.6m-long barrel-vaulted library, housing some 36,000 book volumes encasing an as-yet-uncounted 100,000-plus 15th- to 18th-century books, many handbound by the monks. It’s an appropriate fairy-tale coda to all this extravagance that they’re gradually being gnawed away by rats. The basilica of twin bell-tower fame is strikingly restrained by comparison, featuring multihued marble floors and Carrara marble statues.
Aldeia Típica José FrancoAMUSEMENT PARK
(Estrada Nacional 116; h9.30am-7pm, to 6pm Oct-Mar)F
At the village of Sobreiro, 4km northwest of Mafra (take any Ericeira-bound bus), sculptor José Franco has created an enchanting miniature, vaguely surreal craft village of windmills, watermills and traditional shops. Kids love it here; as do some adults, especially when they discover the rustic adega (winery) serving red wine and snacks. Most folks, however, bring a picnic.
Tapada Nacional de MafraFOREST
(%261 814 240; www.tapadademafra.pt; Portão do Codeçal; activities €4.50-20; h9.30am-5.30pm)
The 819-hectare Tapada Nacional de Mafra is where Dom João V used to go a-hunting. Enclosed by an original 21km wall, the grounds are now an environmentally aware game park, home to free-roaming wild boar and red deer, plus smaller numbers of foxes, badgers and eagles.
To appreciate the different ecosystems, hike through its woodlands of Portuguese oak, cork oak and pine; don’t miss the 350-year-old cork oak saved from fire in 2003. The 4km trail is a good introduction to the park, but you have a greater chance of spotting animals on one of the more remote 7.5km routes. Also on the grounds is a simple but pleasantly furnished guesthouse (singles/doubles €45/55). On weekends, many activities are on offer, including horse riding (by advance reservation), archery and wagon rides, among others. You can also take a tourist 'train' around the park, which, unfortunately, leads to organised feedings to guarantee spottings.
The Tapada is about 7km north of Mafra, along the road to Gradil. It’s best reached by private transport, as buses are erratic; from Mafra, taxis charge around €10 one way.

A WOLF IN THE WOODS

Centro de Recuperação do Lobo IbéricoWILDLIFE RESERVE
(Iberian Wolf Sanctuary; %261 785 037; http://lobo.fc.ul.pt; Vale da Guarda, Picão; adult/concession €6/4; h4pm & 6pm Sat-Sun May-Sep, 3pm & 4.30pm Sat & Sun Oct-Apr)
There’s no need to be afraid of the wolves at the Centro de Recuperação do Lobo Ibérico located near Malveira, 10km east of Mafra. The centre is home to around 16 wolves that can no longer live in the wild. Visits are by 90-minute guided tours.
Set in a forested valley, the centre aims to boost the rapidly dwindling numbers of the Iberian wolf population (now just 300 in the wild in Portugal, along with an additional 1700 in Spain) by affording them safe shelter in a near-to-natural habitat inside five 1-hectare enclosures. As the wolves are free to roam in their large enclosures, there’s no guarantee that you’ll spot them, but encounters are frequent. There are volunteering opportunities as well. The sanctuary is best reached by private transport (call ahead for directions as GPS will take you an impassable way). Cash only (no strollers, no wheelchairs).
