		Mosteiro dos Jerónimos
			Dom Manuel I’s fantastical tribute to the great explorers of the 15th century
				Manuel I commissioned it to trumpet Vasco da Gama’s discovery of a sea route to India in 1498
				
			Jerónimos was once populated by monks of the Order of St Jerome, whose spiritual job for four centuries was to comfort sailors and pray for the king’s soul. When the order was dissolved in 1833, the monastery was used as a school and orphanage until about 1940

			entering the church through the western portal, you’ll notice tree-trunk-like columns that seem to grow into the ceiling, which is itself a spiderweb of stone. Windows cast a soft golden light over the church. Superstar Vasco da Gama is interred in the lower chancel, just left of the entrance, opposite venerated 16th-century poet Luís Vaz de Camões. From the upper choir, there’s a superb view of the church; the rows of seats are Portugal’s first Renaissance woodcarvings
			
			there’s nothing like the moment you walk into the honey-stone Manueline cloisters, dripping with organic detail in their delicately scalloped arches, twisting auger-shell turrets and columns intertwined with leaves, vines and knots. It will simply wow. Keep an eye out for symbols of the age such as the armillary sphere and the cross of the Military Order, plus gargoyles and fantastical beasties on the upper balustrade

			We did eventually get into the correct line to buy monastery tickets - it was very slow moving. Then another line was actually to enter the monastery, and I'm still not sure why, but they said with our tickets we could now skip the line, even though other people had them. There was yet another line for the church, which again moved quite slowly.

			We queued for an hour to get into the church.
			The ques are enormous and our time was too short in Lisbon to waste.
			It may be that because it was a Tuesday and this place is closed on a Monday that explains why the queues were so considerable
			We queued for the church (which is free and does not require a ticket) but gave it up as a bad job. Over 300 people in line but in twenty minutes of waiting they had let fewer than 15 people.

			When I managed to contact the company aiming to have a tour for my friends with Inês as our guide, José (the company representative with who I had the email exchange) seemed to do everything to prevent that from happening: - They keep the schedule of specific guides secret, so it's not possible to join the tour of the guide you'd like.
