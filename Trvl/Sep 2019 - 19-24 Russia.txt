History
Moscow is first mentioned in the historic chronicles in 1147, when Prince Yury Dolgoruky invited his allies to a banquet: ‘Come to me, brother, please come to Moscow’. It was Yury who ordered the construction of a moat-ringed wooden palisade on the hilltop, the first Kremlin. Traders and artisans set up just outside the Kremlin’s walls turning Moscow into an economic as well as strategic centre.

Medieval Moscow
In the early half of the 13th century, the ferocious Golden Horde, a Mongol-led army of nomadic tribesmen, burned Moscow to the ground and killed its governor. The Golden Horde was mainly interested in tribute, and Moscow was conveniently situated to monitor the river trade and road traffic. As Moscow prospered, its political fortunes rose too. It soon surpassed Vladimir and Suzdal as the regional capital.
In the 1380 Battle of Kulikovo, Moscow’s Grand Prince Dmitry defeated the Golden Horde on the banks of the Don River. He was thereafter immortalised as Dmitry Donskoy. From this time, Moscow acted as champion of the Russian cause.
Towards the end of the 15th century, Moscow emerged as an expanding autocratic state. Under the long reign of Grand Prince Ivan III (the Great), the eastern Slav principalities were consolidated into a single territorial entity. In 1480 Ivan’s army faced down the Mongols at the Ugra River without a fight: the 200-year Mongol yoke was lifted.
Subsequently, Ivan III renovated the Kremlin, adding its brick walls and imposing watchtowers. Next to the Kremlin, traders and artisans congregated in Kitay Gorod, and a stone wall was erected around these commercial quarters. The city developed in concentric rings outward from this centre. As it emerged as a political capital, Moscow also took on the role of religious centre. In the mid-15th century, the Russian Orthodox Church was organised, independent of the Greek Church. Under Ivan IV (the Terrible), the city earned the nickname ‘Gold-Domed Moscow’ because of the multitude of monastery fortresses and magnificent churches constructed within them.

Imperial Moscow
In 1712, Peter the Great, who hated Moscow, announced the relocation of the capital to a swampland in the northwest that would become St Petersburg. Moscow fell into decline, later exacerbated by an outbreak of bubonic plague.
By the turn of the 19th century, Moscow had recovered from its gloom. By this time, the city hosted Russia’s first university, museum and newspaper. Moscow’s intellectual and literary scene gave rise to a nationalist-inspired Slavophile movement, which celebrated the cultural features of Russia that were distinctive from the West.
In the early 1800s Tsar Alexander I decided to resume trade with England, in violation of a treaty Russia had made with France. A furious Napoleon Bonaparte set out for Moscow with the largest military force the world had ever seen. The Russian army engaged the advancing French at the Battle of Borodino, 130km from Moscow. More than 100,000 soldiers lay dead at the end of this inconclusive one-day fight. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon entered a deserted Moscow. By some accounts, defiant Muscovites burned down their city rather than see it occupied. French soldiers tried to topple the formidable Kremlin, but its sturdy walls withstood their pummelling.
The city was swiftly rebuilt following Napoleon’s final defeat. Monuments were erected to commemorate Russia’s hard fought victory, including a Triumphal Arch and the grandiose Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. Meanwhile, the city’s two outer defensive rings were replaced with the tree-lined Boulevard Ring and Garden Ring roads.
By midcentury, industry overtook commerce as the city’s economic driving force. With a steady supply of cotton from Central Asia, Moscow became a leader in the textile industry, and was known as ‘Calico Moscow’. By 1900, Moscow claimed more than one million inhabitants.

Red Moscow
The Bolshevik coup provoked a week of street fighting in Moscow, leaving more than 1000 dead. In 1918, fearing a German assault on St Petersburg, Lenin ordered that the capital return to Moscow.
In the 1930s Josef Stalin launched an industrial revolution, at the same time devising a comprehensive urban plan for Moscow. On paper, it appeared as a neatly organised garden city; unfortunately, it was implemented with a sledgehammer. Historic cathedrals and monuments were demolished, including landmarks such as the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and Kazan Cathedral. In their place appeared the marble-bedecked metro and neo-Gothic skyscrapers.
When Hitler launched ‘Operation Barbarossa’ into Soviet territory in June 1941, Stalin was caught by surprise. By December the Nazis were just outside Moscow, within 30km of the Kremlin, but an early winter halted the advance. In the Battle of Moscow, war hero General Zhukov staged a brilliant counteroffensive and saved the city from capture.
Stalin's successor, Nikita Khrushchev, a former mayor of Moscow, introduced wide-ranging reforms and promised to improve living conditions. Huge housing estates grew up round the city's outskirts. The expansion continued under Leonid Brezhnev. As the Soviet Union emerged as a military superpower, the aerospace, radio-electronics and nuclear weapons ministries operated factories and research laboratories in and around the capital. By 1980 the city’s population surpassed eight million.

Transitional Moscow
Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in March 1985 with a mandate to revitalise the ailing socialist system; he promoted Boris Yeltsin as the new head of Moscow. Yeltsin’s populist touch made him an instant success with Muscovites and he embraced the more open political atmosphere.
On 18 August 1991 the city awoke to find tanks in the streets. Gorbachev had been arrested and a self-proclaimed ‘Committee for the State of Emergency in the USSR’ proclaimed itself in charge. Crowds gathered at the White House to build barricades. Yeltsin, from atop a tank, declared the coup illegal. When KGB snipers didn’t shoot, the coup – and Soviet communism – was over. By the year’s end Boris Yeltsin had moved into the Kremlin.
The first years of transition were fraught with political conflict. In September 1993 Yeltsin issued a decree to shut down the Russian parliament. Events turned violent. The army intervened on the president’s side and blasted the parliament into submission. In all, 145 people were killed and another 700 wounded – the worst single incident of bloodshed in the city since the Bolshevik takeover in 1917.
In 1992 Yury Luzhkov was appointed as Moscow's mayor by Yeltsin; he would go on to win three elections to the position while building himself and his family a commercial empire. The city government retained ownership of property in Moscow, giving Luzhkov’s administration unprecedented control over would-be business ventures, and making him as much a CEO as a mayor.
While the rest of Russia struggled to survive the collapse of communism, Moscow quickly emerged as an enclave of affluence and dynamism. The new economy spawned a small group of ‘New Russians’, routinely derided and often envied for their garish displays of wealth.
In September 1999 a series of mysterious explosions in Moscow left more than 200 people dead. It was widely believed, although unproven, that Chechen terrorists were responsible for the bombings. This was the first of many terrorist attacks in the capital that were linked to the ongoing crisis in Chechnya, the worst of which was a siege of a Moscow theatre in 2002 that resulted in 120 deaths and hundreds of illnesses.

Millennium Moscow
In 2010, after 18 years in the job Luzhkov was replaced as Moscow mayor by Sergei Sobyanin, the former head of the presidential administration under Putin. Sobyanin promised a shift away from big business and huge construction projects to improving the city for regular-guy residents. To a large extent he has delivered as Moscow is gradually but noticeably becoming an easier, cleaner, more pleasant place to live.
While many Muscovites have lapped up the bread-and-circuses policies of the Putin-friendly city administration, not all are satisfied to sit back and accept politics as usual. In 2017, for the first time in years, a wave of anti-corruption protests took place in Moscow (and around the country). With the presidential election in 2018 – and Putin's certain participation – there are bound to be more. Still, most Muscovites are not in the mood for revolution.
Despite the conservative mood, Moscow has still managed to become one of Europe's coolest and most creative capitals. Gone are the days when the city was defined by New Russians' excessive displays of wealth. Nowadays, the capital's movers and shakers are the innovators – the artists, architects, designers and chefs – who are shaping the city's aesthetic and atmosphere.



NEIGHBOURHOODS AT A GLANCE

1Kremlin & Kitay Gorod
Red Square and the Kremlin are the historical, geographic and spiritual heart of Moscow, as they have been for nearly 900 years. The mighty fortress, the iconic onion domes of St Basil’s Cathedral and the granite mausoleum of Vladimir Ilych Lenin are among the city’s most important historical sights. The surrounding streets of Kitay Gorod are crammed with churches and old architecture. This is the starting point for any visit to Moscow.

2Tverskoy & Novoslobodsky
Moscow's busiest, swankiest and most commercialised district is also home to 20-plus theatres and concert halls, including the world-famous Bolshoi Theatre, several renowned galleries and – last but not least – the opulent Sanduny Baths. Beyond the Garden Ring, Tverskoy blends into the more relaxed Novoslobodsky district, home of the Jewish Museum and a cluster of bustling bars and restaurants around Mendeleyevskaya metro station.
3Meshchansky & Basmanny

Covering a large swathe of central Moscow, Meshchansky is markedly laid-back compared with its neighbouring districts. Here you'll find fewer offices, dominated as it is by prerevolutionary residential buildings. Beyond the Garden Ring, Basmanny is an area of 19th-century red-brick factories, now taken over by innovative postmodern galleries, cool cafes and digital startups. South of the Yauza, Taganskaya pl is a monster intersection that can be difficult to navigate, but the area is home to a few unusual sights, including Bunker-42 and the Museum of the Russian Icon.
4Presnya

The vast, diverse Presnya district spans the centuries, with a remarkable blend of building styles from the last three. The district’s ample attractions include its impressive and varied architecture, several noteworthy literary sites, and more traditional venues such as the zoo and planetarium. Presnya is also home to many of Moscow’s top restaurants, including the highly lauded Cafe Pushkin. The former textile factory at Tryokhgornaya (Трёхгорная Мануфактура фирменный магазин MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.trekhgorka.ru; Rochdelskaya ul 15; h9.30am-8.30pm Mon-Sat, 10am-6pm Sun; mBarrikadnaya) is fast becoming a centre for nightlife and dining.
5Arbat & Khamovniki

The side-by-side districts of Arbat and Khamovniki are rich with culture. Moscow’s most famous street, ul Arbat, is something of an art market, complete with portrait painters and soapbox poets, while the nearby streets are lined with museums and galleries, including the world-class Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts. Khamovniki is home to the ancient Novodevichy Convent and Cemetery, as well as several unique newer museums. Further out, it's worth a trip to the south side of the Moscow River for certain key destinations, such as triumphant Park Pobedy.
6Zamoskvorechie

With its low-rise buildings, quaint courtyards and multitude of onion domes, Zamoskvorechie is like a provincial Russian town that somehow ended up in central Moscow. The people responsible for the lingering old-world ambience are kuptsy (merchants) who populated the area until the 19th century and had completely different lifestyles and habits to the nobility living across the river. But modernity is very much present thanks to the ever-expanding gentrification belt that stretches along the river, showcasing beautifully renovated parks, art spaces and hipster clusters filled with restaurants and bars.
TOP SIGHT
MOSCOW KREMLIN
The apex of Russian political power and once the centre of the Orthodox Church, the Kremlin is not only the kernel of Moscow but of the whole country. From here, autocratic tsars, communist dictators and modern-day presidents have done their best – and worst – for Russia. These red-brick walls and tent-roof towers enclose 800 years of artistic accomplishment, religious ceremony and political clout.

Entrance Towers & Around
The Kutafya Tower (Кутафья башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ), which forms the main visitors’ entrance today, stands apart from the Kremlin’s west wall, at the end of a ramp over the Alexander Garden (Александровский сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mAleksandrovsky Sad). Pass through the Kremlin walls beneath the 1495 Trinity Gate Tower (Троицкая башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ); at 80m it's the tallest of the Kremlin’s towers.
Immediately inside the Trinity Gate Tower, the lane to the right (south) passes the 17th-century Poteshny Palace (Потешный дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ), which housed the first Russian theatre and where Stalin later lived. The bombastic marble, glass and concrete State Kremlin Palace (Государственный Кремлёвский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-620 7846; www.kremlinpalace.org/en), built between 1960 and 1961 for Communist Party congresses, is now home to the Kremlin Ballet.
Arsenal & Senate
North of the State Kremlin Palace is the 18th-century Arsenal (Арсенал MAP GOOGLE MAP ), commissioned by Peter the Great to house workshops and depots for guns and weaponry. Now home to the Kremlin Guard, the building is ringed with 800 captured Napoleonic cannons.
The offices of the president of Russia are in the yellow, triangular former Senate (Сенат MAP GOOGLE MAP ) building, a fine 18th-century neoclassical edifice, east of the Arsenal.
Patriach's Palace
Built for Patriarch Nikon mostly in the mid-17th century, the highlight of the Patriarch’s Palace (Патриарший дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ) is the ceremonial Cross Hall (Крестовая палата), where the tsar’s and ambassadorial feasts were held. From here you can access the five-domed Church of the Twelve Apostles (Церковь двенадцати апостолов), which has a gilded, wooden iconostasis and a collection of icons by leading 17th-century icon painters.
Assumption Cathedral
On the northern side of Sobornaya pl, the Assumption Cathedral (Успенский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ) is the focal church of prerevolutionary Russia and the burial place of most of the heads of the Russian Orthodox Church from the 1320s to 1700. If you have limited time, come straight here. The visitors entrance is at the western end.
The delicate single-domed Church of the Deposition of the Robe, beside the west door of the Assumption Cathedral, was built between 1484 and 1486 in exclusively Russian style.
Ivan the Great Bell Tower
With its two golden domes rising above the eastern side of Sobornaya pl, the Ivan the Great Bell Tower (Колокольня Ивана Великого MAP GOOGLE MAP ; R250; h10am-5pm Apr-Oct) is the Kremlin's tallest structure – a landmark visible from 30km away. Before the 20th century it was forbidden to build any higher in Moscow. Purchase a ticket to the architectural exhibit inside for a specifically timed admission to climb the 137 steps to the top for sweeping views.
Beside (not inside) the tower stands the world’s biggest bell (Царь-колокол MAP GOOGLE MAP ), a 202-tonne monster that has never rung.
KREMLIN TICKET OFFICE
The main ticket office is in Alexander Garden, next to the Kremlin wall. The ticket to the ‘Architectural Ensemble of Sobornaya pl’ covers entry to all five church-museums, as well as Patriarch’s Palace. It does not include the Armoury, the Diamond Fund Exhibition or Ivan the Great Bell Tower, but you can and should buy those tickets here too.

Archangel & Annunciation Cathedrals
The Archangel Cathedral (Архангельский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ) was for centuries the coronation, wedding and burial church of tsars. It was built by Ivan Kalita in 1333 to commemorate the end of the great famine, and dedicated to Archangel Michael, guardian of the Moscow princes.
The Annunciation Cathedral (Благовещенский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ), at the southwest corner of Sobornaya ploshchad, contains impressive murals in the gallery and an archaeology exhibit in the basement.
Great Kremlin & Armoury
The 700-room Great Kremlin Palace (Большой Кремлёвский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ), built as an imperial residence between 1838 and 1849, is now an official residence of the Russian president, used for state visits and receptions. Apart from the Armoury (Оружейная палата MAP GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R700/free; htours 10am, noon, 2.30pm & 4.30pm Fri-Wed; mAleksandrovsky Sad), it’s not open to the public.
Buy your time-specific ticket to the Armoury when you buy your ticket to the Kremlin. A one-hour audio guide is available to point out some of the collection's highlights. In Room 2, you'll find the renowned Easter eggs made by St Petersburg jeweller Fabergé.

ST BASIL'S CATHEDRAL
At the southern end of Red Square stands the icon of Russia: St Basil’s Cathedral. This crazy confusion of colours, patterns and shapes is the culmination of a style that is unique to Russian architecture. In 1552 Ivan the Terrible captured the Tatar stronghold of Kazan on the Feast of Intercession. He commissioned this landmark church, officially the Intercession Cathedral, to commemorate the victory.

Exterior
Created from 1555 to 1561, the cathedral’s apparent anarchy of shapes hides a comprehensible plan of nine main chapels. The tall, tent-roofed tower in the centre houses the namesake Church of the Intercession of the Mother of God. The four biggest domes top four octagonal-towered chapels: the Church of Sts Cyprian & Justina, Church of the Holy Trinity, Church of the Icon of St Nicholas the Miracle Worker, and the Church of the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem.
Legend has it that Ivan had the architects blinded so that they could never build anything comparable. This is a myth, however, as records show that they were employed a quarter of a century later (and four years after Ivan’s death) to add an additional chapel to the structure.
Interior
The Church of St Vasily the Blessed, the northeastern chapel on the 1st floor, contains the canopy-covered crypt of its namesake saint, one of the most revered in Moscow. This 10th chapel – the only one at ground level – was added in 1588, after the saint's death. Look for the icon depicting St Vasily himself, with Red Square and the Kremlin in the background.
With whitewashed walls and a spiralling symbol of eternity painted in the vault, the light-filled Church of the Holy Trinity is a favourite. A gorgeous 16th-century chandelier is suspended from the 20m ceiling. But the gem of the room is the unusual iconostasis.

The main building will remain open during the construction of the new museum complex on ul Volkhonka, which is expected to be completed in 2019. After the opening of the new complex, the exhibits are likely to change locations.
The Ancient Civilization exhibits contain a surprisingly excellent collection, complete with ancient Egyptian weaponry, jewellery, ritual items and tombstones. The Greek and Italian Courts contain examples from the museum's original collection, which was made up of plaster-cast reproductions of the masterpieces from Ancient Greece and Rome, as well as from the Renaissance.
The 17th and 18th centuries dominate the 2nd floor, with several sections devoted to Italian and French artists. The highlight of the museum is the selection of Dutch masterpieces in rooms 9 through 11. Rembrandt is the star of the show, with many paintings on display, including his moving Portrait of an Old Woman.
There is a separate gallery for the Rococo period, featuring some appropriate dreamy paintings by Boucher.

Second Floor
The tour of the gallery begins on the 2nd floor, where 18th- to 20th-century artists are exhibited. In the 1870s, daring artists started to use their medium to address social issues, thus founding the Peredvizhniki (Wanderers) movement. Artists to look out for include Vasily Perov (room 17), Ivan Kramskoi (room 20), Ivan Shishkin (room 25), Vasily Vereshchagin (room 27) and Nicholas Ge (room 31).
Ilya Repin (rooms 29 and 30) is perhaps the most beloved Russian realist painter. Mikhail Vrubel (rooms 32 to 34) was a Symbolist-era artist who defies classification.
First Floor
Moving into the 20th century, artists such as Konstantin Korovin (room 43) and Pavel Kuznetsov (room 46) began to reject the rules of realism. Nikolai Rerikh (Nicholas Roerich) shows off his fantastical storytelling style in room 47.
Room 55 houses the Treasury, with its collection of metals, jewellery, embroidery and precious knickknacks. Icons are found in rooms 56 to 62. Andrei Rublyov’s Holy Trinity (1420s) from Sergiev Posad, regarded as Russia’s greatest icon, is in room 60.
Contemporary exhibits are housed in the Engineer’s Building, next to the main building.

Activities
Activities include cycling, rollerblading, beach volleyball, extreme sports, table tennis and even pétanque. There are several bicycle- and skate-rental places around the park, with one conveniently located under the Andreyevsky pedestrian bridge. In winter, the ponds are flooded, turning the park into the city’s biggest ice-skating rink (Парк Горького MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-237 1266; ul Krymsky val; h10am-3pm & 5-11pm Tue-Sun; mPark Kultury).

Much less crowded than Gorky Park, full of shade, and criss-crossed by walking and cycling paths, it contains several sports facilities, including tennis courts, open-air table tennis and an open-air gym.
Culture
Art objects pop up throughout the park as part of various exhibitions and festivals, but the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art plays the flagship role.
The open-air Pioner cinema shows films after dark, although almost all are entirely in Russian. Its new competitor, Garage Screen, is located in front of Garage Museum of Contemporary Art.

(Красная площадь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Krasnaya pl; mPloshchad Revolyutsii)
Immediately outside the Kremlin’s northeastern wall is the celebrated Red Square, the 400m-by-150m area of cobblestones that is at the very heart of Moscow. Commanding the square from the southern end is St Basil’s Cathedral. This panorama never fails to send the heart aflutter, especially at night.
The word krasnaya in the name means 'red' now, but in old Russian it meant 'beautiful' and Krasnaya ploshchad lives up to this epithet. Furthermore, it evokes an incredible sense of import to stroll across the place where so much of Russian history has unfolded. Note that the square is often closed for various celebrations or their rehearsals, so allow some leeway in your schedule.

At the northern end of Red Square, the State History Museum has an enormous collection covering Russian history from the time of the Stone Age. The building, dating from the late 19th century, is itself an attraction – each room is in the style of a different period or region, some with highly decorated walls echoing old Russian churches.
The exhibits about medieval Rus are excellent, with several rooms covering the Mongol invasions and the consolidation of the Russian state. The 2nd floor is dedicated to the Imperial period, with exhibits featuring personal items of the royals, furnishings and decoration from the palace interiors, and various artworks and documents from the era. Specific rooms are dedicated to the rules of various tsars. An unexpected highlight is an exhibit addressing the expansion of the Russian Empire by examining the growing network of roads and how people travelled.
Saviour Gate TowerTOWER
(Спасская башня MAP GOOGLE MAP )
The Kremlin’s ‘official’ exit onto Red Square is the stately red-brick Saviour Gate Tower. This gate – considered sacred – has been used for processions since tsarist times. The two white-stone plaques above the gate commemorate the tower’s construction in 1491. The current clock was installed in the gate tower in the 1850s. Hauling 3m-long hands and weighing 25 tonnes, the clock takes up three of the tower’s 10 levels. Its melodic chime sounds every 15 minutes across Red Square.
Church of the Trinity in NikitnikiCHURCH
(Церковь Троицы в Никитниках MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Ipatyevsky per; mKitay-Gorod)
Hidden between big government blocks, this little gem of a church is an exquisite example of Russian baroque. Built in the 1630s, its onion domes and tiers of red-and-white spade gables rise from a square tower. Its interior is covered with 1650s gospel frescoes by Simon Ushakov and others. A carved doorway leads into St Nikita the Martyr’s Chapel, above the vault of the Nikitnikov merchant family, who were among the patrons who financed the church's construction.

Tomb of the Unknown SoldierMEMORIAL

This is a kind of national pilgrimage spot, where newlyweds bring flowers and have their pictures taken. The inscription reads: ‘Your name is unknown, your deeds immortal.’ Every hour on the hour, the guards perform a perfectly synchronised ceremony to change the guards on duty.

The Upper St Peter Monastery was founded in the 1380s as part of an early defensive ring around Moscow. The main, onion-domed Virgin of Bogolyubovo Church dates from the late 17th century. The loveliest structure is the brick Cathedral of Metropolitan Pyotr, restored with a shingle roof. When Peter the Great ousted the Regent Sofia in 1690, his mother was so pleased she built him this church.
Dostoevsky House-MuseumMUSEUM

Though this renowned Russian author is more closely associated with St Petersburg, Fyodor Dostoevsky was actually born in Moscow, where his family lived in a tiny apartment on the grounds of Mariinsky Hospital. He lived here until the age of 16, when he went to St Petersburg to enter a military academy. The family’s Moscow flat has been recreated according to descriptions written by Fyodor’s brother.

Viktor Vasnetsov was a Russian-revivalist painter, who drew inspiration from fairy tales and village mysticism. In 1894 he designed his own house in Moscow, which is now a museum. Fronted by a colourful gate, it is a charming home in neo-Russian style filled with the original wooden furniture, a tiled stove and many of the artist’s paintings. The attic studio, where he once worked, is now adorned with paintings depicting Baba Yaga and other characters from Russian fairy tales.

PARK ZARYADYE

Opening in late 2017 and rolling out over 2018 is Park Zaryadye, Moscow's first major new park in 50 years. Occupying a prominent site along the Moscow River, wedged into historic Kitay Gorod and a short walk from Red Square, it has been designed by the New York firm Diller Scofidio & Renfro (DS&R).
The 13-hectare park will include four different areas representing Russia's geographic zones – tundra, steppe, forest and wetlands – flowing seemlessly into each other. The most anticipated feature, perhaps, is a sort of bridge to nowhere, which stretches out across Moskvoretskaya nab and over the Moscow River, then loops back to Zaryadye.
In addition to the parkland, Zaryadye will contain a vast outdoor amphitheatre and several new museums, built into the hillsides and showcasing Russia's natural resources and richness.
The centrepiece is the Media Centre, where visitors can watch aerial-view films on a 39m movie screen. In the Time Machine Room, the history of Russia unfolds on a 360-degree screen that surrounds the viewers. Other exhibits and videos show off various national parks and promote travel within Russia.
The Zapavednaya Posolstvo (Conservation Embassy) will be a state-of-the-art museum featuring a large terrarium and laboratory space, offering many educational programs. A separate ice cave – kept below freezing year-round – will feature the creations of Arctic ice artist Alexander Ponomarev.
The smaller Podzemniy Museum (Underground Museum) is an archaeological exhibition, showing off a piece of the old Kitay Gorod wall that was uncovered during excavation.
Finally, the Zaryadye Park Pavilion (Павильон парка 'Зарядье' MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Moskvoretskaya ul) serves as a museum of Park Zaryadye, providing an overview of the park and its development.

JEWISH MUSEUM & CENTRE OF TOLERANCE

Occupying a heritage garage, purpose-built to house a fleet of Leyland double-deckers that plied Moscow's streets in the 1920s, this vast museum, filled with cutting-edge multimedia technology, tackles the uneasy subject of relations between Jews and the Russian state over the centuries. The exhibition relates the stories of pogroms, Jewish revolutionaries, the Holocaust and Soviet anti-Semitism in a calm and balanced manner. The somewhat limited collection of material exhibits is compensated for by the abundance of interactive video displays.
We especially like those that encourage visitors to search for answers to dilemmas faced by early 20th-century Jews – to stand up and fight, to emigrate or to assimilate and keep a low profile.
Russia's Jewish population was quite small until the 18th century, when the empire incorporated a vast chunk of Poland then inhabited by millions of Yiddish-speaking Jews. They were not allowed to move into Russia proper until the early 20th century – a policy that became known as the Pale of Settlement. This led to the perception of Jews as an ethnic, rather than religious group, which still lingers today.

Moscow's lovely botanic garden was established in 1706. Originally owned by the Moscow general hospital to grow herbs and other medicinal plants, its name translates, unsurprisingly, as Pharmacy Garden. Visitors can wander along the trails, enjoy an exhibition of ornamental plants and explore three greenhouses containing plants from more southerly climes.
LubyankaHISTORIC BUILDING
(Лубянка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Lubyanskaya pl; mLubyanka)
Easily the most feared edifice in Russia, looming on the northeastern side of Lubyanskaya pl is the brain centre behind Stalin's genocidal purges and the network of concentration camps known as Gulag. The building came into life circa 1900 as the headquarters of an insurance company, but was taken over by the CheKa (Bolshevik secret police) in 1919 and remained in the hands of its successors – OGPU, NKVD, MGB and finally KGB. The building is not open to the public.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-623 4401; www.sakharov-center.ru; ul Zemlyanoy val 57; h11am-7pm Tue-Sun; mChkalovskaya)F
South of Kursky vokzal, by the Yauza River, is a small park with a two-storey house containing a human-rights centre named after Russia's most famous dissident. Inside is a museum recounting the life of Sakharov, the nuclear-physicist-turned-human-rights-advocate, detailing the years of repression in Russia and providing a history of the courage shown by the dissident movement. Free English-language tours are available on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday; book in advance.
Chistye PrudyPARK
(Чистые пруды MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Chistoprudny bul; mChistye Prudy)
Clean Ponds is the lovely little pond that graces the Boulevard Ring at the ul Pokrovka intersection. The Boulevard Ring is always a prime location for strolling, but the quaint pond makes this a particularly desirable address. Paddle boats in summer and ice skating in winter are essential parts of the ambience. Buy a coffee, find a bench or sit on the grass, and watch the world go by.
SokolnikiPARK
(Сокольники MAP GOOGLE MAP ; c; mSokolniki)F
Changed beyond recognition in recent years, Sokolniki park is criss-crossed by cycling paths, and blends into a proper forest bordering on Losiny Ostrov national park (Национальный парк Лосиный остров). The area by the entrance (a short walk from Sokolniki metro station), centred on a fountain, is full of cool places to eat and welcoming benches. Further away, to the left of the entrance, is a funfair with rides and carousels. Another attraction is the Rosarium (Розариум), a manicured rose garden.
Museum of the Russian IconMUSEUM
(Частный музей русской иконы MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.russikona.ru; ul Goncharnaya 3; h11am-7pm Thu-Tue; mTaganskaya)F
This museum houses the private collection of Russian art patron Mikhail Abramov. He has personally amassed a collection of more than 4000 pieces of Russian and Eastern Christian art, including some 600 icons. The collection is unique in that it represents nearly all schools of Russian iconography. Highlights include Simon Ushakov’s 17th-century depiction of the Virgin Odigitria and an icon of St Nikolai Mirlikiisky.
Novospassky MonasteryMONASTERY
(Новоспасский монастырь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-676 9570; www.spasnanovom.ru; Verkhny Novospassky proezd; h7am-7pm; mProletarskaya)F
Novospassky Monastery, a 15th-century fort-monastery, is about 1km south of Taganskaya pl. The centrepiece of the monastery, the Transfiguration Cathedral, was built by the imperial Romanov family in the 1640s in imitation of the Kremlin’s Assumption Cathedral. Frescoes depict the history of Christianity in Russia, while the Romanov family tree, which goes as far back as the Viking Prince Rurik, climbs one wall. The other church is the 1675 Intercession Church.
Choral SynagogueNOTABLE BUILDING
(Московская Хopaльнaя Cинaгoга MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshoy Spasoglinishchevsky per 10; h9am-6pm; mKitay-Gorod)
Construction of a synagogue was banned inside Kitay Gorod, so Moscow’s oldest and most prominent synagogue was built just outside the city walls, not far from the Jewish settlement of Zaryadye. Construction started in 1881 but dragged on, due to roadblocks by the anti-Semitic tsarist government. It was finally completed in 1906 and was the only synagogue that continued to operate throughout the Soviet period, despite attempts to convert it into a workers’ club.
Yelokhovsky CathedralCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://elohov.ru; Spartakovskaya ul 15; mBaumanskaya)F
Built between 1837 and 1845, the Church of the Epiphany in Yelokhovo has been Moscow’s senior Orthodox cathedral since 1943. With five domes in a Russian eclectic style, the cathedral is full of gilt and icons, not to mention worshippers kneeling, polishing and lighting candles. In the northern part is the tomb of St Nicholas the Miracle Worker.
Rublyov Museum of Early Russian Culture & ArtMUSEUM

On the grounds of Andronikov Monastery, the Rublyov Museum exhibits icons from days of yore and the present. Unfortunately, it does not include any work by its acclaimed namesake artist, though it is still worth visiting, not least for its romantic location. Andrei Rublyov, the master of icon painting, was a monk here in the 15th century. He is buried in the grounds, but no one knows quite where.
Bunker-42 Cold War MuseumMUSEUM

On a quiet side street near Taganskaya pl, a nondescript neoclassical building is the gateway to the secret Cold War–era communications centre. The facility was meant to serve as the communications headquarters in the event of a nuclear attack. As such, the building was just a shell, serving as an entryway to the 7000-sq-metre space 60m underground. Now in private hands, the facility has been converted into a sort of a museum dedicated to the Cold War.
Vysotsky Cultural CentreMUSEUM
(Культурный центр Высоцкого MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.vysotsky.ru; Nizhny Tagansky tupik 3; R150; h11am-6pm Tue & Wed, Fri-Sun, 1-9pm Thu; mTaganskaya)
Part museum, part performance space, part art exhibit, this cultural centre pays tribute to local legend Vladimir Vysotsky (1938–80). Singer and songwriter, poet and actor, Vysotsky was one of the Soviet Union’s most influential pop-culture figures, thanks mostly to the witty lyrics and social commentary in his songs. The permanent exhibit features a slew of photos and documents, as well as personal items, such as the bard’s guitar.
WORTH A TRIP
VDNKH & OSTANKINO

Palaces for workers! There is no better place to see this Soviet slogan put into practice than at VDNKh ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mVDNKh), which stands for Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy. Built in 1939, the place feels like a Stalinesque theme park, with palatial pavilions, each designed in its own unique style to represent all the Soviet republics and various industries, from geology to space exploration. A thorough reconstruction, under way at the time of writing, is expected to breathe new life into the area.
Highlights include the People's Friendship Fountain surrounded by 16 gilded female figures dressed in ethnic costumes representing Soviet republics (the mysterious 16th figure stands for the Karelo-Finnish republic disbanded in 1956); the jaw-dropping Stone Flower Fountain, themed around Ural Mountains miners' mythology, and covered in semiprecious stones from the area; and the powerful Worker & Kolkhoz Woman ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-683 5640; http://moscowmanege.ru; R200; hnoon-9pm Tue-Sun; mVDNKh) monument designed by Vera Mukhina for the Soviet pavilion at 1937's Paris Expo.
Approaching VDNKh from the metro, the soaring 100m titanium obelisk is a monument 'To the Conquerors of Space’, built in 1964 to commemorate the launch of Sputnik. In its base is the Cosmonautics Museum ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kosmo-museum.ru; R250; h11am-7pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun, to 9pm Thu; mVDNKh), featuring cool space paraphernalia such as the first Soviet rocket engine and the moon rover Lunokhod. An inspiring collection of space-themed propaganda posters evokes the era of the space race.
To the west is Ostankino TV Tower (Останкинская башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-800-100 5553; https://tvtower.ru; adult/child R1000/500; h10am-10pm Mon-Thu, to 11pm Fri-Sun; mVDNKh). The 337m-high observation deck offers 360-degree views and – horror! – a bit of glass floor. Admission is by guided tour, which take place hourly and must be booked in advance; bring your passport. There's a 40% discount on 10am and 11am tours during weekdays.
HOTEL METROPOL

The Hotel Metropol is among Moscow’s finest examples of art nouveau architecture. The decorative panel on the hotel’s central facade, facing Teatralny proezd, is based on a sketch by the artist Mikhail Vrubel. It depicts the legend of the Princess of Dreams, in which a troubadour falls in love with a kind and beautiful princess and travels across the seas to find her. He falls ill during the voyage and is near death when he finds his love. The princess embraces him, but he dies in her arms. Naturally, the princess reacts to his death by renouncing her worldly life. The ceramic panels were made at the pottery workshop at Savva Mamontov’s estate in Abramtsevo.
The ceramic work on the side of the hotel facing Teatralnaya pl is by the artist Alexander Golovin. The script was originally a quote from Nietzsche: ‘Again the same story: when you build a house you notice that you have learned something’. During the Soviet era, these wise words were replaced with something more appropriate for the time: ‘Only the dictatorship of the proletariat can liberate mankind from the oppression of capitalism’. Lenin, of course.

Author of The Master and Margarita and Heart of a Dog, Mikhail Bulgakov was a Soviet-era novelist who was labelled a counter-revolutionary and censored throughout his life. His most celebrated novels were published posthumously, earning him a sort of cult following in the late Soviet period. Bulgakov lived with his wife, Tatyana Lappa, in a flat in this block, which now houses an arts centre and theatre (Булгаковский Дом и Театр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.dombulgakova.ru; 1st fl, Bolshaya Sadovaya ul 10; h1-11pm, to 1am Fri & Sat) on the ground floor, and a small museum in their actual flat.

The planetarium has become one of the biggest and brightest stars on the Moscow museum circuit, now incorporating all kinds of high-tech gadgetry, interactive exhibits and educational programs. The centrepiece is the Large Star Hall (the biggest in Europe!), with its 25m silver dome roof, a landmark that is visible from the Garden Ring. Narration for the shows is available in multiple languages.
NarkomfinNOTABLE BUILDING
(Наркомфин MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Novinsky bul 25; mBarrikadnaya)
The model for Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation design principle, this architectural landmark was an early experiment in semicommunal living. Designed and built in the 1920s by Moisei Ginzburg and Ignatii Milinis, Narkomfin offered housing for members of the Commissariat of Finances. In line with constructivist ideals, communal space is maximised and individual space is minimised. Apartments have minute kitchens (or none at all) to encourage residents to eat in the communal dining room. Tours are available through Moscow ArchiGeek.
Having been in a semiruinous state for many years, Narkomfin is finally slated for restoration – a three-year project that began in late 2017. The architect overseeing the project is Alexey Ginzburg, grandson of the original architect, who intends to preserve and restore as much of the constructivist detail as possible. The apartments are likely to remain in private hands but the communal block is expected to house a cultural centre and museum that will hopefully be open to the public.

(Музей искусства народов востока MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-691 0212; www.orientmuseum.ru; Nikitsky bul 12a; R400; h11am-8pm Tue-Sun; mArbatskaya)
This impressive museum on the Boulevard Ring holds three floors of exhibits spanning the Asian continent. Of particular interest is the 1st floor, dedicated mostly to the Caucasus, Central Asia and North Asia (meaning the Russian republics of Cukotka, Yakutia and Priamurie). Several rooms on the 2nd floor are dedicated to Nikolai Rerikh, the Russian artist and explorer who spent several years travelling and painting in Asia.
Patriarch’s PondsPARK
(Патриаршие пруды MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshoy Patriarshy per; mMayakovskaya)
Patriarch’s Ponds hark back to Soviet days, when the parks were populated with children and babushky. Today you’ll see grandmothers pushing strollers and lovers kissing on park benches. In summer, children romp on the swings, while winter sees them ice skating on the pond. The small park has a huge statue of 19th-century Russian writer Ivan Krylov, known to Russian children for his didactic tales.
Moscow ZooZOO

Renovations in honour of the zoo's 150th anniversary are ongoing, but the place should be in great shape in coming years. Huge flocks of feathered friends populate the central ponds, making for a pleasant stroll for birdwatchers. For a new perspective on Moscow’s nightlife, check out the nocturnal animal exhibit. Other highlights include the big cats (featuring Siberian tigers) and the polar bears. For more four-legged fun, follow the footbridge to see exhibits featuring animals from each continent.

Also known as the Gorky House-Museum, this fascinating 1906 art nouveau mansion was designed by architect Fyodor Shekhtel and gifted to celebrated author Maxim Gorky in 1931. The house is a visual fantasy with sculpted doorways, ceiling murals, stained glass, a carved stone staircase and exterior tilework. Besides the fantastic decor it contains many of Gorky’s personal items, including his extensive library.
Moscow Museum of Modern Art TverskoyMUSEUM
(MMOMA; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mmoma.ru; Tverskoy bul 9; R150; hnoon-8pm; mPushkinskaya)
This small exhibition space, known as the ‘Zurab Gallery', was formerly the studio of sculptor Zurab Tsereteli. As such, the space has seen many talented artists, musicians and writers among its guests. Nowadays it is an offshoot of the main MMOMA outlet on ul Petrovka, and continues to host exhibitions, performances and cultural events. Be sure to check the website to see what’s on, as the museum often closes between shows.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.rusimp.su; Bldg 11, Leningradsky pr 15; R250; h11am-8pm Fri-Tue, noon-9pm Wed-Thu; mBelorusskaya)
Few Russian artists embraced the Impressionist moniker, but many were influenced by the movement's style and techniques. At Moscow's newest art museum, billionaire art collector Boris Mint aims to educate and impress Muscovites (and visitors) about this important niche, at the same time showcasing his own collection, which includes works by the likes of Valentin Serov, Boris Kustodiev and Konstantin Korovin. The museum occupies part of the former Bolshevik chocolate factory – the sugar silo, to be exact. Sweet!

(Дом Гоголя MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.domgogolya.ru; Nikitsky bul 7; R150; hnoon-7pm Tue, Wed & Fri, 2-9pm Thu, noon-5pm Sat & Sun; mArbatskaya)
The 19th-century writer Nikolai Gogol spent his final tortured months here. The rooms – now a small but captivating museum – are arranged as they were when Gogol lived in them. You can even see the fireplace where he famously threw his manuscript of Dead Souls.
Tsereteli Studio-MuseumMUSEUM

Moscow’s most prolific artist has opened up his ‘studio’ as a space to exhibit his many masterpieces. You can’t miss this place – whimsical characters adorn the front lawn. They give just a tiny hint of what’s inside: a courtyard crammed with bigger-than-life bronze beauties and elaborate enamelwork.
The highlight work is undoubtedly Putin in his judo costume, although the huge tile Moscow cityscapes are impressive. You’ll also recognise some smaller-scale models of monuments that appear around town. Indoors, there are three floors of the master’s sketches, paintings and enamel arts.
Moscow International Business CentreAREA
(Москва-сити MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mDelovoi Tsentr)
This strip along the Moscow River is the site of one of the capital’s largest ongoing urban projects, also known as 'Moscow City'. Here, skyscrapers of glass and steel tower 20 storeys over the rest of the city, shining like beacons to Moscow’s wheeler-dealers and fortune-seekers. The 93-storey Tower East (Vostok) of the Federation complex is the tallest building in both Russia and Europe.

FROM WORKERS' FACTORIES TO HIPSTER HANG-OUTS

Like the Bolsheviks a hundred years ago, Moscow hipsters are capturing one factory after another and redeveloping them, according to their tastes.
Flakon ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.flacon.ru; ul Bolshaya Novodmitrovskaya 36; mDmitrovskaya) Arguably the most visually attractive of all the redeveloped industrial areas around Moscow, its mixture of brightly painted buildings and bare red brick resembling Portobello Rd in London. Once a glassware plant that produced bottles for the perfume industry, it is now home to dozens of funky shops and other businesses. Shopping for designer clothes and unusual souvenirs is the main reason for coming here.
Khlebozavod 9 The front entrance to this complex which was once a bread factory, is across the road from Flakon. Filling up with tenants at the time of writing, one of the early comers is Svoboda ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Novodmitrovskaya ul 1, str 9; hnoon-11.30pm; mDmitrovskaya), a craft-beer and music venue.
Winzavod Center for Contemporary Art (Винзавод MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.winzavod.ru; 4-y Syromyatnichesky per 1; mChkalovskaya). Formerly a wine-bottling factory, this post-industrial complex houses several art and photo galleries, as well as a few interesting gift shops and boutiques.
ArtPlay ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-620 0882; www.artplay.ru; ul Nizhny Syromyatnichesky per 10; hnoon-8pm Tue-Sun; mChkalovskaya) Occupying the former Manometer factory, this is home to firms specialising in urban planning and architectural design, as well as furniture showrooms and antique stores. Expect to see diverse and dynamic rotating exhibits in the display spaces.
Red October (Завод Красный Октябрь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bersenevskaya nab; mKropotkinskaya) The former Red October chocolate factory is a defiant island of Russian modernity and European-ness filled with cool bars, restaurants and galleries including Lumiere Brothers Photography Centre ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.lumiere.ru; Bolotnaya nab 3, bldg 1; R200-430; hnoon-9pm Tue-Fri, to 10pm Sat & Sun).

The Novodevichy Convent was founded in 1524 to celebrate the taking of Smolensk from Lithuania, an important step in Moscow’s conquest of the old Kyivan Rus lands. The oldest and most dominant building on the grounds is the white Smolensk Cathedral, with a sumptuous interior covered in 16th-century frescoes. Novodevichy is a functioning monastery. Women are advised to cover their heads and shoulders when entering the churches, while men should wear long pants.
Novodevichy CemeteryCEMETERY
(Новодевичье кладбище MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Luzhnetsky pr 2; h9am-5pm; mSportivnaya)F
Adjacent to the Novodevichy Convent, the Novodevichy Cemetery is one of Moscow’s most prestigious resting places – a veritable who’s who of Russian politics and culture. Here you will find the tombs of Bulgakov, Chekhov, Gogol, Mayakovsky, Prokofiev, Stanislavsky and Eisenstein, among many other Russian and Soviet cultural luminaries. The most recent notable addition to the cemetery is former President Boris Yeltsin, whose tomb is marked by an enormous Russian flag.
oCathedral of Christ the SaviourCHURCH
(Храм Христа Спасителя MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.xxc.ru; ul Volkhonka 15; h1-5pm Mon, from 10am Tue-Sun; mKropotkinskaya)F
This gargantuan cathedral was completed in 1997 – just in time to celebrate Moscow's 850th birthday. It is amazingly opulent, garishly grandiose and truly historic. The cathedral’s sheer size and splendour guarantee its role as a love-it-or-hate-it landmark. Considering Stalin's plan for this site (a Palace of Soviets topped with a 100m statue of Lenin), Muscovites should at least be grateful they can admire the shiny domes of a church instead of the shiny dome of Ilyich’s head.

The only private house built during the Soviet period, the home of Konstantin Melnikov stands as testament to the innovation of the Russian avant-garde. The architect created his unusual home from two interlocking cylinders – an ingenious design that employs no internal load-bearing wall. It was also experimental in its designation of living space, as the whole family slept in one room, divided by narrow wall screens.

(Дом-музей Пушкина MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.pushkinmuseum.ru; ul Arbat 53; R300; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun, noon-9pm Thu; mSmolenskaya)
After Alexander Pushkin married Natalia Goncharova at the nearby Church of the Grand Ascension, they moved to this charming blue house on the old Arbat. The museum provides some insight into the couple’s home life, a source of much Russian romanticism. (The lovebirds are also featured in a statue across the street.) The ground floor contains a broader exhibit about Pushkin in Moscow.

The permanent history exhibit here demonstrates how the city has spread from its starting point at the Kremlin. It is heavy on artefacts from the 13th and 14th centuries, especially household items and weapons, although there is little information in English. More exciting, the museum has space to launch thought-provoking temporary exhibits, including artists' and other locals' perspectives on the city.

Leo Tolstoy’s winter home during the 1880s and 1890s now houses an interesting museum dedicated to the writer’s home life. While it’s not particularly opulent or large, the building is fitting for junior nobility – which Tolstoy was. Exhibits here demonstrate how Tolstoy lived, as opposed to his literary influences, which are explored at the Tolstoy Literary Museum (Литературный музей Толстого MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tolstoymuseum.ru; ul Prechistenka 11; adult/student R250/100; hnoon-6pm Tue-Sun; mKropotkinskaya).

Part studio, part museum, the Burganov House is a unique venue in Moscow, where the craft goes on around you, as you peruse the sculptures and other artwork on display. Comprising several interconnected courtyards and houses, the works of surrealist sculptor Alexander Burganov are artfully displayed alongside pieces from the artist’s private collection. The surrounding streets of the Arbat and Khamovniki districts also contain many examples of the artist’s work.

SPARROW HILLS

The green hills in the south of Moscow are known as Sparrow Hills (Vorobyovy Gory). Running along the south side of the river bank, opposite the tip of the Khamovniki peninsula, is Vorobyovy Gory Nature Preserve (Воробьевы горы MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.vorobyovy-gory.ru; mVorobyovy Gory), a wooded hillside that is a less-developed, less-crowded extension of Gorky Park and Neskuchny Sad. The paved path that originates further north continues along the river for several kilometres, and bikes and skates are available to rent here.
Walking trails from the river bank wind up through the woods to a lookout point. From here, most of the city spreads out before you. The Stalinist spire of Moscow State University (Московский Государственный Университет; MGU MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Universitetskaya pl; mUniversitet) towers over the square. One of Stalin's ‘Seven Sisters’, the building is the result of four years of hard labour by convicts between 1949 and 1953. It boasts an amazing 36 storeys and 33km of corridors. The shining star that sits atop the spire is supposed to weigh 12 tonnes.

PARK POBEDY

The Great Patriotic War – as WWII is known in Russia – was a momentous event that is still vivid in the hearts, minds and memories of many Russian citizens. Magnificent Park Pobedy (Парк Победы MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.poklonnaya-gora.ru; Kutuzovsky pr; hdawn-dusk; c; mPark Pobedy) at Poklonnaya Hill is a huge memorial complex commemorating the sacrifice and celebrating the triumph of the war. Unveiled on the 50th anniversary of the victory, the park includes endless fountains, monuments and museums, as well as a memorial church, synagogue and mosque.
The park's centrepiece is the massive Museum of the Great Patriotic War (Центральный музей Великой Отечественной Войны MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.poklonnayagora.ru; ul Bratiev Fonchenko 10; adult/child R300/200; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun Nov-Mar, to 8pm Apr-Oct; mPark Pobedy) with hundreds of exhibits, including dioramas of every major WWII battle the Russians fought in, as well as weapons, photographs, documents and other wartime memorabilia.

The brainchild of Moscow art fairy Darya Zhukova, Garage is one of the capital's hottest modern-art venues. In mid-2015 the museum moved to spectacular new digs in Gorky Park – a derelict Soviet-era building, renovated by the visionary Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. It hosts exhibitions, lectures, films and interactive educational programs, featuring Russian and international artists. A good cafe and a bookstore are also on the premises.
Art Muzeon & Krymskaya NaberezhnayaPUBLIC ART
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mPark Kultury)F
Moscow's answer to London's South Bank, Krymskaya Nab (Crimea Embankment) features wave-shaped street architecture with Scandinavian-style wooden elements, beautiful flowerbeds and a moody fountain, which ejects water randomly from many holes in the ground to the excitement of children and adults alike. It has merged with the Art Muzeon park and its motley collection of Soviet stone idols (Stalin, Sverdlov, a selection of Lenins and Brezhnevs) that were ripped from their pedestals in the post-1991 wave of anti-Soviet feeling.

Moscow's premier venue for 20th-century Russian art, this branch of the Tretyakov Gallery has much more than the typical socialist-realist images of muscle-bound men wielding scythes and busty women milking cows (although there’s that, too). The exhibits showcase avant-garde artists such as Malevich, Kandinsky, Chagall, Goncharova and Popova, as well as nonconformist artists of the 1960s and 1970s who refused to accept the official style.
In the same building, Central House of Artists, also known as TsDKh, is a huge exhibit space used for contemporary-art shows. A number of galleries are also housed here on a permanent basis.

Moscow's youngest monastery, Donskoy was founded in 1591 as the home of the Virgin of the Don icon, now in the Tretyakov Gallery. This icon is credited with the victory in the 1380 battle of Kulikovo; it’s also said that, in 1591, the Tatar Khan Giri retreated without a fight after the icon showered him with burning arrows in a dream.

The headquarters of the Russian Orthodox Church stands behind white fortress walls. On holy days this place seethes with worshippers murmuring prayers, lighting candles and ladling holy water into jugs at the tiny chapel inside the gates. The Danilov Monastery was built in the late 13th century by Daniil, the first Prince of Moscow, as an outer city defence.

WORTH A TRIP
KOLOMENSKOE MUSEUM-RESERVE

Set amid 4 sq km of picturesque parkland, on a bluff above a bend in the Moscow River, Kolomenskoe is an ancient royal country seat and a Unesco World Heritage Site. Shortly after its founding in the 14th century, the village became a favourite destination for the princes of Moscow. The royal estate is now an eclectic mix of churches and gates, as well as other buildings that were added to the complex over the years.
Outside the front gate, overlooking the river, rises Kolomenskoe’s loveliest structure, the quintessentially Russian Ascension Church ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pr Andropova 39; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun; mKolomenskaya). Built between 1530 and 1532 for Grand Prince Vasily III, it probably celebrated the birth of his heir, Ivan the Terrible. An important development in Russian architecture, it reproduced the shapes of wooden churches in brick for the first time.
In the mid-17th century, Tsar Alexey built a palace so fabulous it was dubbed ‘the eighth wonder of the world’. This whimsical building was famous for its mishmash of tent-roofed towers and onion-shaped eaves, all crafted from wood and structured without a single nail. Unfortunately, this legendary building was demolished in 1768 by Catherine the Great. Some 230 years later, a kitschy gingerbread replica (Дворец царя Алексея Михайловича GOOGLE MAP ; pr Andropova 39; R400; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun; mKashirskaya) was built on Kholomenskoes grounds.
Among the old wooden buildings on the grounds is Peter the Great’s cabin, where he lived while supervising ship- and fort-building at Arkhangelsk. The cabin is surrounded by a re-creation of the tsar’s orchards and gardens.

Sanduny is the oldest and most luxurious banya (hot bath) in the city. The Gothic Room is a work of art with its rich woodcarving, while the main shower room has an aristocratic Roman feel to it. There are several classes, as on trains; regulars say that second male top class is actually better than the premium class.

DON'T MISS
TSARITSYNO PALACE

On a wooded hill in far southeast Moscow, Tsaritsyno Palace is a modern-day manifestation of the exotic summer home that Catherine the Great began in 1775, but never finished. For hundreds of years, the palace was little more than a shell, until the Russian government finally decided to finish it in 2007.
Nowadays, the Great Palace is a fantastical building that combines old Russian, Gothic, classical and Arabic styles. Inside, exhibits are dedicated to the history of Tsaritsyno, as well as the life of Catherine the Great. The extensive grounds include some other lovely buildings.
From Orekhovo metro station, walk towards the ponds past an open-air stage, where old folks gather to dance to 1960s tunes in summer, then turn right towards the palace.

2City Walk
Metro Tour: Underground Art

START KOMSOMOLSKAYA
END PARK POBEDY
DISTANCE 18KM, ONE TO TWO HOURS
Every day, as many as seven million people ride the Moscow metro. What’s more, this transport system marries function and form: many of the stations are marble-faced, frescoed, gilded works of art. Take this tour for an overview of Moscow's most interesting and impressive metro stations.
Start at 1Komsomolskaya, where the red line (Sokolnicheskaya liniya) intersects with the Ring line (Koltsevaya liniya). Both stations are named for the youth workers who helped with early construction. In the red line station, look for the Komsomol emblem at the top of the limestone pillars and the majolica-tile panel showing the volunteers hard at work.
From Komsomolskaya, proceed anti-clockwise around the Ring line, getting off at each stop along the way.
Originally named for the nearby MGU Botanical Garden, 2Prospekt Mira features elegant, white-porcelain depictions of figures planting trees, bringing in the harvest and generally living in harmony.
3Novoslobodskaya is enveloped in the art-nouveau artistry of 32 stained-glass panels. Six windows depict the so-called intellectual professions: architect, geographer, agronomist, engineer, artist and musician. At one end of the central hall is the mosaic Peace in the Whole World. The pair of white doves was a later addition to the mosaic, replacing a portrait of Stalin.
At 4Belorusskaya the ceiling mosaics celebrate the culture, economy and history of Russia’s neighbour to the west. The 12 ceiling panels illustrate different aspects of their culture, while the floor pattern reproduces traditional Belarusian ornamentation.
Switch here to the green Zamoskvoretskaya line (where the Belarusian theme continues) and travel south.
5Mayakovskaya is the pièce de résistance of the Moscow metro. The grand-prize winner at the 1938 World’s Fair in New York has an art-deco central hall that’s all pink rhodonite, with slender, steel columns. The inspiring, upward-looking mosaics on the ceiling depict 24 Hours in the Land of the Soviets. This is also one of the deepest stations (33m), which allowed it to serve as an air-raid shelter during WWII.
The decor at 6Teatralnaya follows a theatrical theme. The porcelain figures represent seven of the Soviet republics by wearing national dress and playing musical instruments from their homeland.
Change here to 7Ploshchad Revolyutsii on line three (the dark-blue Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line). This dramatic station is basically an underground sculpture gallery. The life-sized bronze statues represent the roles played by the people during the revolution and in the 'new world' that comes after. Heading up the escalators, the themes are: revolution, industry, agriculture, hunting, education, sport and child rearing. Touch the nose of the border guard’s dog for good luck on exams. Take the dark-blue line heading west.
Shallow 8Arbatskaya was damaged by a German bomb in 1941. The station was closed and a parallel line was built much deeper. Service was restored on the shallow line the following decade, which explains the existence of two Arbatskaya stations (and two Smolenskaya stations, for that matter) on two different lines.
At 250m, Arbatskaya is one of the longest stations. A braided moulding emphasises the arched ceiling, while red marble and detailed ornamentation give the whole station a baroque atmosphere.
At 9Kievskaya, the elegant white-marble hall is adorned with a Kyivan-style ornamental frieze, while the frescoed panels depict farmers in folk costume, giant vegetables and other aspects of the idyllic Ukrainian existence. The fresco at the end of the hall celebrates 300 years of Russian-Ukrainian cooperation. Ironic.
The newer aPark Pobedy opened after the complex at Poklonnaya Gora, which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War. Moscow's deepest metro station it has the longest escalators in the world. The enamel panels at either end of the hall (created by Zurab Tsereteli) depict the victories of 1812 and 1945.
From here you can return to the centre by retracing your ride on the dark-blue line.

MOSCOW FOR CHILDREN

The Russian capital might not seem like an appealing destination for kids, but you’d be surprised. In Moscow, little people will find museums, parks, theatres and even restaurants that cater especially to them.
Sights & Activities
With over 100 parks and gardens, Moscow has plenty of space for children to let off steam. Many have playgrounds, while larger spaces such as Gorky Park and Vorobyovy Gory Nature Preserve rent bicycles, paddle boats and such. There are also plenty of kid-friendly museums, including places such as the Experimentanium (Экспериментаниум MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-789 3658; www.experimentanium.ru; ul Butyrskaya 46/2; adult/child R650/550; h9.30am-7pm Mon-Fri, 10am-8pm Sat & Sun; c; mSavyolovskaya) and Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines.
Most sights and museums offer reduced-rate tickets for children up to 12 or 18 years of age. Kids younger than five are often free of charge. Look out for family tickets.
Eating
Many restaurants host 'children’s parties' on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, offering toys, games, entertainment and supervision for kids while their parents eat.
Restaurants such as Anderson for Pop (Андерсон для Пап MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-753 1601; www.cafe-anderson.ru; Malaya Gruzinskaya ul 15/1; mains R390-620; h9am-11pm Mon-Fri, 10am-11pm Sat & Sun; c; mBarrikadnaya) and Professor Puf have dedicated play areas for children. At Elardzhi, kids frolic in the courtyard with playground and petting zoo.
Entertainment
Children will see hundreds of puppets at the Obraztsov Puppet Museum (Театр и музей кукол Образцова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-699 5373; www.puppet.ru; Sadovaya-Samotechnaya ul 3; hbox office 11am-2.30pm & 3.30-7pm; mTsvetnoy Bulvar), then see them come to life at the attached theatre.
Choose between two acclaimed circuses: Bolshoi Circus on Vernadskogo ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-930 0300; www.greatcircus.ru; pr Vernadskogo 7; tickets R600-3000; hshows 7pm Wed, 1pm & 5pm Sat, 3pm Sun; c; mUniversitet) and Nikulin Circus on Tsvetnoy Bulvar (Цирк Никулина на Цветном бульваре MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-625 8970; www.circusnikulin.ru; Tsvetnoy bul 13; tickets R400-2500; hbox office 11am-2pm & 3-7pm; mTsvetnoy Bulvar). The acrobatics will astound and amaze, while clowns and animal tricks will leave them laughing.
Local legend Natalya Sats founded the Moscow Children's Musical Theatre (Детский Музыкальный театр им. Н.И.Сац MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-120 2515; www.teatr-sats.ru; pr Vernadskogo 5; tickets R500-1500; hbox office noon-7pm; c; mUniversitet) to entertain and educate children with song and dance.
Transport
The metro might be fun for young ones, but be careful during rush hour, when trains and platforms are packed. Both Lingo Taxi and Detskoe Taxi will look out for your children, offering smoke-free cars and child seats upon request.
4Sleeping
Hotels have become more affordable for foreigners, due to the weak rouble, but Moscow is still not a cheap place to sleep. The city is flush with international luxury hotels. A slew of good hostels have opened, and more midrange accommodation is now also appearing, usually in the form of 'mini-hotels'. Prices include the 18% value-added tax (VAT), but not the 5% sales tax, which is charged mainly at luxury hotels.
The following prices refer to a double room with a private bathroom. Breakfast is not included unless otherwise indicated.
€ less than R3000
€€ R3000–15,000
€€€ more than R15,000
AIRPORT ACCOMMODATION

Recommended for transit travellers who need to crash between flights, both these hotels operate free shuttlebuses from their respective airports.
Aerotel Domodedovo (Аэротель Домодедово GOOGLE MAP ; %495-795 3868; www.airhotel.ru; Domodedovo airport; r R5200; paiW) Small but satisfactory rooms, plus a fitness centre and billiards room.

Nothing short of an art nouveau masterpiece, the 1907 Metropol brings an artistic, historic touch to every nook and cranny, from the spectacular exterior to the grand lobby and the individually decorated (but small) rooms.

A rare chance for budget-conscious travellers to stay this close to Red Square, with easy access to the metro and many nearby restaurants. Forty-six small but comfortable rooms are situated on two floors of this residential building. The location can be noisy: it's worth requesting air-con as you'll want to keep your windows closed.

SERVICED APARTMENTS

Some entrepreneurial Muscovites rent out apartments on a short-term basis. Flats are equipped with kitchens and laundry facilities, and they almost always offer wi-fi access. The rental agency usually makes arrangements for the flat to be cleaned every day or every few days. Often, a good-sized flat is available for the price of a hotel room, or less. It is an ideal solution for families or travellers in a small group.
Prices for apartments start at around R5000 per night. Expect to pay more for fully renovated, Western-style apartments. Although there are usually discounts for longer stays, they are not significant, so these services are not ideal for long-term renters.
AMoscow Suites (%495-233 6429; www.moscowsuites.ru; studios from US$100; W) Slick apartments in central locations on Tverskaya or Novy Arbat. Airport pick-up and visa support are included in the price.

A classical edifice fronts the street, but the interior is sleek and sophisticated. The rooms are decorated in a minimalist, modern style – subdued whites and greys punctuated by contrasting coloured drapes and funky light fixtures. Comfort is paramount, with no skimping on luxuries such as heated bathroom floors and down-filled duvets.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-650 1789; www.hotel-amelie.ru; Strastnoy bul 4, str 3, apt 17; r from R5000; W; mChekhovskaya)
Amelie benefits from its superb location right by Pushkinskaya pl – it's unlikely you will find a room much cheaper than this in the vicinity, and it's a very nicely furnished room, too! On the downside, the hotel is a converted apartment, which means shared bathrooms and an unmarked entrance located on per Kozitsky.
Pushkin HotelHOTEL$$
(Отель Пушкин MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-201 0222; http://otel-pushkin.ru; Nastasyinsky per 5 1; r from R4500; aW; mPushkinskaya)
Just off the eponymous square, this hotel strives to fuse 19th-century style with the modern perception of comfort. We'd call it plush, if not for the tiny, B&B-style reception area. There is a restaurant on the premises, but no need to use it since the area is packed with great places to eat and drink.

(Отель Савой MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-620 8500; www.savoy.ru; ul Rozhdestvenka 3; r from R13,000; naWs; mLubyanka)
Built in 1912, the Savoy maintains an atmosphere of tsarist-era privilege for its guests, and is more intimate and affordable than other luxury hotels. All rooms are equipped with marble bathrooms and Italian fittings and furnishings. The state-of-the-art health club includes a glass-domed 20m swimming pool, complete with geysers and cascades to refresh tired bodies.

The entrance to this hostel, hidden in the courtyards amid 19th-century apartment blocks, looks unassuming. However, with over 80 beds, this popular and professionally run place is a major-league player. Dorms, sleeping six to eight, are decorated with psychedelic wall paintings; bunk beds come with body-friendly mattresses, curtains and individual lights, allowing guests to enjoy full autonomy.

It’s hard to find this tiny place – go into the courtyard and look for entrance No 3, where you might spot a computer-printed sign in the 3rd-floor window. Inside is a great welcoming atmosphere, although the place is usually packed. Ten to 12 beds are squeezed into the dorm rooms, plus there are mattresses on the floor if need be.

Not only is this boutique hotel cosy, thoughtfully designed and very centrally located, it also doubles as an art gallery, with original works by Russian 20th-century conceptualist artists adorning the walls. That's in addition to a very tasteful combination of modern and antique furniture. Visitors also rave about the breakfast, which comes fresh from farms near Moscow.
Garden EmbassyHOTEL$$

Occupying one of the iconic Stalinist skyscrapers, the old Leningradskaya Hotel is now part of the Hilton empire. The American chain has maintained the Soviet grandiosity in the lobby, but has updated the rooms with contemporary design and state-of-the-art amenities.

Special for its small size and friendly staff, the Sretenskaya boasts a romantic Russian atmosphere. Rooms have high ceilings and tasteful, traditional decor. This place is particularly welcoming in winter, when you can warm your bones in the sauna, or soak up some sun in the tropical ‘winter garden’.

This tiny 11-room hotel in a graceful 19th-century building is situated on a quiet residential lane. The hallways are lined with plants, and paintings by local artists adorn the walls. Though rooms have old-style bathrooms and faded furniture, this place is a rarity for its intimacy and homely feel.

(Отель Елоховский MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-632 2300; www.elohotel.ru; ul Spartakovskaya 24; s/d R4500/5300; aW; mBaumanskaya)
Admittedly not very central and occupying the top floor of a shopping arcade, this hotel is nevertheless about the best value for money in Moscow. Rooms are painted in soothing colours, complemented by cityscapes of the world's major cities. The coffee machine in the lobby is available 24 hours. Baumanskaya metro and Yelokhovsky Cathedral are a stone's throw away.

This sweet spot offers stylish dorm rooms (if that's not an oxymoron), fully equipped with lockers, individual lights, orthopaedic mattresses and privacy curtains. Exposed brick walls and leather furniture create an attractive shabby-chic atmosphere. Multilingual staff and a super-central locale are added pluses. The only drawback is the lack of a kitchen, but the surrounding streets are packed with eateries.

Located 170m above the city, this place claims to be the world's first and only skyscraper hostel. What does this mean for you? An incredible panoramic city view from the common area. Rooms are furnished with sturdy wooden bunks, desks and lockers. Service is excellent, with breakfast and laundry included in the price.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-777 0052; www.cityhotelgroup.ru; Bldg 3, Bolshaya Bronnaya ul 23; d from R6800; paW; mPushkinskaya)
Steps from the hustle and bustle of Tverskaya, this is a delightfully stylish hotel tucked into a quiet courtyard off the Boulevard Ring. Situated on the lower floors, the rooms do not get much natural light, but they feature king-sized beds, whirlpool tubs and elegant design. Service is consistently friendly. Prices drop on weekends, offering terrific value.

The location on trendy Bolshaya Nikitskaya is prime, and prices are unbeatable, so you'll forgive the side-street entrance and the fact that rooms can be rented by the hour. It's actually a perfectly respectable place, with spotless rooms, pleasant decor and helpful staff. The cheapest rooms are tiny, so unless you're travelling solo, you'll probably want to upgrade.

Now operated by Starwood Resorts, this 1903 beauty occupies a prime location at the base of Tverskaya ul, just across from Alexander Garden. As such, some rooms have magnificent views of the Kremlin (worth the extra roubles). Original artwork lines the walls and antique-style furnishings grace the premises. The rooms themselves are classically luxurious.

This place exudes (and requires) good vibes, with its wacky and wonderful mural-painted walls and pillow-strewn 'lounge zone'. Dorm beds are actually little 'pods' with shades that ensure complete privacy. Lockers, kitchen and laundry facilities are available. Get the door code before you show up.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-229 8018; www.bulgakovhotel.com; ul Arbat 49; s/d from R3600/4000; niW; mSmolenskaya)
The classy rooms, graced with high ceilings and Master and Margarita inspired art, are as good as it gets in Moscow for this price, especially considering the primo location. The bathrooms are tiny but they are private. Enter the courtyard from Plotnikov per and use entrance No 2.

Live next door to Leo Tolstoy at this new boutique hotel, in a building dating from 1866. Both service and style are simple but quite delightful. Some of the 38 rooms have exposed brick walls or loft-style ceilings. Outside the Garden Ring, this neighbourhood is still pretty lively, with a number of restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity.

(Гостиница Меркурий Арбат MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-225 0025; www.mercure.com; Smolenskaya pl 6; r from R6200; naW; mSmolenskaya)
We're charmed by this sweet and stylish hotel. Rooms are attractive and rather plush to boot. The most affordable ones have two twins or one queen-size bed, plus work space, flat-screen TVs and chic bathrooms with basin sinks. It's surprisingly quiet for its location right on the Garden Ring. Excellent value, especially on weekends.

With 15 rooms in an exquisite art deco building, the Russo Balt is as intimate and elegant as it gets in Moscow. Standard rooms are on the small side, but the whole place is beautifully decorated with period furnishings and original artwork, with the utmost attention to detail. Highly recommended.

(Гостиница Украина MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-221 5555; www.radissonblu.com; Kutuzovsky pr 2/1; r from R11,700; naWs; mKievskaya)
Housed in one of Stalin's 'Seven Sisters', this bombastic beauty sits majestically on the banks of the Moscow River facing the White House. It has retained its old-fashioned ostentation, with crystal chandeliers, polished marble and a ceiling fresco in the lobby. Heavy drapes, textured wallpaper and reproduction antiques give the guest rooms a similar atmosphere – with all the modern amenities.

This very small hostel is located in a converted flat with a comfy (we'd even say intimate) common area in the building best identified by Illarion cafe, just off Pyatnitskaya ul. Apart from the dorms, it features four doubles – two regular and two with bunk beds.
TroikaHOTEL$$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-204 2226; www.hoteltroyka.ru; Sadovnicheskaya ul 5; r from R4000; a; mNovokuznetskaya)

This very regular branch of the Park Inn chain – think slightly impersonal, predictable comforts – boasts a prime location within walking distance of the Kremlin and the Red October cluster of bars and galleries. Prices fall to a jaw-dropping low in the middle of summer.
Na KazachyemHOTEL$$
(На Казачьем MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-745 2190; 1-y Kazachy per 4; s/d from R7600/8600; naWs; mPolyanka)
Set in the historic heart of Zamoskvorechie, Na Kazachyem recreates the atmosphere of an 18th-century estate. The light-filled atrium, bedecked with a crystal chandelier, and 15 classically decorated rooms provide a perfect setting for old-fashioned Russian hospitality. Reduced rates on weekends.

This comfy, cosy hotel has only 27 rooms, including three that are tucked up under the mansard roof. The rooms are simply decorated, but parquet floors and comfortable queen-sized beds rank it above the standard post-Soviet fare. Add in attentive service and a central location (convenient for the Aeroexpress Train to Domodedovo Airport), and you’ve got an excellent-value accommodation option.

If you want to wake up to views of the sun glinting off the Kremlin’s golden domes, this luxurious property on the Moscow River is the place for you. It is a historic hotel, built in 1898, with 230 high-ceilinged rooms that are sophisticated and sumptuous in design.
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
STALIN'S SEVEN SISTERS

The foundations for seven large skyscrapers were laid in 1947 to mark Moscow’s 800th anniversary. Stalin had decided that Moscow suffered from a ‘skyscraper gap’ when compared to the USA, and ordered the construction of these seven behemoths to jump-start the city’s skyline.
One of the main architects, Vyacheslav Oltarzhevsky, had worked in New York during the skyscraper boom of the 1930s, and his experience proved essential. (Fortunately, he’d been released from the Gulag in time to help.)
In addition to the ‘Seven Sisters’ listed here, there were plans in place to build an eighth Stalinist skyscraper in Zaryadye (near Kitay Gorod). The historic district was razed in 1947 and a foundation was laid for a 32-storey tower. It did not get any further than that – for better and for worse – and the foundation was later used for the gargantuan Hotel Rossiya (demolished in 2006). This is now the site of the new Park Zaryadye.
With their widely scattered locations, the towers provide a unique visual reference for Moscow. Their official name in Russia is vysotky (high-rise) as opposed to neboskryob (foreign skyscraper). They have been nicknamed variously the ‘Seven Sisters’, the ‘wedding cakes’, ‘Stalin’s sisters’ and more.

5Eating
In recent years Moscow has blossomed into a culinary capital. Foodies will be thrilled by the dining options, from old-fashioned haute-russe to contemporary 'author cuisine'. The ban on imported foodstuffs means that chefs are finding innovative ways to utilise local ingredients, rediscovering ancient cooking techniques and inventing new ones in the process. And Moscow diners are eating it up. Literally.
COOK LIKE A LOCAL

Newly minted, this old-style cafeteria offers a nostalgic recreation of dining in post-Stalinist Russia. The food is good – and cheap for such a fancy store. Meat cutlets and cold salads come highly recommended. This is a great place to try ‘herring in a fur coat’ (herring, beetroots, carrots and potatoes).

This place has the same overpriced but appetising fare as other outlets of the ubiquitous chain, but the fabulous 'grand cafe' interior makes this one a special experience. Marble floors, art deco chandeliers and elaborate latticework evoke another era. Efficient service and excellent atmosphere.

Sip a cappuccino in view of the Kremlin. Munch on lunch while the crowds line up at Lenin’s Mausoleum. Enjoy an afternoon aperitif while admiring St Basil’s domes. Service is lacking and the menu is overpriced, but this cafe on the 1st floor of the GUM mall is the only place to sit right on Red Square and marvel at its magnificence.
The menu is wide-ranging, so you don't have to spend a fortune. Reservations recommended for dinner.

Among myriad Georgian places in Moscow, Batoni is about the loveliest and the most scrupulous at sourcing all the right ingredients for century-old recipes. Pkhali (walnut paste) snacks, khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread) and lamb shashlyk kebabs are all up to Mt Kazbek–high standards. For a proper taste of Georgia, order a bottle of Mukuzani or Kindzmarauli – the country's best reds.

Designed to look like a transplant from some old-worldish European city, this unpretentious eatery is run by local celebrity chef Uilliam Lamberti. The minimalist menu includes soups, bruschettas and salads. At first glance, the place seems to consist of one long table, but there is more seating downstairs. Takeaway is available.

This cosy place touts itself as ‘the most visited boutique’ in the flashy Stoleshnikov per, but instead of Armani clothes it celebrates arguably the most vital item on any Russian menu – pelmeni (dumplings), as well as their relatives from all around the world. Perfectly shaped, the dumplings seem fit for a catwalk display in Milan and taste even better.

This quirky place, a cross between a corner shop and a hip falafel joint, also makes top-quality shawarma (grilled meat and salad wrapped in flat bread) in the fashionably open kitchen. The shop section has a good selection of Israeli vegetable preserves, fruit and wine.

The two upper floors of Tsvetnoy Central Market shopping mall are filled with refined delis and cafes, some of them outstandingly good. Little snacks hailing from Basque Country in Spain have generated a bit of a cult following for Tapas & Pintxos, on the 5th floor. The Dagestani dumpling shop on the 6th floor makes for equally exciting culinary travel.

The affable and chatty owners of this place travel the world and experiment with the menu a lot, turning burgers, pizzas and pasta into artfully constructed objects of modern culinary art. The other source of joy is a cabinet filled with bottles of ripening fruity liquors, which may destroy your budget if consumed uncontrollably (a pointless warning, we know).

Welcome to the Russian Portlandia – all the food here is organic and hails from little farms where you may rest assured all the lambs and chickens lived a very happy life before being served to you on a plate. Irony aside, this is a great place to sample local food cooked in a funky improvisational style.

Fresh out of Canada, this is the kind of vegetarian restaurant that people pour into not for lifestyle reasons, but because the modern, postethnic food and the escapist ambience are great. Definitely go for the smoothies. Vegans and rawists will not feel neglected.
VoronezhINTERNATIONAL$$
(Воронеж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.voronej.com; ul Bolshaya Dmitrovka 12/1, str 1; mains R300-720; h9am-9pm; mTeatralnaya)
Its darkened, scarlet-coloured interior makes this bistro look a bit like an oriental opium den, but it is in fact a carnivore temple, where patrons seem to fall into a deeply meditative state while munching on their burgers and excellent pastrami sandwiches. One of the best places for lunch in the city centre.

Filling up with white collars from the business centre above it, this trendsetting establishment combines unlikely ingredients and cooking methods with unfailingly excellent results – just try its smoked-mussel soup or dorado cooked with sorrel. Visual art is also involved, with each dish designed to entertain the eye as much as to please the stomach.

You'll find a pleasant mix of post-industrial and theatrical in this dimly lit space, where low-hanging chandeliers and comfortable chairs make for a long and enjoyable evening. The menu mirrors the city outside – inventively cosmopolitan with a sprinkle of Soviet nostalgia and a strong bias towards domestic meat and vegetable producers.

Casual, friendly and focused on taste, rather than trying to impress with shocking exoticism, Technicum is one of the places that shape the modern outlook of Moscow's culinary scene. The laconic menu contains a short list of fish and meat dishes (note the outstanding mutton with aubergine) as well as soups, including an exemplary borsch (beetroot soup) served with Borodinsky rye bread.

Moscow's most venerated and erudite restaurateur Alexander Rappoport shares his love for regional French cuisine in this classy and expensive place on Kuznetsky most. The menu is a grand gastrotour taking in seemingly every major area of France from Brittany to Alsace. Authenticity is religion here.

Druzhba earns high marks for authenticity, and as far as Sichuan cuisine goes that means spicy. Chinese restaurants in Moscow are notorious for turning down their seasoning to appeal to Russian taste buds, but Druzhba is the exception, which explains why this place is often packed with Chinese patrons. The chicken with peppers gets red-hot reviews.

It's a blessing when one of the most revered Georgian eateries in town is also one of the cheapest. The object of worship here is khinkali – large, meat-filled dumplings – but the traditional vegie starters are also great. The rather inevitable downside is that the place is constantly busy and there is often a queue to get in.

The vast majority of Georgian restaurants focus on the most popular, tried-and-true fare, such as shashlyk (meat kebabs) and khinkali (dumplings). This classy place goes far beyond these, listing less well-known delicacies with almost encyclopaedic meticulousness. Our favourite is chakapuli (lamb cooked in white wine with tarragon) and megreli kharcho (duck in walnut sauce).

Ignore the fact that the waiting staff are dressed as Mao's soldiers; this is the place to try outstanding Cantonese fare in an atmosphere echoing that of the Opium War's decadence. A true culinary magician, the Chinese chef turns any ingredient – from hog paw to octopus to simple milk – into a mouth-watering delicacy.

Come here to celebrate Odessa, affectionately called 'mama' by the residents of this port city. What mama cooks is a wild fusion of Jewish, Ukrainian and Balkan foods, with a strong emphasis on Black Sea fish. It's like island hopping – from forshmak (Jewish herring pate) to Ukrainian borsch and eventually to fried Odessa gobies.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-926 1640; www.facebook.com/yuzhanemsk/; pr Akademika Sakharova 10; mains R450-1300; hnoon-midnight; mKrasnye Vorota)
A carnivore stronghold, Yuzhane (which means 'the Southerners') gets its meat from the Kuban area in southern Russia, hence the name. The chef's philosophy is to utilise every bit of an animal's body, so in addition to juicy steaks, the menu features all kinds of by-products. The southern theme is backed by seafood and a wealth of vegetables, including meaty tomatoes.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-775 2601; www.madamgalife.ru; Pr Mira 26/1; mains R430-850; hnoon-5am; W; mProspekt Mira)
A brainchild of famous Georgian film director Rezo Gabriadze, this is much more than just another Caucasian restaurant. It faces the charming Aptekarsky Ogorod gardens for starters, and the interior design – combining naive art with antiques brought from Georgia – is superb. Food is a mixture of Georgian and European. To avoid disappointment, stick to the former.

oStolleCAFE$
(Штолле MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.stolle.ru; Bldg 1, Bolshaya Sadovaya ul 3; mains R200-400; h8am-11pm; aWc; mMayakovskaya)
The entire menu at Stolle is excellent, but the pirozhki (savoury pies) are irresistible. A ‘stolle’ is a traditional Saxon Christmas cake: the selection of sweets and savouries sits on the counter, fresh from the oven. It may be difficult to decide (mushroom or meat, apricot or apple?), but you really can’t go wrong.

The queue often runs out the door, as loyal patrons wait their turn for the city’s best freshly baked breads, pastries and pies. It’s worth the wait, especially if you decide on a fruit-filled croissant or to-die-for olive bread. Next door there are big wooden tables where you can get large bowls of coffee or tea.
oTwinsRUSSIAN$$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-695 4510; www.twinsmoscow.ru; Malaya Bronnaya ul 13; mains R650-1750; Wv; mTverskaya)
Swoon-worthy identical-twin chefs Sergei and Ivan Berezutskiy bring their contrasting tastes and creative talents to this delightful restaurant. The brothers take a thoroughly modern approach to Russian cooking, with ingredients procured from all corners of the country. Seating is on the pleasant terrace or in the classy, kitschy dining room.

Unassuming, affordable and appetising, this urban cafe exemplifies what people love about Georgian culture: the warm hospitality and the freshly baked khachapuri (cheese bread). Aside from eight types of delicious khachapuri, there’s also an array of soups, shashlyk (kebabs), khinkali (dumplings) and other Georgian favourites.

An excellent breakfast choice before visiting the Kremlin, this round-the-clock place mixes Soviet nostalgia with a great deal of mischievous irony in both design and food. The chef has upgraded the menu of a standard pioneer camp’s canteen to near-haute-cuisine level, with masterfully cooked porridge, pancakes, vareniki (boiled dumplings, like ravioli) and cottage-cheese pies.

The tsarina of haute-russe dining, offering an exquisite blend of Russian and French cuisines. Service and food are done to perfection. The lovely 19th-century building has a different atmosphere on each floor, including a richly decorated library and a pleasant rooftop cafe.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.varenichnaya.ru; ul Arbat 29; business lunch R290-340, mains R220-490; h10am-midnight; vc; mArbatskaya)
Retro Soviet is all the rage in Moscow, and this old-style restaurant does it right, with books lining the walls, old movies on the B&W TV, and Cold War–era prices. The menu features tasty, filling vareniki and pelmeni (Russian-style dumplings), with sweet and savoury fillings. Bonus: an excellent house-made pickled vegie plate to make you pucker.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-999-003 0030; www.usachevsky.ru; ul Usachyova 26; mains R200-600; h9am-9pm; mSportivnaya)
An old market has been taken over by hipster foodies, who instantly filled the premises with little eateries serving Georgian, Uzbek, Italian, Israeli and you-name-it cuisine, as well as shops representing small-scale Russian food producers, such as Kostroma Cheese. It’s a great place for lunch and shopping, if you happen to be nearby.

A select menu of Russian classics shows off fresh ingredients, old-fashioned cooking methods and contemporary flare. Pleasant, efficient service and a super-central location make this a great option before or after a morning at the museum. Unfortunately named, but otherwise delightful, especially the house-made bread and pastries.

(Эларджи MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-627 7897; www.ginza.ru; Gagarinsky per 15a; mains R600-800; hnoon-midnight; c; mKropotkinskaya)
Moscow's Georgian restaurants are all very tasty, but this one is also tasteful. You'll be charmed from the moment you enter the courtyard, where live rabbits and lambs greet all comers. Sink into a sofa in the romantic dining room or on the light-filled porch; then feast on delicacies, such as the namesake dish, elarji (cornmeal with suluguni cheese).
oChemodanRUSSIAN$$$
(Чемодан MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-695 3819; www.chemodan-msk.ru; Gogolevsky bul 25; mains R900-1950; av; mKropotkinskaya)
A unique opportunity to sample Siberian cuisine (rare, that is, for those of us who don't frequent Siberia). The menu highlights game meat, regional seafood and wild fruits and berries (and pine cones). The dining room is decorated with old photos and antiques, creating a romantic atmosphere that any adventurer would be happy to return home to. Highly recommended.

A baby of the recent Israeli food craze, this restaurant-cum-bar hides in an atmospheric vaulted cellar decorated with Judaic and Masonic symbols. The talented chef's wild imagination turns Jewish standards, such as gefilte fish (stuffed carp), into art objects fit for the fusion cuisine of the future. There are great cocktails, too.

Georgian restaurants in Moscow tend to be either expensive or tacky. This small family-run place is neither. Come with friends and order a selection of appetisers, such as pkhali and lobio (both made of walnut paste), khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread) and kharcho (rice with beef or lamb soup). Bless you if you can still accommodate a main course after all that!

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-909-955 4043; www.facebook.com/acdcintbilisi; Gorky Park; mains R250-350; h10am-10pm; mOktyabrskaya)
Burgers and Georgia (the one in the Caucasus) seem to inhabit parallel universes, but they get together in this summer-only Gorky Park kiosk. An otherwise very ordinary burger turns Georgian with the help of hot adjika sauce and suluguni cheese. The meatballs in satsivi (walnut, garlic and pomegranate paste) are another thing to try here.
oDanilovsky MarketMARKET$$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.danrinok.ru; Mytnaya ul 74; mains R400-600; h8am-8pm; mTulskaya)
A showcase of the area's ongoing gentrification, this giant Soviet-era farmers market is now largely about deli food cooked and served in myriad little eateries, including such gems as a Dagestani dumpling shop and a Vietnamese pho-soup kitchen. The market itself looks very orderly, if a tiny bit artificial, with uniformed vendors and thoughtfully designed premises.

(Федя, дичь! MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-916-747 0110; Mytnaya ul 74; mains R650-820; h11am-11pm; mTulskaya)
Let's take a walk on the wild side of the Moscow food scene. This place gets fresh supplies of fish and game from faraway corners of Siberia. Sea of Japan oysters and Arctic fish tartare are fresh and delicious despite crossing eight time zones to land on your table; so are wild-boar cutlets and deer steaks with forest berries.

Domestic cheese production is all the rage in Russia, which has banned cheese imports from the EU in retaliation for Western sanctions. This restaurant serves hearty, homey meals, most of which contain cheese produced right here – in a micro-creamery that you see first thing after coming inside. A shop selling top-quality cheese is also on the premises.

This place illustrates the direction in which the entire Moscow restaurant scene seems to be heading – a bistro-cum-bar that would not be out of place in somewhere like Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin. The subdued, wood-dominated decor is almost therapeutic and the inventive, postethnic food makes you want to live or work in the vicinity, just so it can be your local.
The R550 set-lunch deal is about the best value for money in town. The place is a good breakfast choice, too.
oBjörnSCANDINAVIAN$$$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-953 9059; http://bjorn.rest; Pyatnitskaya ul 3; mains R600-1200; mNovokuznetskaya)
A neat cluster of fir trees on a busy street hides a Nordic gem that deserves a saga to glorify its many virtues. This is not an ‘ethnic’ restaurant, but a presentation of futuristic Scandinavian cuisine straight out of a science fiction movie. From salads to desserts, every dish looks deceptively simple, visually perfect and 23rd century.
6Drinking & Nightlife
Solo traveller looking for drinking buddies? Freaked out by face control? An organised pub crawl is a guaranteed way to meet fine folks from around the world, get into some cool clubs and discover Moscow's nightlife. The City Pub Crawl (www.citypubcrawl.ru; R1500) includes four clubs, four drinks and one band of very merry Moscow travellers. Dancing on the bar is also included.
FACE CONTROL

‘Face control’ is the common practice of denying entry to clubs and bars based on a person’s appearance. It’s not unusual for nightlife hot spots to try to create an illusion of exclusivity, but some Moscow clubs take the practice to a new level.
A few tips for avoiding rejection:
ADress sharp. No shorts, sneakers or sportswear.
ASmile. Show the bouncer that you are going to enhance the atmosphere inside.
ABook a table (sometimes requires a table deposit).
ASpeak English. Foreigners are not as special as they used to be, but they’re still sort of special.

Dining, drinking and dancing are all on offer in this sexy space. There is a long menu of Pan Asian cuisine – as well as sushi, pasta, tapas and more – served all night long for Moscow's nonstop party people. Drinks are forgettable and service is slack, but everything (and everyone) looks fine – and sometimes that's what matters.

There is little to say about this misleadingly unassuming bar, apart from the fact that everything in it is close to perfection. It has it all – prime location, convivial atmosphere, eclectic DJ music, friendly bartenders and superb drinks. Though declared 'the best' by various magazines on several occasions, it doesn't feel like they care.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-905-703 3205; www.veranda3205.ru; ul Karetny Ryad 3; h11am-3am; mPushkinskaya)
The biggest drinking and eating establishment in Hermitage Gardens, this verandah positioned at the back of the park's main building looks a bit like a greenhouse. In summer, tables (and patrons) spill out into the park, making it one of the city's best places for outdoor drinking. With its long bar and joyful atmosphere, the place also heaves in winter.
EnthusiastBAR
(Энтузиаст MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Stoleshnikov per 7, str 5; hnoon-11pm Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri & Sat; mTeatralnaya)
Scooter enthusiast, that is. But you don't have to be one in order to enjoy this superbly laid-back bar hidden at the far end of a fancifully shaped courtyard and disguised as a spare-parts shop. On a warm day, grab a beer or cider, settle into a beach chair and let harmony descend on you.

oSisters CafeCAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-623 0932; www.cafesisters.com; ul Pokrovka 6; hnoon-11pm; W; mKitay-Gorod)
This cosy and quiet cafe-cum-bar has a distinct feminine touch about it – as if Chekhov's sisters have finally made their way to Moscow and started a new life here. Cheapish smoothies, lemonades and teas are on offer, but the wine and cocktail lists are equally impressive.
oUkuleleshnayaBAR

In its new location, this is now more of a bar than a musical instrument shop, although ukuleles still adorn the walls, prompting an occasional jam session. Craft beer prevails on the drinks list, but Ukuleleshnaya also serves experimental cocktails of its own invention. Live concerts happen regularly and resident Pomeranian spitz Berseny (cute dog) presides over the resulting madness.
Chaynaya VysotaTEAHOUSE
(Чайная высота MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://cha108.ru/; ul Pokrovka 27 str 1; W; mChistye Prudy)
Tearoom? Gelateria? This place looks more like an academic library of tea and ice cream, an impression enhanced by it sharing premises with a bookstore. The tea menu is an endless list of pu'ers and oolongs, while ice-cream flavours represent everything that grows in the former USSR – from gooseberry or fir-needle juice to chestnuts and Crimean rose petals.
Tsurtsum CafeCAFE
(Цурцум кафе MAP GOOGLE MAP ; 4-y Syromyatnichesky per 1 str 6; h10am-11pm)
Synonymous with Winzavod art centre, where it is located, Tsurtsum is a watering hole where all the beasts of the postindustrial savannah at the back of Kursky vokzal gather to sit on the verandah and plot new start-ups, performances and revolutions. Great for people-watching and nonmalicious, self-educating eavesdropping – if you speak Russian.
SolyankaCAFE, CLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-903-745 1313; http://s-11.ru; ul Solyanka 11; h11am-6am; W; mKitay-Gorod)
Solyanka is a historic 18th-century merchant’s mansion that has been revamped into an edgy, arty club. Wide-plank floors, exposed brick walls, leather furniture and funky light fixtures transform the space. By day it’s an excellent restaurant, serving contemporary, creative Russian and European food.
In the evening, the big bar room gets cleared of tables and the DJ spins hip-hop, techno and rave. The music usually starts at 11pm (and so does the face control).

How often do you head to a cafe just because you need somewhere nice to spend some time in, not because you are desperate to get a coffee? Tsiferblat was the first establishment in Moscow that turned the idea of a coffee shop upside down. Here you pay for time, while coffee, as well as lemonade and cookies, are free.
They call it an 'anticafe'. Looking like an old flat, this place is good for chatting with friends or for fiddling with your gadgets, but it might be slightly too noisy if you need to do some real work. Enter at the back of the building, then walk to the 2nd floor.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.jaggercity.ru; Bldg 30, Rochdelskaya ul 15; hnoon-midnight Mon-Wed, to 6am Thu-Sat, 2pm-midnight Sun; mUlitsa 1905 Goda)
Tucked into the courtyard in the old Tryokhgornaya manufacturing complex, Jagger is a super-hot bar with a super-cool vibe. Excellent cocktails, sharp clientele and laid-back atmosphere are characteristic of a new Moscow nightlife that is cosmopolitan and cultured, not over-the-top outrageous. Still, you have to know where to look for this place. And you have to look good.
Coffee ManiaCAFE
(Кофемания MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.coffeemania.ru; Bolshaya Nikitskaya ul 13, Moscow Conservatory; h24hr; W; mOkhotny Ryad)

Eclectic and atmospheric, Dom 12 may be the perfect place to attend an event or chat with friends over a glass of wine. The cosy interior is enhanced by natural materials, comfy chairs and low lighting. Besides the excellent wine list, the place offers poetry nights, lectures, concerts and dancing. Delightful!

(Пивной зал Жигули MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.zhiguli.su; ul Novy Arbat 11; beer R210-350; h10am-2am Sun-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; W; mArbatskaya)
It’s hard to classify this old-style stolovaya (cafeteria) that happens to brew great beer. The place harks back to the Soviet years, when a popular pivnaya (beer joint with stand-up tables) with the same name was a Novy Arbat institution. The minimalist decor and cafeteria-style service recalls the heyday, although it's been updated with big-screen TVs and a separate table-service dining room.

Located just below the Patriarshy most, the bar-restaurant at the Strelka Institute is the ideal starting point for an evening in the Red October complex. The rooftop terrace has unbeatable Moscow River views, but the interior is equally cool in a shabby-chic sort of way. The bar menu is excellent and there is usually somebody tinkling the ivories.

Euphoria reigns in this postmodern nomad camp of a bar with its strategic rooftop position on Red October. The decor is bright-coloured kitsch, which among other oddities means fake palm trees and toilet doors covered with artificial fur. The DJ and live-music repertoires are aptly eclectic.
Le BouleBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-518 8412; Gorky Park; hnoon-midnight; W; mOktyabrskaya)
The goatee and moustache factor is high in this hipster-ridden verandah bar that comes with a dozen pétanque lanes. Grab a pitcher of sangria or a pint of cider and have a go at what is arguably the most alcohol-compatible sport. Live bands often play on the verandah in the early evening.

This Shabolovka district local is an alcohol-infused version of the Mad Hatter's tea party with a hint of BDSM. It features waitresses dressed as paramedics and policewomen, cocktails served in drip bags and a table inside a prison cell, where you can handcuff your drinking buddies if that sounds like a fun thing to do.

'Parka' is a banya (bathhouse) term, hence the sauna-like decor, and just like a proper banya, this a very relaxing place. The friendly bartenders let you try any beer before you commit to buying a pint; the brews, many with crazy Runglish names, are mostly local.

The performing arts are one of Moscow’s biggest attractions. Highly acclaimed, professional artists stage productions in elegant theatres around the city, most of which have been recently revamped and look marvellous.
Most theatres sell tickets online. Or, you can do it the old-fashioned way and buy tickets directly from the theatre box office or from a teatralnaya kassa (theatre kiosk), several of which are scattered about the city. Note, many venues are closed between late June and early September.

An evening at the Bolshoi is still one of Moscow’s most romantic and entertaining options for a night on the town.

If you have ever visited Pirogi’s earlier incarnations, you might be surprised by the club’s slick storefront. Inside, it’s not dark and it’s not grungy. Do not fear, however, as the crucial elements have not changed: decent food, affordable beer, and movies and music every night, all of which draw the young, broke and beautiful.

7Shopping
News flash: Moscow is an expensive city. So don’t come looking for bargains. Do come looking for creative and classy clothing and jewellery by local designers; an innovative art scene; high-quality handicrafts, linens, glassware and folk art; and unusual souvenirs that you won’t find anywhere else.
Excellent shopping streets include the famous ul Arbat, crammed with souvenir stalls; swanky ul Petrovka, with its nearby pleasant pedestrian lanes; and charming Nikolskaya ul, terminating at the gated fashion fantasy world inside Tretyakovsky proezd.
The city’s new contemporary-art centres house art galleries, as well as performance and studio space, clubs, cafes and other creative enterprises. Here, you can see the works of many artists under one roof (or at least in one block).

IZMAYLOVO

Never mind the kitschy mock Kremlin that surrounds it, Izmaylovsky Market ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kremlin-izmailovo.com; Izmaylovskoye sh 73; h10am-8pm; mPartizanskaya) is the ultimate place to shop for matryoshka dolls, military uniforms, icons, Soviet badges, and some real antiques. Huge and diverse, it is almost a theme park, with shops, cafes and a couple of not terribly exciting museums.
Serious antiquarians occupy the 2nd floor of the wooden trade row surrounding the palace, but for really good stuff you need to come here at an ungodly hour on Saturday morning and compete with pros from Moscow galleries. Keep in mind that Russia bans the export of any item older than 100 years. Feel free to negotiate, but don’t expect vendors to come down more than 10%. This place is technically open every day, but many vendors come out only on weekends, when the selection is greater.

8Getting There & Away
AIR
Most travellers arrive in Moscow by air, flying into one of the city’s four international airports:
Sheremetyevo (Шереметьево GOOGLE MAP ; %495-578 6565; www.svo.aero) 30km northwest of the city centre, this is Moscow's busiest airport. The Aeroexpress Train makes the 35-minute trip between Sheremetyevo (located next to Terminal E) and Belorussky vokzal every half-hour from 5.30am to 12.30am.
Domodedovo (Домодедово GOOGLE MAP ; %495-933 6666; www.domodedovo.ru) About 48km south of the city is the city’s most efficient international airport. The Aeroexpress Train leaves Paveletsky vokzal every half-hour between 6am and midnight for the 45-minute trip to Domodedovo.
Vnukovo (Внуково GOOGLE MAP ; %495-937 5555; www.vnukovo.ru) About 30km southwest of the city centre, this airport mostly has flights to/from the Caucasus, Moldova and Kaliningrad, as well as domestic flights and a smattering of flights to Europe. The Aeroexpress Train makes the 35-minute run from Kievsky vokzal to Vnukovo airport every hour from 6am to 11pm.
Zhukovsky (Жуковский GOOGLE MAP ; %495-228 9600; http://zia.aero) Opened in 2016, Moscow's fourth international airport is about 40km southeast of the city. It mostly serves Central Asian destinations, and is a hub for Ural Airlines.
BOAT
There are numerous cruise boats plying the routes between Moscow and St Petersburg, most stopping at Uglich, Yaroslavl, Goritsky Monastery, Kizhi and Mondrogy (near Lake Ladoga). Ships are similar in quality and size, carrying about 250 passengers.
BUS
Bus service may be useful for destinations that are not served by train. The central bus station (Центральный автовокзал, Щёлковский автовокзал GOOGLE MAP ; %499-748 8029; www.avtovokzaly.ru; mShchyolkovskaya), sometimes called Shchyolkovsky bus station, is located 8km east of the city centre. Long-distance buses travel to Ivanovo (R750, 5½ hours, eight daily), Kyiv (R1600, 16 hours, 3.45pm), Minsk (R1100, 12 hours, 6.40pm), Nizhny Novgorod (R900, six hours, three daily) via Vladimir (R400, 3½ hours), Plyos (R850, seven hours, 6pm) and Yuryev-Polsky (R450, four hours, four daily). It’s advisable to book ahead, especially for travel on weekends.
CAR & MOTORCYCLE
Driving in and around Moscow is difficult, to say the least, due to massive traffic jams, challenging navigation and shortages of parking. That said, you may wish to hire a car if you are leaving the city, eg taking a day trip to sites around Moscow or driving around the Golden Ring.
TRAIN
Rail riders will arrive at one of Moscow's central train stations, all with easy access to the metro. Most taxi companies offer a fixed rate of R400 to R600 for a train station transfer.
Stations
Belarus Station (Белорусский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://belorussky.dzvr.ru; Tverskaya Zastava pl; W; mBelorusskaya) has trains to/from northern and central Europe, as well as suburban trains to/from the west, including Mozhaysk and Borodino.

TRAINS CONNECTING MOSCOW & ST PETERSBURG

All trains to St Petersburg depart from Leningrad Station. Book your tickets at any train station or through your hotel. Alternatively, buy tickets online at the official site of the Russian railroad (www.rzd.ru).
Overnight
There are about a dozen overnight trains connecting the cities. Most depart between 10pm and 1am, arriving the following morning between 6am and 8am. On the more comfortable firmeny trains, a 1st-class SV ticket (two-person cabin) costs R5500 to R7000, while a 2nd-class kupe (four-person cabin) is R3000 to R4000.
Sample departure times and fares:
2 Krasnaya Strela 1st-/2nd-class R7000/3600, eight hours, 11.55pm
4 Ekspress 1st-/2nd-class R5300/3400, nine hours, 11.30pm

54 Grand Express 1st-/2nd-class R6600/3840, nine hours, 11.40pm
Sapsan
Travelling at speeds of 200km/h Sapsan trains connect the cities in about four hours or less. Trains depart throughout the day. Comfortable seats cost R3500 to R4500.
8Getting Around
Most visitors won't need anything but Moscow's super-efficient metro system, which allows you to get to pretty much anywhere in the city without thinking about complicated bus or tram routes. Connecting to the metro, an overground railway ring line (Moscow Central Ring) circles the city, which may be useful for some sights on the outskirts.
TO/FROM THE AIRPORTS
The three main airports – not yet including Zhukovsky – are accessible by the convenient Aeroexpress Train (%8-800-700 3377; www.aeroexpress.ru; one way R420; h6am-midnight) from the city centre; reduced rates are available for online purchases. Alternatively, order an official airport taxi from the dispatcher's desk in the terminal (R2000 to R2500 to the city centre). You can save some cash by booking in advance to take advantage of the fixed rates offered by most companies (usually from R1500 to R1800 to/from any airport). Driving times vary wildly depending on the traffic.
CITY TRANSPORT TICKETS

Moscow has a unified ticketing system. All tickets are essentially smart cards that you must tap on the reader at the turnstiles before entering a metro station or on the bus.
Most convenient for short-term visitors is the red Ediny (Единый) ticket, which is good for all kinds of transport and available at metro stations. Depending on your time and logistics, you can choose between buying a ticket good for a single trip for R55, two trips for R110, 20 trips for R720, 40 trips for R1440 or 60 trips for R1700.
If you are staying in Moscow for more than a few days, it is recommended that you get a Troika (Тройка) top-up card, also available at metro stations. It works on all kinds of transport and gives a slightly cheaper rate than Ediny.
If your accommodation warrants taking a bus or tram to the nearest metro station, you may consider buying a 90 Minutes card (single trip R65), which includes one metro ride and an unlimited number of bus/tram/trolleybus rides.
Another ticket type is TAT, which is only good for trams, buses and trolleybuses, but it is of little use for most visitors.
BICYCLE
There are more and more bicycles on the streets and pavements of Moscow. Cycling in the centre of Moscow is still a dangerous prospect, as the streets are overcrowded with fast-moving cars and the exhaust fumes are nasty.
That said, the city has launched a campaign to make the city safer for cyclists. As of 2016, there were some 250km of bike lanes, with plans for an additional 500km to be painted in coming years. There are a few parks and other off-road areas that are suitable for pleasure riding, including Gorky Park, Vorobyovy Gory Nature Preserve, Sokolniki and VDNKh.
If you're nervous about navigating the streets on your own (or if you just want some company), Moscow Bike Tours are a great way to see the city by bicycle.
BIKE SHARE

Moscow's new bike-share program is VeloBike (www.velobike.ru), an innovative system designed to cut down on traffic and encourage healthier living in the capital. It started in 2013 and now offers some 2700 bicycles at 350 stations around the city.
AGo online to purchase a membership (R150 for a day, R600 for a month, plus deposit). Now you are ready to roll!
AUse your credit card to unlock a bike at any station, go for a ride, and return your bike to any station. The first 30 minutes incurs no additional charge, but after that you'll pay for use.
AThe system is designed for transportation rather than recreation, so it's a good deal for short rides from point A to point B. For longer rides, you may be better off renting from Oliver Bikes.
BOAT
For new perspectives on Moscow’s neighbourhoods, fine views of the Kremlin, or just good, old-fashioned transport, a boat ride on the Moscow River is one of the city’s highlights. Capital Shipping Co (CCK, Столичная Судоходная Компания %495-225 6070; www.cck-ship.ru; adult/child 1hr cruise R900/700, 2-day pass R2400/2000) offers a two-day pass, so you can get on and off wherever you wish.
BUS, TROLLEYBUS & TRAM
Buses, trolleybuses and trams might be necessary for reaching some sights away from the city centre. Marshrutki (private buses and minibuses) are particularly useful to reach some destinations on the outskirts of Moscow. Buses can also be useful for a few cross-town or radial routes that the metro misses. In particular, there are several buses that run around the Kremlin Ring (Mokhovaya ul, ul Okhotny Ryad, Teatralyny pr, Staray pl), which is useful for the city centre.
If you don't have a ticket, you can buy one or several single-trip Ediny tickets from the driver for R55 per ticket.
METRO
The Moscow Metro (www.mosmetro.ru; per ride R55) is by far the easiest, quickest and cheapest way of getting around Moscow. Plus, many of the elegant stations are marble-faced, frescoed, gilded works of art. The 150-plus stations are marked outside by large ‘M’ signs.
Reliability The trains are generally reliable: you will rarely wait on a platform for more than three minutes. Nonetheless, they do get packed, especially during the city’s rush hours.
Tickets Ediny and Troika cards are sold at ticket booths. Queues can be long, so it’s useful (and slightly cheaper) to buy a multiple-ride ticket.
Maps & Signage Stations have maps of the system at the entrance and signs on each platform showing the destinations. The maps are generally in Cyrillic and Latin script, although the signs are usually only in Cyrillic. The carriages also have maps inside that show the stops for that line in both Roman and Cyrillic letters.
Transfers Interchange stations are linked by underground passages, indicated by perekhod signs, usually blue with a stick figure running up the stairs. Be aware that when two or more lines meet, the intersecting stations often (but not always) have different names.
Moscow Central Ring Operated by Russian Railways, the new ring line complements the existing metro system and is good for moving between such far-flung attractions as Izmaylovsky Market, the Botanical Gardens ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.gbsad.ru; mBotanichesky Sad) and Moscow International Business Centre.
TAXI
Taxi cabs are affordable. Unfortunately, you can't really flag down an official metered taxi in the street and most taxi drivers and dispatchers do not speak English.
These days, most people use mobile phone apps, such as Yandex.Taxi (Яндекс.Такси https://taxi.yandex.com), to order a cab. This solves the language barrier issue to an extent, given that you know the precise departure and destination address. If you have the app, try to make sure it's easy to park where you are, otherwise the driver will start calling you and asking questions in Russian.
You can also order an official taxi by phone or book it online, or get a Russian-speaker to do this for you. Normally, the dispatcher will ring you back within a few minutes to provide a description and licence number of the car. Most companies will send a car within 30 minutes of your call. Some reliable companies offer online scheduling.
Detskoe Taxi (Детское Такси %495-765 1180; www.detskoetaxi.ru) ‘Children’s Taxi’ has smoke-free cars and car seats for your children.
Lingo Taxi (www.lingotaxi.com) Promises English-speaking drivers (and usually delivers).
New Yellow Taxi (Новое жёлтое такси %495-940 8888; www.nyt.ru)
Taxi Blues (%495-925 5115; www.taxi-blues.ru)
Unofficial Taxis
This is now less common, but in the past almost any car in Moscow could be a taxi if the price was right. In the centre, you can often still stick your arm out and someone will stop pretty soon.
AMany private cars cruise around as unofficial taxis, and other drivers will often take you if they’re going in roughly the same direction.
AExpect to pay R300 to R500 for a ride around the city centre.
ADon’t hesitate to wave on a car if you don’t like the look of its occupants. As a general rule, it’s best to avoid riding in cars that already have a passenger. Be particularly careful taking a taxi that is waiting outside a nightclub or bar.
AROUND MOSCOW
As you leave Moscow, the fast-paced modern capital fades from view and the slower-paced, old-fashioned countryside unfolds around you. The subtly changing landscape of the Moscow region (Подмосковье) is crossed by winding rivers and dotted with peasant villages – the classic provincial Russia immortalised by artists and writers over the centuries.

Country Estates
Abramtsevo Абрамцево
Railway tycoon and art patron Savva Mamontov bought this lovely estate 45km north of Moscow in 1870. Here, he hosted a whole slew of painters and musicians, including Ilya Repin, landscape artist Isaak Levitan, portraitist Valentin Serov and ceramicist Mikhail Vrubel, as well as opera singer Fyodor Chaliapin. Today the Abramtsevo Estate Museum-Preserve (Музей-заповедник Абрамцево GOOGLE MAP ; %496-543 2470; www.abramtsevo.net; Museynaya ul 1, Abramtsevo; grounds R60, buildings & grounds R400; h10am-6pm Wed-Sun Apr-Sep, 10am-4pm Wed-Sun Oct-Mar) is a delightful retreat from Moscow or addition to a trip to nearby Sergiev Posad.
You can enter most of the buildings, some of which contain exhibits, if you buy the general admission ticket. The exception is the Manor House (Усадебный дом GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R300/150), which requires a separate admission ticket. The prettiest building is the Saviour Church ‘Not Made by Hand' (Храм Спаса Нерукотворного GOOGLE MAP ).
The best place to eat is Cafe Abramtsevo (Кафе Абрамцево GOOGLE MAP ; %8-915-177 3649; www.cafe-abramtsevo.ru; mains R340-640; h10am-6pm) across the street and down the lane from the main entrance to the estate.
Suburban trains run every half-hour from Moscow's Yaroslavsky station (R250, 1¼ hours). Most – but not all – trains to Sergiev Posad or Alexandrov stop at Abramtsevo. There are also regular buses between Abramtsevo and Sergiev Posad (R50, 20 minutes).
From the train platform, follow the foot trail through the woods, straight across the fire road, through a residential community and down a rough set of stairs. Before reaching the highway, turn left to cross the bridge and continue up into the parking area. The 1km walk is not well signposted.
Akhangelskoe Архангельское
In 1810, the wealthy Prince Nikolai Yusupov purchased this grand palace on the outskirts of Moscow, and turned it into the spectacular Arkhangelskoe Estate (Музей-усадьба Архангельское GOOGLE MAP ; %495-561 9759; www.arkhangelskoe.ru; grounds R150, grounds & museum R400; hgrounds 10am-8pm Wed-Sun, exhibits 10.30am-4.30pm Wed-Fri, 10am-6pm Sat & Sun). Now his palace displays the paintings, furniture, sculptures, glass, tapestries and porcelain that Yusupov accumulated over the years. In June, the estate is the exquisite setting for the popular Usadba Jazz Festival ( GOOGLE MAP ; %499-248 3605; www.usadba-jazz.ru; tickets from R4000).
From Tushinskaya metro, take bus 541 or 549 or marshrutka (fixed-route minibus) 151 to Arkhangelskoe (R50, 30 minutes).
Peredelkino Переделкино
Boris Pasternak – poet, author of Doctor Zhivago and winner of the 1958 Nobel Prize for Literature – lived for a long time on Moscow’s southwestern outskirts, just 5km beyond the city’s outer ring road, where there is now the Pasternak House-Museum (Дом-Музей Бориса Пастернака GOOGLE MAP ; %495-934 5175; www.pasternakmuseum.ru; ul Pavlenko 3, Peredelkino; adult/child R150/100; h11am-6pm Tue-Sun). Run by his descendents, it's an authentic glimpse into the life of the writer.
Frequent suburban trains go from Moscow’s Kiev Station to Peredelkino (R60, 25 minutes) on the line to Kaluga-II station. From Peredelkino station, follow the path west along the train tracks past the cemetery (where Pasternak is buried) and over the bridge. After about 400m, ul Pavlenko is on the right-hand side.
Gorki Leninskie Горки Ленинские
In Lenin’s later years, he and his family spent time at the Morozov manor house, set on lovely wooded grounds, 32km southeast of the capital. The estate now houses a Lenin museum (Музей-заповедник «Горки Ленинские» GOOGLE MAP ; %495-548 9309; www.mgorki.ru; all exhibits R600; h10am-7pm Wed-Sun May-Sep, 10am-4pm Wed-Sun Oct-Apr) and a re-creation of Lenin’s Kremlin office and apartment, as well as his vintage Rolls-Royce.
Bus 439 (R62, 30 minutes) leaves every 90 minutes for the estate from the Domodedovskaya metro station in Moscow. From the bus stop, you have to walk about 1km through a residential neighbourhood to the museum grounds. By car, follow the M4 highway (Kashirskoe sh) to 11km beyond the MKAD ring road, then turn left to Gorki Leninskie. There is a cafe on the grounds.
Klin Клин
From 1885, composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky spent his summers in Klin, 75km northwest of Moscow. In a charming house on the edge of town, he wrote the Nutcracker and Sleeping Beauty, as well as his famous Pathétique Symphony No 6. After he died in 1893, the estate was converted into a museum (Дом-Музей Чайковского GOOGLE MAP ; %496-245 8196, 496-245 1050; www.tchaikovsky-house-museum.ru; ul Chaykovskogo 48, Klin; R500, audio guide R150, photography R200; h10am-5pm Fri-Tue). The house is maintained just as it was when Tchaikovsky lived here. You can peruse photographs and personal effects, but only special guests are allowed to play his grand piano. Occasional concerts are held in the concert hall here.
Suburban trains from Moscow’s Leningrad Station run to Klin (R180, one to 1½ hours) throughout the day. Most of these continue to Tver (R150, 45 minutes to one hour). From the station, take marshrutka 5 to Tchaikovsky’s estate.
Melikhovo Мелихово
‘My estate’s not much,’ wrote playwright Anton Chekhov of his home at Melikhovo, south of Moscow, ‘but the surroundings are magnificent’. Chekhov lived here from 1892 until 1899 and wrote some of his most celebrated plays, including The Seagull and Uncle Vanya. Today, the estate houses the museum (Музей-заповедник А.П. Чехова «Мелихово» GOOGLE MAP ; %8-916-484 7247; www.chekhovmuseum.com; adult/child R200/165; h10am-5pm Tue-Sun) dedicated to the playwright and his work. Theatre buffs should visit in May, when the museum hosts Melikhovo Spring, a week-long theatre festival.
Suburban trains (R180, 1½ hours) run frequently from Moscow’s Kursk Station to Chekhov, 12km west of Melikhovo. Bus 25 makes the 20-minute journey between Chekhov and Melikhovo, with departures just about every hour.
Istra Истра
%498 / POPULATION 35,100
In the 17th century, Nikon – the patriarch whose reforms drove the Old Believers from the Orthodox Church – decided to show one and all that Russia deserved to be the centre of the Christian world. He did this by building a little Holy City right at home, complete with its own Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
1Sights
New Jerusalem MonasteryMONASTERY
(Новоиерусалимский монастырь GOOGLE MAP ; www.n-jerusalem.ru; Sovietskaya ul 2; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun Jun-Aug, to 5pm Sep-May)F
This grandiose complex was founded in 1656 near the picturesque Istra River (renamed the ‘Jordan’ by Patriarch Nikon). Unlike other Moscow monasteries, this one had no military use. The centrepiece is the Cathedral of the Resurrection (Воскресенский собор), modelled after Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre. After years as a museum, the monastery is now in Orthodox hands and is looking quite spectacular after a recent renovation.
New Jerusalem MuseumMUSEUM
(Музей Новый Иерусалим GOOGLE MAP ; www.museum-newjerusalem.ru; Novo-Ierusalimsckaya nab 1; exhibits each R200-500, all R650; h10am-6pm Tue-Fri, to 8pm Sat, to 7pm Sun)
The huge 'new' New Jersalem Museum is a modern, state-of-the-art museum, located across the river from the eponymous monastery. Exhibits draw on the hundreds of thousands of items in the monastery collections, including weapons, icons and artwork from the 17th century to modern times. Highlights include personal items belonging to Patriarch Nikon, as well as 20th-century drawings and handicrafts from around the Moscow region.
8Getting There & Away
Suburban trains run from Moscow’s Rizhsky vokzal to Istra (R145, 1½ hours, hourly), from where buses run to the Muzey stop by the New Jerusalem Monastery. The 20-minute walk from Istra train station is a pleasant alternative.
Borodino Бородино
In 1812 Napoleon invaded Russia, lured by the prospect of taking Moscow. For three months the Russians retreated, until on 26 August the two armies met in a bloody battle of attrition at the village of Borodino. In 15 hours, more than one third of each army was killed – over 100,000 soldiers in all. Europe would not again experience fighting as devastating as this until WWI. The French seemed to be the winners, as the Russians withdrew and abandoned Moscow. But Borodino was, in fact, the beginning of the end for Napoleon, who was soon in full, disastrous retreat.
Two hundred years later, the rural site presents a vivid history lesson. Start at the Borodino Museum (Музей-панорама 'Бородинская битва' GOOGLE MAP ; www.borodino.ru; adult/student R200/100; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun May-Oct, 9am-5pm Tue-Sun Nov-Apr), which provides a useful overview, then spend the rest of the day exploring the 100-sq-km preserve. If you have your own car, you can see monuments marking the sites of the most ferocious fighting, as well as the headquarters of both the French and Russian armies. If you come by train, you’ll probably be limited to the monuments along the road between the train station and the museum (which is many).
The rolling hills around Borodino and Semyonovskoe are largely undeveloped, due to their historic status. Facilities are extremely limited; if you forgot to pack your picnic, there's a small cafe (Арт-Кафе Бородино GOOGLE MAP ; mains R400-600) on the museum grounds serving Russian standards.
1Sights
Borodino FieldHISTORIC SITE
(Бородинское поле GOOGLE MAP ; www.borodino.ru; museum & all exhibits R400)
The entire battlefield – more than 100 sq km – is now part of the Borodino Field Museum-Preserve, its vast fields dotted with dozens of memorials to specific divisions and generals. The hilltop monument in front of Borodino Museum is Bagration’s tomb (Могила Багратиона), the grave of Prince Bagration, a heroic Georgian infantry general who was mortally wounded in battle. The front line was roughly along the 4km road from Borodino train station to the museum: you’ll see many monuments close to the road.
Further south, a concentration of monuments around Semyonovskoe marks the battle’s most frenzied fighting. Here, Bagration’s heroic Second Army, opposing far more numerous French forces, was virtually obliterated. Apparently, Russian commander Mikhail Kutuzov deliberately sacrificed Bagration’s army to save his larger First Army, opposing lighter French forces in the northern part of the battlefield. Kutuzov’s headquarters are marked by an obelisk in the village of Gorky. Another obelisk near Shevardino to the southwest, paid for in 1912 with French donations, marks Napoleon’s camp.
The battle scene was recreated during WWII, when the Red Army confronted the Nazis on this very site. Memorials to this battle also dot the fields, and WWII trenches surround the monument to Bagration. Near the train station are two WWII mass graves.
8Getting There & Away
A suburban train leaves from Moscow's Belorussky station to Borodino (R255, 2½ hours) at 7.51am (with additional trains departing at 9.52am and 11.22am on weekends). There are return trains at 3.29pm and 8.22pm. It's a 4km walk from Borodino station through the battlefield to Borodino Museum.
Since the area is rural, visiting by car is more convenient and probably more rewarding. If driving from Moscow, stay on the M1 highway (Minskoe sh) until the Mozhaysk turn-off, 95km beyond the Moscow outer ring road. It’s 5km north to Mozhaysk, then 13km west to Borodino village.

History
It was Peter the Great’s desire to make Russia a major European power that led to the founding of St Petersburg. At the start of the Great Northern War (1700–21), he captured the Swedish outposts on the Neva, and in 1703 he began the construction of his city with the Peter & Paul Fortress.
After Peter trounced the Swedes at Poltava in 1709, the city he named Sankt Pieter Burch (in Dutch style, after his namesake) really began to grow. In 1712 Peter moved the capital from Moscow to this still embryonic site, drafting in armies of peasants and Swedish prisoners of war to work as forced labour. Many died of disease and exhaustion, and St Petersburg is still known as ‘a city built upon bones’ to many Russians. Architects and artisans came to St Petersburg from all over Europe though, and by Peter’s death in 1725 the city had a population of 40,000 and some 90% of Russia’s foreign trade passed through it.
Between 1741 and 1825, during the reigns of Empress Elizabeth, Catherine the Great and Alexander I, St Petersburg became a cosmopolitan city with an imperial court of famed splendour. These monarchs commissioned glittering palaces, government buildings and grand churches.
Revolution & War
The emancipation of the serfs in 1861 and industrialisation, which peaked in the 1890s, brought a flood of workers into the city, leading to squalor, disease and festering discontent. St Petersburg became a hotbed of strikes and political violence, and was the hub of the 1905 revolution, sparked by ‘Bloody Sunday’ on 9 January 1905, when a strikers’ march to petition the tsar in the Winter Palace was fired on by troops. In 1914, in a wave of patriotism at the start of WWI, the city’s name was changed to the Russian-style Petrograd.
In 1917 the workers’ protests turned into a general strike and troops mutinied, forcing the end of the monarchy in March and the establishment of a provisional government. Seven months later, Lenin’s Bolshevik Party staged an audacious coup and the Soviet government came into being. Fearing a German attack on Petrograd, the new government moved the capital back to Moscow in March 1918.
Renamed Leningrad after Lenin’s death in 1924, the city became a hub of Stalin’s 1930s industrialisation program. By 1939 its population had grown to 3.1 million and it accounted for 11% of Soviet industrial output. Stalin feared the city as a rival powerbase, however, and the 1934 assassination of the local communist chief Sergei Kirov at the Smolny Institute was the start of his 1930s Communist Party purge.
When Germany attacked the USSR in June 1941, its armies took only 2 1/2 months to reach Leningrad. It was the birthplace of Bolshevism, and Hitler swore to wipe the city from the face of the earth. His troops besieged the city in what would become the defining event of the 20th century for St Petersburg. Around a million people died from shelling, starvation and disease in what’s often called the ‘900 Days’ (actually 872). By comparison, the USA and UK suffered about 700,000 dead between them in total for the whole of WWII. Leningrad survived and, after the war, was proclaimed a ‘hero city’.
St Petersburg Again
During the 1960s and ’70s, Leningrad developed a reputation as a dissident’s city with an artistic underground spearheaded by the poet Joseph Brodsky and, later, rock groups such as Akvarium. In 1989 Anatoly Sobchak, a reform-minded candidate, was elected mayor. Two years later, as the USSR crumbled, the city’s citizens voted to bring back the name of St Petersburg (though the region around the city remains known as Leningradskaya Oblast).
In the anarchic post-Soviet years of the early 1990s, it often seemed like the local ‘Mafia’ were more in charge than the city’s elected officials, who proved to be equally corrupt. Romanov ghosts returned to the city on 17 July 1998, when the remains of Tsar Nicholas II and some of his family were buried in the crypt at the SS Peter & Paul Cathedral within the fortress of the same name.
Five years later enormous sums were budgeted to spruce up the city for its tercentenary celebrations. Local boy made good Vladimir Putin didn’t waste the opportunity to return to his birthplace and show it off to visiting heads of state and other dignitaries. The city still enjoys a prominent status in modern Russia today and is a favourite spot for summits and other governmental meetings.
NEIGHBOURHOODS AT A GLANCE

1Historic Heart

Radiating out from the golden spire of the Admiralty towards the Fontanka River, the Historic Heart has plenty of obvious attractions, such as the Hermitage, Russian Museum and the Church on the Spilled Blood, not to mention the city's most famous avenue: Nevsky Prospekt. There are also quirky gems like the Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines and a quartet of lovely parks. This is where you will be spending most of your time in St Petersburg, especially as the area is also blessed with excellent hotels, dining and drinking options.
2Smolny & Vosstaniya

This agglomeration of four districts (Smolny, Liteyny, Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya) is also part of the city centre. The Smolny peninsula is a well-heeled residential district dominated by the Smolny Cathedral, while next-door Liteyny is centred on Liteyny pr, a commercial street between the Smolny and the Fontanka River. South of Nevsky pr are Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya. Vosstaniya is the focus of St Petersburg’s underground art and drinking scene, while Vladimirskaya, named after the stunning Vladimirsky Cathedral, is a mercantile district full of shopping, markets and a clutch of quirky museums.
3Sennaya & Kolomna

These two areas adjoin the Historic Heart and are almost as historic themselves. Sennaya is centred on Sennaya Pl (the Haymarket), a traditionally poor area that was immortalised in Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment and has somehow retained its seedy, down-at-heel air despite a big attempt to redevelop it. Kolomna is the largest of seven islands and a quiet, rather out-of-the-way place, although one steeped in history and great beauty. It contains the world-famous Mariinsky Theatre and more canals and rivers than any other part of the city.
4Vasilyevsky Island

The eastern edge of Vasilyevsky Island (or VO as it's usually shortened to) was originally designed to be the administrative heart of the city under Peter the Great. The plan was never carried out but there's still a concentration of historical sights there, including the Strelka and Kunstkamera. The western side of the island is more industrial, but is also home to the fantastic Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. Transport fans will be thrilled by the opportunity to tour a couple of submarines and an icebreaker, and by museums devoted to trams and the metro.
5Petrograd & Vyborg Sides

The Petrograd Side is a fascinating place that includes everything from the Peter and Paul Fortress to an impressive clutch of Style Moderne buildings lining its main drag. It also hosts a beautiful mosque, many interesting museums and huge swaths of parkland on the Kirov Islands, the city’s largest green lung. The Vyborg Side is famous for its role in Soviet history and can be a little bleak. That said, a walk around the fascinating postindustrial landscape here will appeal to travellers who have palace fatigue, and a few interesting sights make the trip worthwhile.
TOP SIGHT
THE HERMITAGE
The Hermitage fully lives up to its sterling reputation. You can be absorbed by its treasures for days and still come out wanting more. The enormous collection (over three million items, only a fraction of which are on display in 360 rooms) almost amounts to a comprehensive history of Western European art.

History
Catherine the Great, one of the greatest art collectors of all time, began the collection. Nicholas I also greatly enriched it and opened the galleries to the public for the first time in 1852.
It was the post-revolutionary period that saw the collection increase threefold, as many valuable private collections were seized by the state, including those of the Stroganovs, Sheremetyevs and Yusupovs. In 1948 it incorporated the renowned collections of post-Impressionist and Impressionist paintings of Moscow industrialists Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov.
Visiting the Hermitage
The State Hermitage consists of five linked buildings along riverside Dvortsovaya nab (rom west to east):
Winter Palace (Зимний дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Dvortsovaya pl 2; combined ticket R700; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mAdmiralteyskaya) This stunning mint-green, white and gold profusion of columns, windows and recesses, with its roof topped by rows of classical statues, was commissioned from Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1754 by Empress Elizabeth. Catherine the Great and her successors had most of the interior remodelled in a classical style by 1837. It remained an imperial home until 1917, though the last two tsars spent more time in other palaces.
Small Hermitage (Малый Эрмитаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Dvortsovaya pl 2; joint ticket R700; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mAdmiralteyskaya) Used by Catherine the Great as a retreat and to house the art collection started by Peter the Great, which she significantly expanded.
Great (Old) Hermitage (Большой (Старый) Эрмитаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Dvortsovaya pl 2; joint ticket R700; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mAdmiralteyskaya) This section of the museum (also known as the Large Hermitage) dates from the time of Catherine the Great. It mainly houses Italian Rennaissance art including works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Giorgione, Titian, Botticelli, Caravaggio and Tiepolo.
New Hermitage (Новый Эрмитаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Dvortsovaya pl 2; joint ticket R700; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mAdmiralteyskaya) Built for Nicholas II in 1852, to hold the growing art collection and as a museum for the public. Designed by German neoclassicist architect and painter von Klenze, the historically preserved rooms house the museum's collections of ancient art, European paintings, sculptures and decorative art.
Hermitage Theatre ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-408 1084; https://hermitagetheater.com; Dvortsovaya nab 32; online tickets from R8300; mAdmiralteyskaya) Designed by Giacomo Quarenghi, this intimate neo-classical auditorium was once the private theatre of the imperial family, and stands on the site of the original Winter Palace of Peter I.
The main public entrance is via the courtyard of the Winter Palace off Palace Sq.
Quick Tour
It would take days to fully do justice to the Hermitage’s huge collection. If your time is limited, zone in on the following rooms:
Room 100 Ancient Egypt
Jordan Staircase Directly ahead when you pass through the main entrance inside the Winter Palace.
Rooms 175–98 Imperial state rooms and apartments, including the Malachite Hall, Nicholas Hall, Armorial Hall and Hall of St George.
Room 204 The Pavilion Hall.
Rooms 207–238 Italian art, 13th to 18th centuries.
Rooms 239–40 Spanish art, 16th to 18th centuries.
Rooms 245–47 Flemish art, 17th century.
Rooms 249–254 Dutch art, 17th century.
Room 271 Grand Church, the imperial family’s cathedral.
Room 298–301 English art.
The Hermitage is a dynamic institution. Displays change, renovations continue, specific pieces go on tour, and temporary exhibitions occupy particular rooms, displacing whatever normally resides there, so be prepared for slight changes.
TOP TIPS

Organised Tours
Contact the excursions office to arrange a guided tour. These are one way to avoid queuing and, although they whiz round the main sections in about 1½ hours, at least they provide an introduction to the place in English, German or French. It’s easy to ‘lose’ the group and stay on until closing time.
Also contact the excursions office if you plan to visit the Hermitage's Treasure Gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-571 8446; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Winter Palace, Dvortsovaya pl; tour of Diamond or Golden Rooms R350; mAdmiralteyskaya). These two special collections, guarded behind vault doors, are open only by guided tour, for which you should either call ahead to reserve a place, or buy a ticket at the entrance. The Golden Rooms collection focuses on a hoard of fabulous Scythian and Greek gold and silver from the Caucasus, Crimea and Ukraine, dating from the 7th to 2nd centuries BC; the Diamond Rooms section has fabulous jewellery from Western Europe, and pieces from as far apart as China, India and Iran.
Other Branches
As much as you see in the museum, there’s about 20 times more in its vaults, part of which you can visit at the Hermitage Storage Facility. Other museum branches are the General Staff Building (home to the Hermitage's amazing collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist works), the Winter Palace of Peter I, the Menshikov Palace on Vasilyevsky Island, and the Imperial Porcelain factory.

PETER & PAUL FORTRESS
Housing a cathedral, a former prison and various exhibitions, this large defensive fortress on Zayachy Island is the kernel from which St Petersburg grew into the city it is today and a must-see for history buffs. There are also panoramic views from atop the fortress walls, at the foot of which lies a sandy riverside beach, a prime spot for sunbathing.

Entry & Tickets
The fortress was founded in 1703 and has never been utilised in the city’s defence – unless you count incarceration of political ‘criminals’ as national defence.
The main entrance is across the Ioannovsky Bridge at the island's northeast end; there's also access via the Kronwerk Bridge, which is within walking distance of Sportivnaya metro station.
Individual tickets are needed for each of the fortress’s attractions – though a combined entrance ticket gives access to Peter and Paul Cathedral, the Trubetskoy Bastion and three other sites.
Sights
All of Russia's prerevolutionary rulers from Peter the Great onwards (except Peter II and Ivan VI) are buried inside the SS Peter & Paul Cathedral ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R450/250; h10am-7pm Mon, Tue & Thu-Sat, 11am-7pm Sun; mGorkovskaya), which has a magnificent baroque interior. To ascend its 122.5m-high bell tower you'll have to join a guided tour (in Russian only), which happen several times a day.
Among the other sights don't miss the Commandant's House ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R200/120; h11am-6pm Mon & Thu-Sun, to 5pm Tue; mGorkovksaya), which charts the history of the St Petersburg region from medieval times to 1918; Trubetskoy Bastion ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R200/120; h10am-7pm Thu-Mon, to 6pm Tue; mGorkovskaya), where evocative use is made of the original cells for displays about the former political prisoners, who included the likes of Maxim Gorky, Leon Trotsky and Fyodor Dostoevsky.
A separate ticket gains you access to both the Postern, a 97.4m passage hidden in the fortress walls, and the Neva Panorama ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R300/270; h10am-8pm Thu-Tue; mGorkovskaya), a walkway atop the walls, which concludes at Naryshkin Bastion. Every day at noon a cannon is fired from here, a tradition dating back to Peter the Great's times.

RUSSIAN MUSEUM
Focusing solely on Russian art, from ancient church icons to 20th-century paintings, the Russian Museum's collection is magnificent and can easily be viewed in half a day or less. The collection is less overwhelming than that of the Hermitage, but the masterpieces nonetheless keep on coming as you tour the Mikhailovsky Palace and the attached Benois Wing.

Museum Tour
Enter the Mikhailovsky Palace's lower floor to the right of the main facade. Pick up a museum map before ascending the magnificent main staircase to the 1st floor, as this is where the chronological ordering of the exhibits from the 10th to the 20th century begins.
Galleries close for restoration and rehangings from time to time, and works are sometimes loaned out, so be prepared for slight changes to the following.
Mikhailovsky Palace, 2nd floor
Rooms 1–4 Russian icon painting, including work from the three major schools of Russian icon painting: Novgorod, Muscovy and Pskov.
Room 7 Houses a sculpture of Empress Anna with an Arab Boy.
Room 11 The White Hall, the most ornate in the palace, with period furniture by Rossi, is where Strauss and Berlioz performed concerts.
Room 14 Karl Bryullov’s massive Last Day of Pompeii (1827–33), which was, in its time, the most famous Russian painting ever; there were queues for months to see it. Ivan Aivazovsky’s seascapes also stand out, most frighteningly The Wave.
Room 15 Features a huge number of studies for Alexander Ivanov’s most famous work, The Appearance of Christ to the People, which hangs in Moscow’s Tretyakov Gallery.
Mikhailovsky Palace, 1st floor
Rooms 23–26 The Wanderers (Peredvizhniki) and associated artists, including KA Savitsky’s To War (Room 31); and Konstantin Makovsky (Room 25). Ghe’s masterpiece, Peter I Interrogating Tsarevich Alexey in Peterhof, is usually found in Room 26 along with other dark Ghe’s works such as The Last Supper.
Room 28 Pause to take in the talent of Ukrainian artist Marie Bashkirtseff, who died young, but not before painting striking portraits, such as Umbrella and the Three Smiles series.
Rooms 33–34 Works by Ilya Repin (1844–1930), probably Russia’s best-loved artist. His masterpiece, Barge Haulers on the Volga, an unrivalled portrait of human misery and enslavement in rural Russia, shows why the early Soviet authorities held him in high regard as a model for the Socialist Realist painters to come. Also check out his Zaporozhye Cossacks Writing a Mocking Letter to theTurkish Sultan.
Rooms 48 Mark Antokolsky’s statues Ivan the Terrible and Death of Socrates flank a souvenir stand. From here you enter the Benois Wing to your right or continue straight ahead for the lovely Russian folk art galleries featuring everything from kitchen equipment to giant carved house gables.
Room 54 Repin’s enormous rendition of the Ceremonial Sitting of the State Council on 7 May 1901, Marking the Centenary of Its Foundation. Around the walls are individual portraits of its members.
Benois Wing 2nd & 1st floors
Room 66 Works by the father of modern Russian art, Mikhail Vrubel including Epic Hero (Bogatyr) and Flying Demon.
Rooms 67–71 Works by an array of important early-20th-century painters including Nikolai Sapunin, Mikhail Nesterov and Boris Kustodiev, whose Merchant’s Wife at Tea is perhaps the most well-known picture here.
Room 72 Nathan Altman’s famous cubist Portrait of Anna Akhmatova.
Room 75–76 Works by suprematist Kasimir Malevich.
Rooms 77–78 Constructivist works by Alexander Lebedev and Alexander Rodchenko.
Rooms 79 Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin’s Portrait of Akhmatova and Mother of God.
Rooms 80–81 Most paintings from the Stalin era may have been censored beyond meaning, but there are some interesting portraits of daily life here, such as Alexander Samokhvalov’s Militarised Komsomol (1932–3)
Rooms 82–86 Late Soviet art is represented here. Look for Alexei Sundukov's Queue, which captures the failed economy of the times, and Dmitry Zhilinsky's The Artist's Family, showing several generations of a family.
Rooms 87–94 Works in these galleries range from a beautifully glazed ceramic fireplace by Mikhail Vrubel and other art nouveau–inspired pieces, to Soviet-era textiles, porcelain and textiles printed with ingenious patterns made out of tiny tractors or planes.
To reach the 1st floor of the Benois Wing (following your tour of the museum's main collection), use the stairs down off Rooms 91 and 92.
Branches of the Museum
Permanent and temporary exhibitions by the Russian Museum are also held at the Marble Palace, the Mikhailovsky Castle (also known as the Engineer's Castle) and the Stroganov Palace. Combined tickets, available at each palace, cover entrance either to your choice of two the same day (adult/student R600/270) or to all four within a three-day period (R850/400).
Mikhailovsky Palace was designed by Carlo Rossi and built between 1819 and 1825. It was a gift for Grand Duke Mikhail (brother of Tsars Alexander I and Nicholas I) as compensation for missing out on the throne. Nicholas II opened it as a public gallery on 7 March 1898.
The Benois Wing houses pieces from the 20th century as well as temporary exhibitions. It was constructed between 1914 and 1919. It is accessible through an entrance on nab kanala Griboyedova and connected to the original palace.

ST ISAAC'S CATHEDRAL
The golden dome of St Isaac’s Cathedral dominates the St Petersburg skyline. Its obscenely lavish interior is open as a museum, although services are held in the cathedral throughout the year. Most people bypass the museum to climb the 262 steps to the kolonnada (colonnade) around the drum of the dome, providing superb city views.

Montferrand's Design
Named after St Isaac of Dalmatia, on whose feast day Peter the Great was born, this is one of the largest domed buildings in the world.
French architect Auguste Montferrand began designing the cathedral in 1818. Due partly to technical issues, it took so long to build (until 1858) that Nicholas I was able to insist on an even more grandiose structure than Montferrand had originally planned. More than 100kg of gold leaf was used to cover the 21.8m-high dome alone, while the huge granite pillars on the building’s facade each weigh over 120 tonnes. There’s a statue of Montferrand holding a model of the cathedral on the west facade, although Nicholas I denied the architect his dying wish, to be buried here, considering it too high an honour for a mere artisan.
The cathedral’s interior is lavishly decorated with 600 sq metres of mosaics, 16,000kg of malachite, 14 types of marble and an 816-sq-metre ceiling painting by Karl Bryullov. Look out for some interesting photographs of the cathedral throughout its history, too.
Concerts & the Collonade
Check the website for details of choral concerts that are occasionally held here. From May to October both the cathedral and colonnade are open until 10.30pm, and from 1 June to 20 August the colonnade stays open until 4.30am.

The east wing of this magnificent building, wrapping around the south of Dvortsovaya pl and designed by Carlo Rossi in the 1820s, marries restored interiors with contemporary architecture to create a series of galleries displaying the Hermitage's amazing collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist works. Contemporary art is here, too, often in temporary exhibitions by major artists.

This five-domed dazzler is St Petersburg’s most elaborate church with a classic Russian Orthodox exterior and an interior decorated with some 7000 sq metres of mosaics. Officially called the Church of the Resurrection of Christ, its far more striking colloquial name references the assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II here in 1881.

The magnificently restored Shuvalovsky Palace is home to the world's largest collection of pieces manufactured by the jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé (including nine imperial Easter eggs) and fellow master craftspeople of pre-revolutionary Russia.
Tickets for the guided tours (one hour) can be booked online up to a week in advance.

(Строгановский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.rusmuseum.ru; Nevsky pr 17; adult/student R300/150; h10am-6pm Wed & Fri-Mon, 1-9pm Thu; mNevsky Prospekt)
One of the city’s loveliest baroque exteriors, the salmon-pink Stroganov Palace was designed by court favourite Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1753 for one of the city’s leading aristocratic families. The building has been superbly restored by the Russian Museum, and you can visit the impressive state rooms upstairs, where the Grand Dining Room, the Mineralogical Study and the Rastrelli Hall, with its vast frieze ceiling, are the obvious highlights.

(Казанский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 4663; http://kazansky-spb.ru; Kazanskaya pl 2; h8.30am-7.30pm; mNevsky Prospekt)F
This neoclassical cathedral, partly modelled on St Peter’s in Rome, was commissioned by Tsar Paul shortly before he was murdered in a coup. Its 111m-long colonnaded arms reach out towards Nevsky pr, encircling a garden studded with statues. Inside, the cathedral is dark and traditionally Orthodox, with a daunting 80m-high dome. There is usually a queue of believers waiting to kiss the icon of Our Lady of Kazan, a copy of one of Russia’s most important icons.
Bronze HorsemanMONUMENT
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Senatskaya pl; mSadovaya)
The most famous statue of Peter the Great was immortalised as the Bronze Horseman in the epic poem by Alexander Pushkin. With his horse (representing Russia) rearing above the snake of treason, Peter’s enormous statue was sculpted over 12 years for Catherine the Great by Frenchman Etienne Falconet. Its inscription reads ‘To Peter I from Catherine II – 1782’.

The city's oldest park, these leafy, shady gardens can be entered either at the northern Neva or southern Moyka end. Early-18th-century architects designed the garden in a Dutch baroque style, following a geometric plan, with fountains, pavilions and sculptures studding the grounds. The ornate cast-iron fence along the Neva side was a later addition, built between 1771 and 1784.

This branch of the Russian Museum features temporary exhibitions of contemporary art and a permanent display of paintings from the Ludwig Museum in Cologne that includes works by Picasso, Warhol, Basquiat and Liechtenstein. The palace, designed by Antonio Rinaldi, gets its name from the 36 kinds of marble used in its construction. Highlights include the Gala Staircase, made of subtly changing grey Urals marble; and the impressive Marble Hall, with walls of lapis lazuli and marble in a range of colours from yellow to pink.

Administered by the Russian Museum, these 8.7-hectare gardens are lovely and offer an impressive perspective of Mikhailovsky Castle. They are famous for their Style Moderne wrought-iron fence and gates, a profusion of metallic blooms and flourishes that wrap around one side of the Church on the Spilled Blood.

Giving new meaning to 'back in the USSR', this 'museum' is sure to be one of the most entertaining ones you will visit in St Petersburg. Admission includes a stack of 15 kopek coins used to operate the 50-odd game machines in its collection, which date to the Brezhnev era.
Mars FieldPARK
(Марсово поле MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab Lebyazhey kanavki; mNevsky Prospekt)
Named after the Roman god of war and once the scene of 19th-century military parades, the grassy Mars Field is a popular spot for strollers, even though in the early 20th century it was used as a burial ground for victims and heroes of the revolution. At its centre, an eternal flame ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) has been burning since 1957 in memory of the victims of all wars and revolutions in St Petersburg.

This excellent museum displays the traditional crafts, customs and beliefs of more than 150 cultures that make up Russia’s fragile ethnic mosaic. It’s a marvellous collection with particularly strong sections on the Jews of Russia, Transcaucasia and Central Asia, including rugs and two full-size yurts (nomads’ portable tent-houses). Galleries are accessed either side of the magnificent 1000-sq-m Marble Hall, flanked by rows of pink Karelian-marble columns, in which events and concerts are held.
AdmiraltyARCHITECTURE

The gilded spire of the Admiralty is a prime St Petersburg landmark, visible from Gorokhovaya ul, Voznesensky pr and Nevsky pr, as all of these roads radiate outwards from this central point. From 1711 to 1917, this spot was the headquarters of the Russian navy; now it houses the country’s largest military naval college and is closed to the public.
ST PETERSBURG IN ...

Two Days
On day one wander down Nevsky pr, dropping into the Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood and Kazan Cathedral. Also take in the view from atop St Isaac’s Cathedral. After lunch visit the Yusupov Palace and New Holland. Spend the evening seeing a ballet or opera at the Mariinsky Theatre.
Devote day two to the wondrous Hermitage and its extraordinary collection, including the stellar impressionist collection in the General Staff Building on the other side of Palace Sq. When you leave, relax by taking a sightseeing cruise around the canals, followed by dinner at Cococo, enjoying contemporary takes on traditional Russian cuisine.
Four Days
On day three start at the Peter & Paul Fortress to see where the city began, and wander past the Mosque and take in the Style Modern architecture of Kamennoostrovsky pr. Wander across the bridge to Vasilevsky Island and see the Strelka, the fascinating Kunstkamera and then either the Menshikov Palace, for history fans, or the Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art, for art lovers.
Start day four travelling out to Pushkin (Tsarskoe Selo) for a visit to the extraordinary Catherine Palace, and then continue to nearby Pavlovsk for a walk in the gorgeous gardens. If you have time on returning to the city, make a tour of the superb Russian Museum. Top off the night with cocktails at one of St Petersburg's cosy bars such as Apotheke Bar.
THE BRIDGES OF ST PETERSBURG

Some 342 bridges span St Petersburg’s network of canals and waterways. It's quite a sight to witness the raising of the bridges over the Neva river during the navigation period. Dvortsovy most (Palace Bridge; Дворцовый мост MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mAdmiralteyskaya), beside the Winter Palace, is one of the most popular spots to watch this event as there is classical music broadcasting and a carnival atmosphere with street vendors and plenty of sightseeing boats bobbing in the Neva.
Some of the most charming bridges, though, are the smaller structures that span the canals around the city. Here are a few of our favourites:
Anichkov most (Аничков мост MAP GOOGLE MAP ) Features rearing horses at all four corners, symbolising humanity’s struggle with, and taming of, nature.
Bankovsky most (Банковский мост MAP GOOGLE MAP ) Suspended by cables emerging from the mouths of golden-winged griffins. The name comes from the Assignment Bank (now a university), which stands on one side of the bridge.
Most Lomonosova (Мост Ломоносова MAP GOOGLE MAP ) Four Doric towers contain the mechanism that pulls up the moveable central section, allowing tall boats to pass along the Fontanka underneath.
Lviny most (Bridge of Four Lions; MAP GOOGLE MAP ) This suspension bridge is supported by two pairs of regal lions.
Panteleymonovsky most (Пантелеймоновский мост MAP GOOGLE MAP ) At the confluence of the Moyka and the Fontanka, this beauty features lamp posts bedecked with the double-headed eagle and railings adorned with the coat of arms.

The Alexander Nevsky Monastery – named for the patron saint of St Petersburg – is the city's most ancient and eminent monastery. Peter the Great made a mistake when he founded the monastery on this spot at the far end of Nevsky pr, thinking wrongly that it was the site where Alexander of Novgorod had beaten the Swedes in 1240. Nonetheless, in 1797 the monastery became a lavra, the most senior grade of Russian Orthodox monasteries.
Today it is a working monastery that attracts the most devout believers – a revered and holy place – as well as the gravesite of some of Russia's most famous artistic figures. You can wander freely around most of the grounds, but you must buy tickets from the kiosk on your right after entering the main gates to enter the most important two graveyards.
Museum of the Defence & Blockade of LeningradMUSEUM

The grim but engrossing displays here contain donations from survivors, propaganda posters from the blockade period and many photos depicting life and death during the siege. You'll see the meagre bread rations as they dwindled by the month, drawings made by children trying to cope with the loss of family members, and snapshots taken during Shostakovich's Symphony No.7 – composed and played during the siege (by famished musicians), to show the world that Leningrad was not down for the count.
Anna Akhmatova Museum at the Fountain HouseMUSEUM
(Музей Анны Ахматовой в Фонтанном Доме MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.akhmatova.spb.ru; Liteyny pr 51; adult/child R120/free, audio guide R200; h10.30am-6.30pm Tue & Thu-Sun, noon-8pm Wed; mMayakovskaya)
Housed in the south wing of the Sheremetyev Palace, this touching and fascinating literary museum celebrates the life and work of Anna Akhmatova, St Petersburg’s most famous 20th-century poet. Akhmatova lived here from 1926 until 1952, invited by the art scholar Nikolai Punin, who lived in several rooms with his family. The two had a long-running affair, somewhat complicated by the tight living situation – Punin didn't want to separate from his wife.
Admission also includes the Josef Brodsky American Study. Brodsky did not live here, but his connection with Akhmatova was strong. For lack of a better location, his office has been re-created here, complete with furniture and other artifacts from his adopted home in Massachusetts. Funds are currently being collected to open a Josef Brodsky Museum at the poet's former home a few blocks away on Liteyny pr.
When coming to the museum, be sure to enter from Liteyny pr, rather than from the Fontanka River, where the main palace entrance is, as it's not possible to reach the museum from there.

Fyodor Dostoevsky lived in flats all over the city (mostly in Sennaya), but his final residence is this ‘memorial flat’ where he lived from 1878 until he died in 1881. The apartment remains as it was when the Dostoevsky family lived here, including the study where he wrote The Brothers Karamazov, and the office of Anna Grigorievna, his wife, who recopied, edited and sold all of his books.

In a once-industrial part of the city, Lumiere Hall hosts large-format multimedia exhibitions – basically massive 3D projections in a 360-degree space, with audio commentary on the works displayed and the artists behind the creations. Take a seat on beanbags and enjoy the show. Recent installations have included projections of paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky, Van Gogh and Gustav Klimt. It's a 1km walk from the metro station. Head up to the canal and turn right.
Tauride Palace & GardensPARK

Catherine the Great had this baroque palace built in 1783 for Grigory Potemkin, a famed general and her companion for many years. Today it is home to the Commonwealth of Independent States and is closed to the public. The gardens, on the other hand, are open to all; once the romping grounds of the tsarina, they became a park for the people under the Soviets, and their facilities include a lake, several cafes and an entertainment centre.

This now legendary locale is a former apartment block – affectionately called by its street address despite the fact that the public entrance is actually on Ligovsky pr – that contains studio and gallery space, as well as music clubs Fish Fabrique and Fabrique Nouvelle ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.fishfabrique.spb.ru; Ligovsky pr 53; h3pm-late; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), plus an assortment of other shops and galleries. It offers a unique opportunity to hang out with local musicians and artists, who are always eager to talk about their work.
One ticket gives admission to all the galleries.
Vladimirsky CathedralCATHEDRAL
(Владимирский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Vladimirsky pr 20; h8am-6pm, services 6pm daily; mVladimirskaya)
This fantastic, five-domed cathedral, ascribed to Domenico Trezzini, is the namesake of this neighbourhood. Incorporating both baroque and neoclassical elements, the cathedral was built in the 1760s, with Giacomo Quarenghi’s neoclassical belltower added later in the century. One famous member of the congregation was Dostoevsky, who lived around the corner. The cathedral was closed in 1932 and the Soviets turned it into an underwear factory, but in 1990 it was reconsecrated and resumed its originally intended function.
Museum of Decorative & Applied ArtsMUSEUM

Also known as the Stieglitz Museum, this fascinating establishment is as beautiful as you would expect a decorative arts museum to be. An array of gorgeous objects is on display, from medieval furniture to 18th-century Russian tiled stoves and contemporary works by the students of the Applied Arts School (also housed here). This museum is less visited than some of its counterparts in the city, but the quiet atmosphere only adds to its appeal.
Kuryokhin CentreARTS CENTRE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-322 4223; www.kuryokhin.net; 4th flr, Ligovsky pr 73; R100; h11am-9pm Mon-Sat; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
Named after Sergey Kuryokhin (1954–96), a legend of the Russian contemporary arts and music scene, this is the temporary home of the arts centre until its new home on Vasilevsky Island is ready (late 2019). You can view some of the talented avant-garde artist's work and that of his contemporaries including the band Kino and performance artist Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe. You can also see exhibitions of new works that push the artistic boundaries.
Smolny CathedralCHURCH
(Смольный собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-577 1421; pl Rastrelli 3/1; belltower adult/child R150/50; hchurch 7am-8pm, bell-tower 10am-6pm; mChernyshevskaya)
If baroque is your thing, then look no further than the sky-blue Smolny Cathedral, an unrivalled masterpiece of the genre that ranks among Bartolomeo Rastrelli’s most amazing creations. The cathedral is the centrepiece of a convent mostly built to Rastrelli’s designs between 1748 and 1757. His inspiration was to combine baroque details with the forest of towers and onion domes typical of an old Russian monastery. You'll get a fascinating perspective over the church and city beyond from the 63m-high belltower.

oYusupov PalacePALACE
(Юсуповский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-921-970 3038; www.yusupov-palace.ru; nab reki Moyki 94; adult/student incl audio guide R700/500, Rasputin tour R350/250; h11am-6pm; mSadovaya)
This spectacular palace on the Moyka River has some of the best 19th-century interiors in the city, in addition to a fascinating and gruesome history. The palace’s last owner was the eccentric Prince Felix Yusupov, a high-society darling and at one time the richest man in Russia. Most notoriously, the palace is the place where Grigory Rasputin was murdered in 1916, and the basement where this now infamous plot unravelled can be visited as part of a guided tour.
oNew HollandISLAND
(Новая Голландия MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.newhollandsp.ru; nab Admiralteyskogo kanala; h9am-10pm Mon-Thu, to 11pm Fri-Sun; mSadovaya)
This triangular island was closed for the most part of the last three centuries, and has opened to the public in dazzling fashion. There's plenty going on here, with hundreds of events happening throughout the year. There are summertime concerts, art exhibitions, yoga classes and film screenings, plus restaurants, cafes and shops. You can also come to enjoy a bit of quiet on the grass – or on one of the pontoons floating in the pond.
Central Naval MuseumMUSEUM
(Центральный военно-морской музей MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-303 8513; www.navalmuseum.ru; pl Truda; adult/student R600/400; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Following a move to this beautifully repurposed building opposite the former shipyard of New Holland, the Central Naval Museum has moved into the 21st century and is now one of St Petersburg's best history museums. The superb, light-bathed building houses an enormous collection of models, paintings and other artefacts from three centuries of Russian naval history, including botik, the small boat known as the 'grandfather of the Russian navy' – stumbling across it in the late 17th century was Peter the Great's inspiration to create a Russian maritime force.

House of MusicPALACE

This fabulous and fully restored mansion on the Moyka River belonged to Grand Duke Alexey, the son of Alexander II. The wrought-iron-and-stone fence is one of its most stunning features, with the Grand Duke’s monogram adorning the gates. Tours of the house usually take place once or twice a week, but the dates vary and tickets often sell out in advance, so check the website. Another way to visit the interior is to attend a concert here.
Grand Choral SynagogueSYNAGOGUE

Designed by Vasily Stasov, the striking Grand Choral Synagogue opened in 1893 to provide a central place of worship for St Petersburg’s growing Jewish community. Its lavishness (particularly notable in the 47m-high cupola and the decorative wedding chapel) indicates the pivotal role that Jews played in imperial St Petersburg. The synagogue was fully revamped in 2003. Visitors are welcome except on the Sabbath and other holy days. Men and married women should cover their heads upon entering.

Nikolsky CathedralCATHEDRAL
(Никольский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nikolskaya pl 1/3; h9am-7pm; mSadovaya)
Surrounded on two sides by canals, this ice-blue cathedral is one of the most picture-perfect in the city, beloved by locals for its baroque spires and golden domes. It was one of the few churches that still operated during the Soviet era, when organised religion was effectively banned.
Rumyantsev MansionMUSEUM
(Особняк Румянцева MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Angliyskaya nab 44; adult/student R200/100; h11am-6pm Thu-Mon, to 5pm Tue; mAdmiralteyskaya)
History buffs should not miss this oft-overlooked but superb local museum. Part of the State Museum of the History of St Petersburg, the mansion contains an exhibition of 20th-century history, including displays devoted to the 1921 New Economic Policy (NEP), the industrialisation and development of the 1930s, and the Siege of Leningrad during WWII. Exhibitions are unusual in that they depict everyday life in the city during these historic periods. Each room has an explanatory panel in English.
Sennaya PloshchadSQUARE
(Сенная площадь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Immortalised by Dostoevsky, who lived all over the neighbourhood and set Crime and Punishment here, St Petersburg’s Haymarket was once the city’s filthy underbelly. Indeed, until a much-needed facelift just over a decade ago, the square was overloaded with makeshift kiosks and market stalls, which made it a magnet for the homeless, beggars, pickpockets and drunks. These days, you'll have to look hard to find vestiges of its once insalubrious days.
Nabokov MuseumMUSEUM
(Музей Набокова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.nabokov.museums.spbu.ru/En; Bolshaya Morskaya ul 47; h11am-6pm Tue-Fri, to 5pm Sat; mAdmiralteyskaya)F
This 19th-century townhouse was the suitably grand childhood home of Vladimir Nabokov, infamous author of Lolita and arguably the most versatile of 20th century Russian writers. Here Nabokov lived with his wealthy family from his birth in 1899 until the revolution in 1917, when they left the country. Nabokov artefacts on display include family photographs, first editions of his books and parts of his extensive butterfly collection.
Railway MuseumMUSEUM

This museum near Sennaya pl is a must for train-set fans and modellers. It houses a collection of scale locomotives and model railway bridges, often made by the engineers who built the real ones. The oldest such collection in the world, the museum dates to 1809, 28 years before Russia had its first working train!
WORTH A TRIP
SOVIET SOUTH

Sprawling southern St Petersburg was once planned to be the centre of Stalin’s Leningrad, and it contains grand buildings, over-the-top monuments and sculpture-lined green spaces that celebrate now mostly forgotten figures of the past. You’ll also see largely middle-class Russians and families, who’ve given new life to these marble-lined boulevards.
Moscow Triumphal Arch
Bristling with spears, shields and banners, this imposing 12-columned gate was built to celebrate victory in the 1828 Russo-Turkish War and once marked the southern entrance to the imperial capital. In 1936 the gates were dismantled under Stalin’s order and were later used as anti-tank defences in WWII. They were restored in 1960.
Grand Market Rossiya
Russia in all its grit and glory – from the industrial sprawl of Magnitogorsk to the glittering domes of Moscow – is on full display at this vast re-creation ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-495 5465; www.grandmaket.ru; Tsvetochnaya ul 16; adult/child R480/280, audio guide or binoculars R250; h10am-8pm; mMoskovskoe Vorota) of the motherland in miniature. One huge room contains mountains, cities, rivers and lakes, with lots of mechanised action that you can observe while strolling around.
Park Pobedy
This large green space gathers a cross-section of Petersburgers, including young families, teens and canoodling couples who stroll the leafy paths and enjoy the views over the ponds and flower gardens. Built to celebrate Russia’s victory in WWII, the park ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Moskovsky pr; h6am-midnight; mPark Pobedy) is full of statues of Soviet war heroes, and has a beneficent depiction of Lenin interacting with small children.
Chesme Church
This striking red-and-white 18th-century Gothic church (Чесменская церковь GOOGLE MAP ; https://chesma.spb.ru; ul Lensoveta 12; h10am-7pm; mMoskovskaya) commemorates the 1770 Battle of Chesme. This is where Catherine the Great was standing when news arrived of the victory over the Turks. The capricious monarch ordered a shrine be built to preserve this historic moment. It now seems particularly incongruous with its Stalinist surroundings.
House of the Soviets
Begun by Noi Trotsky in 1936, the bombastic House of Soviets (Дом советов GOOGLE MAP ; Moskovsky pr 212; mMoskovskaya) was only finished after the war, by which time the architect had been purged. Nonetheless, this magnificently sinister building is a great example of Stalinist design, with its columns and bas-reliefs and an enormous frieze across the top.
Monument to the Heroic Defenders of Leningrad
Centred around a 48m-high obelisk, the monument (Монумент героическим защитникам Ленинграда GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; pl Pobedy; R200; h10am-6pm Thu-Mon, until 5pm Tue; mMoskovskaya), unveiled in 1975, symbolises the city’s encirclement and eventual victory in WWII. On a lower level, flickering torches ring a very moving sculpture depicting the city’s suffering. From there, you can enter an underground exhibition, which delves into the war and siege.
Vasilyevsky Island
oKunstkameraMUSEUM
(Кунсткамера MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-328 1412; www.kunstkamera.ru; Universitetskaya nab 3, entrance on Tamozhenny per; adult/child R300/100; h11am-7pm Tue-Sun; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Also known as the Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology, this is the city’s first museum, founded in 1714 by Peter himself. It is famous largely for its ghoulish collection of monstrosities, preserved ‘freaks’, two-headed mutant foetuses, deformed animals and odd body parts, all collected by Peter. While most rush to see these sad specimens, there are also interesting exhibitions on native peoples from around the world.
oErarta Museum of Contemporary ArtMUSEUM
(Музей современного искусства Эрарта MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-324 0809; www.erarta.com; 29-ya Liniya 2; adult/under 21yr R500/350; h10am-10pm Wed-Mon; mVasileostrovskaya)
Erarta's superb hoard of 2300 pieces of Russian contemporary art trumps its somewhat far-flung location. Housed in an ingeniously converted neoclassical Stalinist building, the museum is spread over five floors, with the main galleries focused on the permanent collection. There are also installation spaces, plenty of temporary exhibitions, occasional shows, plus a good restaurant and gift shop.
StrelkaLANDMARK
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Birzhevaya pl; mVasileostrovskaya)
This eastern tip of Vasilyevsky Island is where Peter the Great wanted his new city’s administrative and intellectual centre to be. In fact, it became the focus of the city's maritime trade, symbolised by the colonnaded Customs House (now the Institute of Russian Literature) and the Old Stock Exchange. The Strelka is flanked by the pair of Rostral Columns (Ростральная колонна MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Birzhevaya pl; mVasileostrovskaya), archetypal St Petersburg landmarks.
Museum of ZoologyMUSEUM
(Зоологический музей MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-328 0112; www.zin.ru; Universitetskaya nab 1; adult/student R250/150; h11am-6pm Wed-Mon; mAdmiralteyskaya)
One of the biggest and best of its kind in the world, the Museum of Zoology was founded in 1832 and has some amazing exhibits, including a vast blue whale skeleton that greets you in the first hall. The highlight is unquestionably the stuffed skin of a 44,000-year-old woolly mammoth thawed out of the Siberian ice in 1902. There are also skeletons of a further three mammoths, including two baby ones – all incredible finds.

Menshikov PalaceMUSEUM
(Государственный Эрмитаж-Дворец Меншикова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-323 1112; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Universitetskaya nab 15; admission R300; h10.30am-6pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, to 9pm Wed & Fri; mVasileostrovskaya)
The first stone building in the city, the Menshikov Palace was built to the grandiose tastes of Prince Alexander Menshikov, Peter the Great’s closest friend and the first governor of St Petersburg. It is now a branch of the Hermitage, and while only a relatively small part of the palace is open to visitors, its interiors are some of the oldest and best preserved in the city.
Twelve CollegesUNIVERSITY
(Двенадцать коллегий MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Mendeleevskaya liniya; mVasileostrovskaya)
Completed in 1744 and marked by a statue of scientist-poet Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–65), the 400m-long Twelve Colleges is one of St Petersburg’s oldest buildings. It was originally meant for Peter’s government ministries, but is now part of the university, which stretches out behind it. Within these walls populist philosopher Nikolai Chernyshevsky studied, Alexander Popov created some of the world’s first radio waves and a young Vladimir Putin earned a degree in law.
This is also where Dmitry Mendeleev invented the periodic table of elements, and the building now contains the small Mendeleev Museum (Музей-Архив Санкт-Петербургского Университета Д.И.Менделеева MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-328 9744; Universitetskaya nab 7-9; h11am-4pm Mon-Fri; mVasileostrovskaya). Also of interest here is the University Sculpture Garden ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Universitetskaya nab 11; h8am-5pm; mAdmiralteyskaya), which can be accessed from the main entrance.
Temple of the AssumptionCHURCH
(Храм Успения Пресвятой Богородицы MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-321 7473; http://spb.optina.ru; nab Leytenanta Shmidta 27/2; h8am-8pm; mVasileostrovskaya)F
This stunning 1895 neo-Byzantine church was built by architect Vasily Kosyakov on the site of a former monastery. It was closed during the Soviet period, and in 1957 the building became the city’s first – and very popular – year-round skating rink. The 7.7m, 861kg metal cross on the roof was only replaced in 1998. Following a wonderful renovation, the church is looking superb again; do go inside to see the murals and icons covering the interior.
Russian Academy of Fine Arts MuseumMUSEUM
(Музей Академии Художеств MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-323 6496; www.nimrah.ru; Universitetskaya nab 17; R500, photos R500; hnoon-8pm Wed, 11am-7pm Thu, Sat & Sun, 1-9pm Fri; mVasileostrovskaya)
Art lovers should not bypass the museum of this time-tested institution, which contains work by academy students and faculty dating back to its foundation in 1857. Two 3500-year-old sphinxes guard the entrance of this original location of the academy, where boys would live from the age of five until they graduated at age 15. It was an experiment to create a new species of human: the artist.
CREATIVE CLUSTERS

Occupying either old buildings or former industrial complexes across the city are a series of 'creative clusters' that are home to a vibrant mix of artists, creative businesses, boutiques, bars and restaurants. The following are the best ones:
Loft Project ETAGI (Лофт проект ЭТАЖИ MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-458 5005; www.loftprojectetagi.ru; Ligovsky pr 74; rooftop R100; h9am-11pm; mLigovsky Prospekt) This five-floor former bakery, which includes exhibition spaces, eye-catching shops, a hostel, a bar and a cafe, kicked off the creative cluster trend in 2007. In the yard, converted shipping containers house yet more pop-up clothing shops, record sellers, cafes and eateries whipping up affordable street food.
Taiga The warren of rooms in the ancient building near the Hermitage are worth exploring to find cool businesses ranging from a barber to fashion and books. 8 Store ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-981-741 1880; http://8-store.ru; Dvortsovaya nab 20; h1-9pm; mAdmiralteyskaya), a stylish boutique stacked with clothes and accessories by local designers, is one of the best. Also great for original design gifts and souvenirs is Imenno Lavka (Именно-лавка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-921-581 0466; www.imenno-lavka.ru; TAIGA, Dvortsovaya nab 20; h11am-7pm; mAdmiralteyskaya).
Golitsyn Loft ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reky Fontanki 20; mGostiny Dvor) This new epicentre of creativity on the Fontanka River offers the usual mix of businesses as well as a hostel with capsule-style bunks. Enter via the archway into a large courtyard, which is spread with outdoor eating and drinking spots in the summer, then head up any of the stairwells into the five buildings for a bit of urban exploration. On weekends the centre stages events, such as craft markets, concerts and film screenings.
Berthold Center (Бертгольд Центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.vk.com/bertholdcentre; Grazhdanskaya ul 13; mSadovaya) A handful of shops, cafes and galleries spread around a former foundry. There's a courtyard in the centre of the complex that gathers a young, bohemian crowd – especially during special events and concerts (bands sometimes play on a rooftop just overlooking the courtyard).
Artmuza (Артмуза MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-313 4703; http://artmuza.spb.ru; 13-ya liniya 70-72; h11am-10pm; mSportivnaya) With around 13,000 sq metres of space over several floors, this is one of St Petersburg's largest creative clusters. On the ground floor look out for the joint atelier of Snega Gallery and Slavutnitsa where designers specialise in making clothes and accessories based on traditional Russian costumes and patterns. Also come here to see exhibitions and theatre, and to the enjoy the view from its large rooftop terrace (where there's also a cafe).
Tkachi (Ткачи MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tkachi.com; nab Obvodnogo kanala 60; h10am-10pm; mObvodny Kanal) In an otherwise derelict part of town, 'Weavers' is an impressive conversion of a warehouse into a 'creative space'. On the ground floor you'll find gifts, clothes, bikes and electronics, while the 5th floor is a huge exhibition space and restaurant.
Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
oHermitage Storage FacilityMUSEUM
(Реставрационно-хранительский центр Старая деревня MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-340 1026; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Zausadebnaya ul 37a; tours R550; htours 11am, 1pm, 1.30pm & 3.30pm Wed-Sun; c; mStaraya Derevnya)
Guided tours of the Hermitage’s state-of-the-art restoration and storage facility are highly recommended. This is not a formal exhibition as such, but the guides are knowledgeable and the examples chosen for display (paintings, furniture and carriages) are wonderful.
The storage facility is directly behind the big shopping centre opposite the metro station – look for the enormous golden-yellow glass facility decorated with shapes inspired by petroglyphs.
Museum of Political HistoryMUSEUM
(Музей политической истории России MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-313 6163; www.polithistory.ru; ul Kuybysheva 4; adult/child R200/free, audio guide R200; h10am-6pm Sat-Tue, 10am-8pm Wed & Fri, closed Thu; mGorkovskaya)
The elegant Style Moderne Kshesinskaya Palace (1904) is a highly appropriate location for this excellent museum – one of the city's best – covering Russian politics in scrupulous detail up to contemporary times.
The palace, previously the home of Mathilda Kshesinskaya, famous ballet dancer and one-time lover of Nicholas II in his pre-tsar days, was briefly the headquarters of the Bolsheviks, and Lenin often gave speeches from the balcony.

Kirov MuseumMUSEUM
(Музей Кирова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kirovmuseum.ru; Kamennoostrovsky pr 26/28; adult/child R150/100; h11am-6pm Thu-Tue; mPetrogradskaya)
Leningrad party boss Sergei Kirov was one of the most powerful men in Russia in the early 1930s. His decidedly un-proletarian apartment is now a fascinating museum showing how the Bolshevik elite really lived: take a quick journey back to the days of Soviet glory, including choice examples of 1920s technology, such as the first-ever Soviet-produced typewriter and a conspicuously noncommunist GE fridge, complete with plastic food inside.
Botanical GardensGARDENS
(Ботанический сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-372 5464; http://botsad-spb.com; ul Professora Popova 2; adult/child R300/200; hgrounds 10am-8pm Tue-Sun May-Sep; greenhouse 11am-4.30pm Tue-Sun year-round; mPetrogradskaya)
On eastern Aptekarsky (Apothecary) Island, this was once a garden of medicinal plants – founded by Peter the Great himself in 1714 – that gave the island its name. Today the botanical gardens contain 26 greenhouses on a 22-hectare site. It is a lovely place to stroll around, and a fascinating place to visit – and not just for botanists.
Buddhist TempleTEMPLE
(Буддистский Храм MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %981-755 9605; www.dazan.spb.ru; Primorsky pr 91; h10am-6pm Mon-Fri, to 7pm Sat & Sun; mStaraya Derevnya)
Another in the city's collection of grand religious buildings is this beautiful functioning datsan (temple) where respectful visitors are welcome. The main prayer hall has lovely mosaic decoration and there's a cheap and cheerful cafe in the basement. The temple was built between 1909 and 1915 at the instigation of Pyotr Badmaev, a Buddhist physician to Tsar Nicholas II.

Cruiser AuroraMUSEUM
(Крейсер Аврора MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-230 8440; www.aurora.org.ru; Petrovskaya nab; adult/child R600/400; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun; c; mGorkovskaya)
Moored on the Bolshaya Nevka, the Aurora had a walk-on part in the communist revolution. On the night of 25 October 1917, its crew fired a blank round from the forward gun as a signal for the start of the assault on the Winter Palace. Restored and painted in pretty colours, it’s a living museum that swarms with kids on weekends.
Artillery MuseumMUSEUM
(Музей Артиллерии MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-232 0296; www.artillery-museum.ru; Kroneverskaya nab; adult/student R400/250; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun; c; mGorkovskaya)
Housed in the fort’s original arsenal, across the moat from the Peter & Paul Fortress, this fire-powered museum chronicles Russia’s military history, with examples of weapons dating all the way back to the Stone Age. The centrepiece is Lenin’s armoured car, which he rode in triumph from the Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal).
MosqueMOSQUE
(Соборная мечеть MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %821-233 9819; http://dum-spb.ru/kontakty; Kronverksky pr 7; h7am-9pm; mGorkovskaya)
This beautiful working mosque (built 1910–14) was modelled on Samarkand’s Gur-e Amir Mausoleum. Its fluted azure dome and minarets are stunning and surprisingly prominent in the city’s skyline. Outside of prayer times, if you are respectfully dressed (women should wear a head covering, men long trousers), you can walk through the gate at the northeast side and ask the guard for entry – the interior is equally lovely.
If you are allowed in, remove your shoes, do not talk and do not take photos.

WORTH A TRIP
STREET ART MUSEUM

You won't regret making the effort to see the magnificent Street Art Museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-448 1593; http://streetartmuseum.ru; shosse Revolutsii 84, Okhta, entrance on Umansky per; adult/student R350/250; hnoon-10pm Tue-Sun May-Sep; mPloshchad Lenina, then bus 28, 37, 137 or 530) set inside a former 11-hectare industrial site. You'll find a wide variety of formats, from huge murals covering walls to mixed-media installations set inside a former boilerhouse. Every year, the exhibition changes, with top artists from around the globe invited to contribute on themes like Revolution (featured in 2017 on the 100-year anniversary of Russia's October Revolution), Migrants and Peace.
Intriguingly, parts of this industrial complex are still active, with workers at the laminated plastics factory SLOPAST surrounded by the encroaching artwork. Some of the workshops are decorated with epic works by the likes of top Russian streets artists Timothy Radya, Kirill Kto and Nikita Nomerz as well as the Spanish artist Escif. Before he died in 2013, Pasha 183 – frequently referred to as Russia's Banksy because of his anonymity – also contributed 'Walls Don't Sleep' a beautiful monochrome mural based on an image of Soviet factory workers.
Guided tours happen on weekends (at 1pm and 2pm); call ahead to ensure an English-speaking guide is on hand. The museum also hosts outdoor concerts and other big events. Check the website for the latest.
It's located in the industrial zone of Okhta, a 20-minute bus ride east of Ploshchad Lenina. Buses 28, 37 and 137 all go there.

WORTH A TRIP
KIROVSKY ISLANDS

If you need a quick break from the city, these three outer delta islands on the Petrograd Side and an ideal place to head. Once marshy forests, the islands were granted to 18th- and 19th-century court favourites and developed into elegant playgrounds. Still mostly parkland, they are leafy venues for picnics, river sports and White Nights’ cavorting, as well as home to St Petersburg’s super rich.
Krestovsky Island (Крестовский остров MAP GOOGLE MAP ; c; mKrestovsky Ostrov) The biggest of the three, Krestovsky consists mostly of the vast Maritime Victory Park (Приморский парк Победы MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.primparkpobedy.ru; Krestovsky pr; mKrestovsky Ostrov), dotted with sports fields; at the far western end is the massive, 68,000-seat Krestovsky Stadium ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mKrestovsky Ostrov), which will play a pivotal role in the 2018 FIFA World Cup. At the park's main entrance opposite the metro station you can rent bikes and in-line skates. Also here is Divo Ostrov ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.divo-ostrov.ru; rides R100-500; hnoon-7pm; c; mKrestovsky Ostrov) is a Disney-style amusement park with exciting fairground rides that kids will adore.
Kamenny Island (Каменный остров MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mChyornaya Rechka) Century-old dacha (country cottages) and mansions, inhabited by very wealthy locals, line the wooded lanes that twist their way around Kamenny (Stone) Island. Punctuated by a series of canals, lakes and ponds, Kameny is pleasant for strolling at any time of year. At its east end, the Church of St John the Baptist ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Kamennoostrovsky pr; h9am-6pm), built in 1776–81, has been charmingly restored.
Car-free Yelagin Island (Елагин остров MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.elaginpark.org; ice skating per hr R200-300; hice skating 11am-9pm; mKrestovsky Ostrov) becomes a winter wonderland in colder temperatures, with sledding, cross-country skiing and ice skating. Skis and skates are available for hire. In summer months, it’s a great place to rent in-line skates.

Attached to the Sokos Hotel Palace Bridge, there's a good gym and a variety of spa treatments here, but the highlights are the giant swimming pool (with jet fountains to massage tired backs) and the many styles of sauna (including Finnish and Russian) in which to steam away all your stresses.
Degtyarniye BathsBATHHOUSE
(Дегтярные Бани MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-985 1983; www.d1a.ru; Degtyarnaya ul 1a; per hr R400-750, private banya R4500-17,500; h8.30am-10pm; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
These modern baths are divided up into men’s and women’s sections, or you can book private unisex bani (hot baths) of varying degrees of luxury (these accommodate up to 14 people). Prices are cheaper before 1pm on weekdays. Minimum charge of two hours.

(Мытнинские бани MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mybanya.spb.ru; ul Mytninskaya 17-19; per hr R200-350; h8am-10pm Fri-Tue; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
Unique in the city, Mytninskiye Bani is heated by a wood furnace, just like the log-cabin bathhouses that are still found in the Russian countryside. It's actually the oldest communal banya (hot bath) in the city, and in addition to a parilka (steam room) and plunge pool, the private ‘lux’ banya (R1000 to R2000 per hour) includes a swanky lounge area with leather furniture and a pool table.
Kazachiye BaniBATHHOUSE
(Казачьи бани MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kazbani.ru; Bolshoy Kazachy per 11; per 2hr R100-300, private banya per hr R850-1700; h8am-10pm Tue-Sun; mPushkinskaya)
Following a trend that is occurring throughout the city, the communal banya is something of an afterthought here. The majority of the venue is given over to very swanky, private bani, which are an excellent option for groups of up to 10 people. The cheaper communal banya is good value though.
Kayaking & Yachting

Yachting and kayaking on Lake Ladoga can be arranged through the friendly and capable guys at Wild Russia. They can also arrange many other outdoor activities including off-road biking, parachuting, quad biking and rock climbing outside the city.
TTours
In a city as large as St Petersburg, a lot of travellers prefer to be shown around on a walking tour to kick things off. There are several excellent ones on offer, as well as bike tours and a hop-on, hop-off bus that can take you around the main sights of the centre. Viewing St Petersburg from a boat is an idyllic way to tour the city, and during the main tourist season (May to October) there are plenty of boats offering to help you do this. They are typically found at the Anichkov most landing on the Fontanka River, just off Nevsky pr; on the Neva outside the Hermitage and the Admiralty; beside the Kazansky most over the Griboyedova Canal; and along the Moyka River at Nevsky pr.
oPeterswalk Walking ToursWALKING
(%812-943 1229; http://peterswalk.com; from R1320)
Going for over 20 years, Peter Kozyrev’s innovative and passionately led tours are highly recommended as a way to see the city with knowledgeable locals.

City TourBUS
(%812-648 1228; https://citytourspb.ru; day pass adult/child R700/300)
The familiar red ‘hop on, hop off’ double-decker buses you’ll see in most big cities in Europe (and beyond) are now well-established in St Petersburg. They offer a useful service for anyone unable to walk easily; buses run along Nevsky pr, passing the Hermitage, going over the Strelka, the Petrograd Side and then back to the historic centre.
Tickets are valid for as many trips in the time period as you like, and you can buy tickets when you board the bus. In summer months they also run a 'hop on, hop off' boat tour (one day bus and boat pass adult/child R1400/700) around the main rivers and canals.

ST PETERSBURG FOR CHILDREN

There are plenty of activities that children will love in St Petersburg, especially during the summer months when the whole city is something of an outdoor playground.
Top museums for children include the Museum of Zoology, with thousands of stuffed animals (including several mammoths) on display; the Railway Museum, where you can see a range of scale locomotives and model railway bridges; and the Central Naval Museum with its superb collection of model boats. Also sure to entrance kids and adults alike are the incredibly detailed scale models of early 18th century St Petersburg at Petrovskaya Akvatoria (Петровская Акватория MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-933 4152; www.peteraqua.ru; Malaya Morskaya ul 4/1; adult/child R400/200; h10am-10pm; mAdmiralteyskaya) and the even more epic model village of Russia's greatest sights at Grand Maket.
One of the best parks to take kids in the city is on New Holland where there's a great kid's playground, a wooden model of a frigate to climb around, a giant chess set and free pétanque (a form of boules). Amusement parks, boats and bikes for hire, and lots of open space make the Kirovsky Islands another great outdoors option.
Wonderful puppet shows can be seen at both the Bolshoy Puppet Theatre (Большой театр кукол MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.puppets.ru; ul Nekrasova 10; tickets R350-600; mChernyshevskaya) and Demmeni Marionette Theatre ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-310 5879; www.demmeni.ru; Nevsky pr 52; htickets from R500; mGostiny Dvor). For traditional-style circus shows the historic St Petersburg State Circus ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-570 5198; www.circus.spb.ru; nab reki Fontanki 3; tickets R500-6000; mGostiny Dvor) can't be beat.
4Sleeping
Hotels in St Petersburg are fairly expensive, with a lack of good midrange places in the city centre. Though they do exist, they tend to get booked up well in advance (particularly during the summer months), so plan ahead if you want to stay in the historic heart.
It is essential to reserve at least a month in advance for accommodation during the White Nights (late May to early July).
The following price ranges refer to the cheapest room available during the high season (May to July).
€ less than R3000
€€ R3000–15,000
€€€ more than R15,000

The owner of Baby Lemonade is crazy about the 1960s and it shows in the pop-art, psychedelic design of this friendly, fun hostel with two pleasant, large dorms and a great kitchen and living room. However, it's worth splashing out for the boutique-hotel-worthy private rooms that are in a separate flat with great rooftop views.
oFriends Hostel by Gostiny DvorHOTEL$$

Sharing the top floor of a renovated historic building with a budget hotel, this is one of the best branches of the Friends chain. There are no dorms here and all the rooms have attached bathrooms, but the same cosy, quirky decorative charm is in place – complete with cuddly toys and flowery print curtains and linens.
oRachmaninov Antique HotelBOUTIQUE HOTEL$$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-327 7466; www.hotelrachmaninov.com; Kazanskaya ul 5; s/d from R6300/7500; iW; mNevsky Prospekt)
The long-established Rachmaninov still feels like a secret place for those in the know. Perfectly located and run by friendly staff, it's pleasantly old world, with hardwood floors and attractive Russian furnishings, particularly in the breakfast salon, which has a grand piano.
Pio on GriboyedovHOTEL$$

There are just six rooms here and three of them share bathrooms and toilets, but it is much more like staying in a large apartment than a hostel. The communal areas are very pleasant and the rooms are comfortable and clean. Even better is the friendly service, central location and big windows overlooking the canal.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-611 1188; www.3mosta.com; nab reki Moyki 3a; s/d from R5000/9000; aW; mNevsky Prospekt)
Near three bridges over the Moyka River, this 26-room property is surprisingly uncramped given its wonderful location. Even the standard rooms are of a good size, with tasteful furniture, minibars and TVs. Some rooms have great views across to the Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood, and all guests have access to the roof for the panoramic experience.

On the 3rd floor of a handsome apartment building with an antique lift, this six-room pension takes its name from the nearby bridge. The standard rooms are fine, but the suites are well worth paying a little more for. The delightful breakfast room with a grand piano offers balcony views. Look for the entrance on Karavannaya ul.

Since 1830, when Carlo Rossi united three adjacent buildings with the grandiose facade we see today, little has been allowed to change in this heritage building. No two rooms are the same at this iconic hotel, but most are spacious and elegant. It's worth paying extra for the terrace rooms, which afford spectacular views across the city's rooftops.

Occupying a beautifully restored building on one of St Petersburg’s prettiest squares, the Rossi's 65 rooms are all designed differently, but their brightness and moulded ceilings are uniform. Antique beds, super-sleek bathrooms, exposed brick walls and lots of cool designer touches create a great blend of old and new.

What the Hotel Astoria has lost of its original Style Moderne decor, it more than compensates for in contemporary style and top-notch service. Little wonder it’s beloved of visiting VIPs, from kings to rock stars. Rooms marry the hotel’s heritage character with a more modern design, while the best suites are sprinkled with antiques and have spectacular views onto St Isaac’s Cathedral.
The same views – at a slightly lower price – are also available next door at its sister property, the Angleterre Hotel ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-494 5607; www.angleterrehotel.com; Malaya Morskaya ul 24; r/ste from R24,545/58,765; aiWs; mAdmiralteyskaya), where guests can use the gym and pool.

Following the formula of other creative clusters around town, this one, behind the post office on ul Vosstaniya, is also home to a hostel. In this case, some thought has been applied to the design of the rooms, each of which has colourful St Petersburg–themed designs on the walls. The location is cool, with boutiques, cafes and a bar on hand.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %911-785 6488; www.redhousehostel.com; 2nd fl, ul Belinskogo 11; dm R550-700; nW; mMayakovskaya)
With its very desirable central location, the Red House Hostel is a fine choice. It's small, and rather cramped with six- to 12-bed dorms, but guests are made to feel right at home in this somewhat bohemian abode. There's a communal kitchen and a washing machine.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-454 5577; www.indigospb.com; ul Chaykovskogo 17, Smolny; r from R10,700; naiW; mChernyshevskaya)
A total overhaul of the original building – a pre-revolutionary hotel in its day – paved the way for the sleek and stylish Hotel Indigo, a big step up from many St Petersburg offerings with its excellent service and handsomely designed guest rooms. The incredible atrium makes even the interior-facing rooms light filled, and touches such as rain showers and free minibars in rooms are also very welcome.

Nils Bed & Breakfast is an excellent option at a great price. Four spacious rooms share two modern bathrooms, as well as a beautiful light-filled common area and kitchen. Nils renovated this place himself, taking great care to preserve the mouldings, wooden floors and other architectural elements.

This lovely lodging is the second Pio property in St Petersburg. It's very spacious, stylish and comfortable, as well as being child friendly, with family groups warmly welcomed and provided for. It's in a quiet, residential neighbourhood a short walk from the Historic Heart. There is also a Finnish sauna on site. Call 10 on the intercom to be buzzed in.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-579 6295; www.ognivo-spb.com; ul Chaykovskogo 4; s/d from R4000/4800)
Ognivo earns high marks for its attractive, well-maintained rooms and quiet location. There's a bit of whimsy to the design in some of the 15 rooms, with inner wooden shutters over the windows, bold wallpaper and wildly patterned tilework in the bathrooms – others have cast-iron chandeliers and wood-beamed ceilings for a more medieval look.

In a grand art nouveau building dating from 1913, the Demetra Art Hotel has plush rooms with oak flooring, richly patterned drapes and duvets, and touches of artwork throughout (reproductions of works from the celebrated Erata Museum). Some rooms can be on the small side, though the top-notch service, stylish bar and restaurant, and great location add to the appeal.

Soul Kitchen blends boho hipness and boutique-hotel comfort, scoring perfect 10s in many key categories: private rooms (chic), dorm beds (double-width with privacy-protecting curtains), common areas and kitchen (all beautifully designed).

There's great value to be had at this centrally located hotel, a conversion of the house where the great writer Nikolai Gogol himself apparently once lived.

Tucked into a quiet courtyard in the narrow streets north of Sennaya pl, this friendly little hotel is a great bargain.

This small, cheerfully decorated mini-hotel has nine rooms tucked inside an apartment building a short stroll from Alexandrovsky Park. It's a colourful, somewhat whimsically decorated place, with repurposed bird cages, hats turned into lamps and bold artwork in some rooms. The friendly service and shared kitchen add to the appeal.

5Eating
There has never been a better time to eat out in St Petersburg. The range and quality of food available seem to increase year on year, making stereotypes about Russian food now seem like bizarre anachronisms. Petersburgers have well and truly caught the foodie bug, and while little of good quality is cheap in this town, the choice is now bigger than ever.
The following price ranges refer to the average cost of a main course.
€ less than R500
€€ R500–1000
€€€ more than R1000
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
LOCAL CHAINS

St Petersburg has a number of home-grown restaurant and cafe chains that are well worth knowing about as they provide cheap and reliable eating options all over town. Chief among these is the now international pie chain Stolle (Штолле; www.stolle.ru), a near-ubiquitous cafe where delicious, moist savoury and sweet pies are available to eat in and take away. Similar and equally numerous is the chain of bakery cafes Bulochnye F. Volcheka (Булочные Ф. Вольчека; www.fvolchek.ru). A couple of other chains to look out for are coffee-and-cake specialists Bushe (Буше; www.bushe.ru) and Baltic Bread (Балтийский Хлеб; www.baltic-bread.ru), which does good sandwiches and pastries.

A perennially popular cafe (expect to wait for a table at peak times) with a cosy feel and an interesting menu, ranging from Japanese-style chicken in teriyaki sauce to potato pancakes with salmon and cream cheese. Well-stocked bookshelves, a range of board games and adorable cuddly toys (each with its own name) encourage lingering.
Jack & ChanINTERNATIONAL$

The restaurant name, a punning reference to Jackie Chan in Russian, neatly sums up the burger-meets-Asian menu at this fine and stylish casual diner. Try the sweet-and-sour fish and the prawn-and-avocado salad with glass noodles.
MarketplaceRUSSIAN, INTERNATIONAL$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://market-place.me; Nevsky pr 24; mains R200-300; h8am-5.30am; Wv; mNevsky Prospekt)
The most central branch of this minichain that brings a high-class polish to the self-serve canteen concept, with many dishes cooked freshly on the spot to order. The hip design of the multilevel space is very appealing, making this a great spot to linger, especially if you indulge in one of the desserts or cocktails served on the 1st floor.
UkropVEGAN$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-946 3035; www.cafe-ukrop.ru; Malaya Konyushennaya ul 14; mains R280-360; h9am-11pm; Wv; mNevsky Prospekt)
Proving veggie, vegan and raw food can be inventive and tasty as well as wholesome, Ukrop (meaning dill) also makes an effort with its bright and whimsical craft design, which includes swing seats and lots of natural materials.
There are other branches on Vasilyevsky Island and ul Vosstaniya.
Cafe HermitageINTERNATIONAL$
(Кафе Эрмитаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-703 7528; General Staff Bldg, 8 Dvortsovaya pl; mains R250-450; h11am-11pm Tue, Thu, Sat & Sun, until 8pm Wed & Fri; mAdmiralteyskaya)
When the east wing of the General Staff Building was turned into a new branch of the Hermitage, they at least made sure it had a decent place to eat (unlike in the Winter Palace). It's a self-serve cafe for drinks, appealing sandwiches and hot dishes and can be visited whether or not you go into the museum itself.
BibliotekaINTERNATIONAL$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-244 1594; www.ilovenevsky.ru; Nevsky pr 20; mains R250-600; h8am-11pm Sun-Thu, to midnight Fri & Sat; W; mNevsky Prospekt)
You could spend the better part of a day here. Ground floor is a waiter-service cafe where it's difficult to avoid being tempted by the cake and dessert display by the door; next up is a more formal restaurant; and on the top floor there's a multiroom lounge bar (closed Monday and Tuesday) with live music and DJs until 1am on Friday and Saturday.

Perfectly placed for eating near the Hermitage, this country-cottage-style restaurant has a very appealing menu of traditional dishes, presented with aplomb.

Anton Abrezov is the talented exec chef behind this Scandi-cool meets Russian locavore restaurant where you can sample dishes such as a delicious corned beef salad with black garlic and pickled vegetables or an upmarket twist on ramen noodles with succulent roast pork.
The connected cocktail bar Madbaren is equally inventive, offering libations such as Siberian Penicillin (horseradish vodka, pollen syrup and rhubarb).

(Гоголь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 6097; http://restaurant-gogol.ru; Malaya Morskaya ul 8; mains R350-690; h9am-3am; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Like its sibling restaurant Chekov, Gogol whisks diners back to the genteel days of pre-revolutionary Russian home dining. The menu comes in a novel, with chapters for each of the traditional courses. Salads, soups, dumplings and classics such as chicken Kiev are all very well done and served in charming, small dining rooms.

Cococo has charmed locals with its inventive approach to contemporary Russian cuisine. Your food is likely to arrive disguised as, say, a small bird's egg, a can of peas or a broken flowerpot – all rather gimmicky, theatrical and fun. The best way to sample what it does is with its tasting menu (R2900). Bookings are advised.

This welcoming, warmly lit space serves outstanding Georgian fare. The recipes aren't overly complicated and the fine ingredients speak for themselves in flavour-rich dishes like aubergine baked with suluguni (a type of cheese), pork dumplings, and tender lamb stew with coriander. Don't miss the excellent khachapuri (cheese bread), which comes in a dozen varieties and is whipped up by the bakers in front.

This vegetarian charmer lives up to its green-minded name, with zesty fresh salads, vegie curries and ingredient-rich soups, plus a menu that takes in Russian, Indian and Italian dishes, all of which are handsomely executed.

Although it opened in 2017, Banshiki has already earned a sterling reputation for its excellent Russian cuisine, serving up a huge variety of nostalgic dishes with a contemporary touch. Everything is made in-house, from its refreshing kvas (fermented rye bread water) to dried meats and eight types of smoked fish. Don't overlook cherry vareniki (dumplings) with sour cream, oxtail ragout or the rich borsch.
Vsyo na Svyom MestyeINTERNATIONAL$$
(Всё на Своём Месте MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-932 0256; Liteyny pr 7; mains R380-740; hnoon-midnight)
A hip little gastrobar with warm ambiance, tables made of converted sewing machines, and a record player providing the tunes.

Combining a love of bicycles and street food from around the globe, Kafe and Bikes serves up delicious cooking amid upbeat grooves, exposed bulbs and those slate grey walls so prevalent in St Petersburg. Shawarmas (grilled meat and salad wrapped in flat bread), wok-fried buckwheat noodles with vegetables, pizzas, khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread) and syrniki (sweet cheese fritters) are all served up in a hurry by friendly staff.

Tucked into an unmarked courtyard off Gorokhovaya, this sprawling restaurant and drinking den is the go-to spot for creatively topped thin-crust pizzas and craft beers. The industrial setting draws a chatty crowd of tatted-up hipsters and style mavens, with a mostly rock soundtrack playing in the background. On warm days you can take a table in the courtyard.

This much-feted, eclectic and original restaurant has got it all just right. The venue itself is a lot of fun to nose around, with multiple small rooms, nooks and crannies.

An old-fashioned elegance prevails at Severyanin, one of the top choices for Russian cuisine near Sennaya pl. Amid vintage wallpaper, mirrored armoires and tasselled lampshades, you might feel like you've stepped back a few decades. Start off with the excellent mushroom soup or borsch (beetroot soup), before moving on to rabbit ragout in puff pastry or Baltic flounder with wine sauce.

Serving all the Russian favourites, this impressive restaurant’s decor combines traditional Zhostovo floral designs and Murano glass chandeliers amid vaulted ceilings and elegantly set tables. It’s popular with theatregoers (reserve ahead in the high season), as it’s an obvious pre- or post-Mariinsky dining option.

Something of an expat favourite, the Idiot is a charming place that has been serving up high-quality Russian fare for years now. The friendly basement location is all about atmosphere, relaxation and fun (encouraged by the complimentary vodka coming with each meal). You can't go wrong here, whether opting for bliny (wheat pancakes) with caviar, grilled trout or pelmeni (Russian-style ravioli) with mushrooms and sour cream.

The interior enjoys a grand old-world dacha feel, as does the menu: rack of lamb in pomegranate sauce, whole fried Gatchina trout and Kamchatka crab with porcini mushrooms take you back to imperial tastes and tsarist opulence.

Shabby chic has never looked so good as it does at this cafe-bar dedicated to the poet Joseph Brodsky (the name is a pun on buterbrod, the Russian word for sandwich), a super-stylish addition to Vasilyevsky Island's eating and drinking scene. The menu runs from excellent smørrebrød (open sandwiches; from R260) to various set meals of salads and soup.

Nearly 20 years on the scene and this excellent place is still going strong. Stylish and airily bright, Restoran is somehow formal and relaxed at the same time.

Despite a totally nondescript appearance from the street, this restaurant’s charming interior perfectly recalls that of a 19th-century dacha and makes for a wonderful setting for a meal. The menu, hidden inside classic novels, features lovingly prepared dishes such as roasted venison with bilberry sauce or Murmansk sole with dill potatoes and stewed leeks.

DINE OR DRINK WITH A VIEW

Making the most of St Petersburg's architectural beauty are these top restaurants, cafes and bars with views:

6Drinking & Nightlife
A city of midnight hedonists, St Petersburg has plenty of bars, pubs and cafes where you can enjoy a craft beer, an aritsan coffee or a strong cocktail at almost any time of day.
You can drink almost everywhere; even in smart restaurants you’re generally welcome to come in and order just a beer, while the city’s best cocktail bars are superb. The centre of the drinking scene is Dumskaya ul and ul Lomonosova, lined with dive bars and dance clubs and a sea of drunken revellers at the weekends.
Historic Heart
oMod ClubBAR, CLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.modclub.info; nab kanala Griboyedova 7; cover R150-350; h6pm-6am; mNevsky Prospekt)

In an area heavily saturated with hipster cafes, Coffee 22 – with its tattooed baristas and service staff, arty decor (piercing portrait of Joseph Brodsky, a rustic wall of dried mosses) and fashion-forward customers – is perhaps the hippest of them all. Listen to its DJs via its mixcloud.com/coffee22 soundtrack.
oTop HopsCRAFT BEER

Boroda means beard in Russian, and sure enough you'll see plenty of facial hair and tattoos in this hipster cocktail hang-out. Never mind, as the mixologists really know their stuff – we can particularly recommend their smoked Old Fashioned, which is infused with tobacco smoke, and their colourful (and potent) range of shots.
oApotheke BarCOCKTAIL BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 1535; http://hatgroup.ru/apotheke-bar; ul Lomonosova 1; h8pm-6am Tue-Sun; mGostiny Dvor)
The antithesis of the nearby dive bars, Apotheke is a calm, cosy cocoon for cocktail connoisseurs. Its slogan is 'think what you drink', so there's no official menu but a friendly young bartender, most likely in a white jacket and sporting a hipster moustache, to make suggestions or simply surprise you.
Pif PafBAR

It's a happening bar, it serves a mean burger and there's a hairdresser at the back – should you fancy a new 'do' part-way through the night. Oh, and there's a fussball table, if conversation lags and you fancy a bit of hand-twisting action.
TanzploshchadkaCLUB
(Танцплощадка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tancplo.com; Konyushennaya pl 2a; h8pm-6am Fri & Sat; mNevsky Prospket)
Beloved by beautiful young things, this is the dance club of the moment with a shabby-chic indoor space beneath a lofty vaulted brick ceiling and plenty of outdoor space should it get too hot inside. Find it at the back, through the archway and courtyard complex south of Konyushennaya pl.

Bookings are essential for this speakeasy cocktail bar styled as a secret poker joint and hidden beneath the Grill Brothers burger restaurant. It's a fun, sophisticated place with the waiters dealing sets of cards to determine your choice of cocktail.
Smolny & Vosstaniya
oHatBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Belinskogo 9; h7pm-5am; mGostiny Dvor)
The wonderfully retro-feeling Hat is a serious spot for jazz and whiskey lovers, who come for the nightly live music and the cool cat crowd that makes this wonderfully designed bar feel like it's been transported out of 1950s Greenwich Village. A very welcome change of gear for St Petersburg's drinking options, but it can be extremely packed at weekends.
oUnion Bar & GrillBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/barunion; Liteyny pr 55; h6pm-4am Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat; W; mMayakovskaya)
The Union is a glamorous and fun place, characterised by one enormous long wooden bar, low lighting and a New York feel. It's all rather adult, with a serious cocktail list and designer beers on tap. The hip 20- and 30-something crowd packs in on weekends to catch live bands, but it's generally quiet during the week.
There's good snack fare (burgers, hummus with pita, shawarma) from the grill in the back room, and a tiny rear patio for the smoking crowd.
oZiferblatANTICAFE
(Циферблат MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-981-180 7022; www.ziferblat.net; 2nd fl, Nevsky pr 81; per min R3, per min after 1st hr R2; h11am-midnight; W; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
A charming multiroom 'free space' that has started a worldwide trend, Ziferblat is the original anticafe in St Petersburg. Coffee, tea, soft drinks and biscuits are included as you while away your time playing chess and other board games, reading, playing instruments (help yourself to the piano and guitar) or just hanging out with the arty young locals who frequent its cosy rooms.
The unsigned entrance is hard to find. Look for the big #81 sign on Nevsky pr, then find the door with buzzers just east of there. Ring Циферблат (labelled in Russian only).
oRedrumBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-416 1126; www.facebook.com/redrumbarspb; ul Nekrasova 26; h4pm-1am Sun-Thu, to 3am Fri & Sat; mMayakovskaya)
One of St Petersburg's best drinking dens, Redrum hits all the right notes. It has a cosy, white brick interior, a welcoming, easygoing crowd, and a stellar selection of craft brews (some two dozen on tap). There's also good pub fare on hand to go with that creative line-up of Session Indian Pale Ales, sour ales, Berliner Weisse and porters.
Have a seat at the small circular bar and get ordering tips from the friendly bartenders, who will be happy to point you in the right direction.
oCommodeBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.commode.club; ul Rubinshteyna 1, 2nd fl; per hr R180; h4pm-2am Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat)
Stopping in for drinks at Commode feels more like hanging out in an upper-class friend's stylish apartment. After getting buzzed up, you can hang out in various high-ceilinged rooms, catch a small concert or poetry slam, browse books in the quasi-library room, play a round of table football, or chat with the easygoing crowd that have fallen for the place.
Drink and snack prices and are kept low (cocktails run R100 to R150), but you'll pay by the hour – not unlike an anticafe – for time spent at this so-called self-cost bar.
GriboyedovCLUB
(Грибоедов MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.griboedovclub.ru; Voronezhskaya ul 2a; hnoon-6am Mon-Fri, from 2pm Sat & Sun; W; mLigovsky Prospekt)
Griboyedov is hands-down the longest-standing and most respected music club in the city. Housed in a repurposed bomb shelter, this one was founded by local ska collective Dva Samolyota. It’s a low-key bar in the early evening, gradually morphing into a dance club later in the night. Admission varies from free to upwards of R400, depending on who's playing or spinning.
ZiferburgANTICAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Fontanki 20; per min R3; h11am-midnight; mGostiny Dvor)
Tucked inside the Golitsyn Loft, this is one of St Petersburg's loveliest spots to while away an afternoon. Elegant furnishings, huge windows and a piano in the corner set the scene. Like other anti-cafes, you'll pay by the minute, with drinks and cookies part of the deal.
The price tops out at R540, meaning you won't pay more than that even if you spend all day here.
Sennaya & Kolomna
Stirka 40BAR
(Стирка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Kazanskaya ul 26; h11am-midnight Sun-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; W; mSennaya Ploshchad)
This friendly joint, whose name means 'washing', has three washing machines, so you can drop off a load and have a few beers while you wait. A novel idea, though one few people seem to take advantage of. Its small and unassuming layout makes it a great place for a quiet drink with a cool young crowd.
SchumliCAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.schumli.ru; Kazanskaya ul 40; h9.30am-10pm Mon-Fri, from noon Sat & Sun; W; mSennaya Ploshchad)
With its large range of coffees, sumptuous selection of cakes and – best of all – freshly made Belgian waffles, this small but friendly cafe is a great place to regain flagging energy when wandering around the city. There's an upstairs dining room for full meals (mains R320 to R640), but coffee with a side of something sweet is the real reason to come.

(Пивной бутик 1516 MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-328 6066; http://butik1516.ru; 9-ya liniya 55; h3-10pm; mVasileostrovskaya)
Your craft-beer cravings are sure to be satisfied at this bar-cum-bottle shop that has dedicated itself to the best of local and international ales. There's usually around 17 beers on tap and 300 or so in bottles to choose from – so it could be a long night.

Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
Big Wine FreaksWINE BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %921-938 6063; Instrumentalnaya ul 3; h6pm-1am Tue-Sat; W)
Boasting a stylish contemporary design, this aptly named place serves an excellent variety of wines from Europe and the New World, plus tasty snacks to go with those tempranillos and chardonnays. Helpful staff – all trained sommeliers – can provide tips on what to order. There's live music, along the lines of acoustic jazz, on Wednesday nights from 8pm.
Double BCAFE
(Даблби MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.double-b.ru; Kronverksky pr; h8am-10pm Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; mGorkovskaya)
One of Petrograd Side's best coffee spots is this hip little cafe on busy Kronverksky pr. Staff can make you a perfect brew with all the essential gadgetry. A green and grey colour scheme, geometric designs, curious lamps and a big picture window make a fine setting for a bit of caffeinated daydreaming.
YasliBAR
(Ясли MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/yaslibar; ul Markina 1; hnoon-midnight Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri & Sat; W; mGorkovskaya)
Tucked down a narrow lane off busy Kronverksky, Yasli makes a fine retreat on chilly nights, with its excellent craft brews on tap and satisfying pub grub (like fish and chips). The setting channels a bit of Brooklyn chic with industrial fixtures and a hip but unpretentious crowd.
Bolshoy BarBAR
(Большой Бар MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshoy pr 45; h9am-1am Sun-Tue, to 4am Wed-Sat; W)
A dapper boxcar-sized spot with old-time music and black-and-white films playing silently in the background, wryly named Bolshoy serves up good coffees by day and first-rate cocktails by night – though daytime drinking isn't discouraged. Slip onto a comfy bar stool and order an Aperol spritz from the talented but bristly bartender.
LGBT ST PETERSBURG

St Petersburg's LGBT nightlife is centred on the large and mainstream club Central Station ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 3600; http://centralstation.ru; ul Lomonosova 1/28; cover after midnight R100-300; h6pm-6am; mNevsky Prospekt) and the more alternative Golubaya Ustritsa ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-921-332 5161; www.boyster.ru; ul Lomonosova 1; h7pm-6am; mGostiny Dvor), a self-styled ‘trash bar’ that guarantees a raucous and cheap night out for anyone. Another option is the long-running Soviet-style club Cabaret (Кабаре MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cabarespb.ru; Razyezzhaya ul 43; cover R300-600; h11pm-6am Thu-Sat; mLigovsky Prospekt) where the 2.30am drag show at weekends is very popular.
There is a busy and growing LGBT scene, but it remains fairly discreet. Gay pride marches are routinely attacked by far right groups and the police often harass protesters. Coming Out (www.comingoutspb.com) is the site of a St Petersburg–based support organisation.
3Entertainment
The classical performing arts are one of the biggest draws in St Petersburg. Highly acclaimed professional artists stage productions in elegant theatres around the city, many of which have been recently revamped and look marvellous.
Historic Heart
oAlexandrinsky TheatreTHEATRE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-710 4103; www.alexandrinsky.ru; pl Ostrovskogo 2; tickets R900-6000; mGostiny Dvor)
This magnificent venue is just one part of an immaculate architectural ensemble designed by Carlo Rossi. The theatre’s interior oozes 19th-century elegance and style, and it’s worth taking a peek even if you don’t see a production here.
New StagePERFORMING ARTS
(Новая сцена MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-401 5341; http://alexandrinsky.ru; nab reki Fontanki 49a; mGostiny Dvor)
The New Stage at Alexandrinsky, which opened in 2013, is a strikingly modern building for the historic city center but one that keeps a low profile due to the architect's ingenious use of glass and a secluded courtyard space. Come here to see contemporary dance, music, film, lectures and other events.
oMikhailovsky TheatrePERFORMING ARTS
(Михайловский театр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-595 4305; www.mikhailovsky.ru; pl Iskusstv 1; tickets R500-5000; mNevsky Prospekt)
This illustrious stage delivers the Russian ballet or operatic experience, complete with multitiered theatre, frescoed ceiling and elaborate productions. Pl Iskusstv (Arts Sq) is a lovely setting for this respected venue, which is home to the State Academic Opera & Ballet Company.
Shostakovich PhilharmoniaCLASSICAL MUSIC
(Санкт-Петербургская филармония им. Д.Д.Шостаковича MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.philharmonia.spb.ru; tickets R800-2500; mNevsky Prospekt)
Under the artistic direction of world-famous conductor Yury Temirkanov, the Philharmonia represents the finest in orchestral music. The Bolshoy Zal (Большой зал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-240 0180; Mikhailovskaya ul 2; mNevsky Prospekt) is the venue for a full program of symphonic performances, while the nearby Maly Zal (Малый Зал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-571 8333; Nevsky pr 30; mGostiny Dvor) hosts smaller ensembles. Both venues are used for numerous music festivals.
Smolny & Vosstaniya
CosmonautLIVE MUSIC
(Космонавт MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cosmonavt.su; ul Bronnitskaya 24; tickets R300-800; W; mTekhnologichesky Institut)
This fantastic conversion of a Soviet-era cinema in a rather nondescript part of town is a great venue for medium-sized concerts and a good place to see live acts in St Petersburg. There’s air-conditioning, which is a godsend in summer, and a very comfortable VIP lounge upstairs, with seating throughout.
Fish FabriqueLIVE MUSIC
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://fishfabrique.ru; Ligovsky pr 53; hnoon-4am daily, concerts from 8pm Thu-Sun; W; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
There are St Petersburg institutions and then there’s Fish Fabrique, the museum of local boho life that has been going for over two decades. Here, in the dark underbelly of Pushkinskaya 10, artists, musicians and counter-culturalists of all ages meet to drink beer and listen to music.
Maly Drama TheatreTHEATRE
(Малый драматический театр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mdt-dodin.ru; ul Rubinshteyna 18; mVladimirskaya)
Also called the Theatre of Europe, the Maly is St Petersburg’s most internationally celebrated theatre. Its director Lev Dodin is famed for his long version of Fyodor Dostoevsky’s The Devils, as well as Anton Chekhov’s Play Without a Name, both of which toured the world to great acclaim. It's also one of the few theatres that does (some) performances with subtitles.
Jazz Philharmonic HallJAZZ
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.jazz-hall.com; Zagorodny pr 27; cover R1200-1500; hconcerts 7pm or 8pm Wed-Sun; mVladimirskaya)
Founded by legendary jazz violinist and composer David Goloshchokin, this venue represents the more traditional side of jazz. Two resident bands perform straight jazz and Dixieland in the big hall, which seats up to 200 people. The smaller Ellington Hall is used for occasional acoustic performances. Foreign guests also appear doing mainstream and modern jazz; check the website for details.
JFC Jazz ClubJAZZ
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-272 9850; www.jfc-club.spb.ru; Shpalernaya ul 33; cover R200-500; h7-10pm; mChernyshevskaya)
Very small and very New York, this cool club is the best place in the city to hear modern, innovative jazz music, as well as blues, bluegrass and various other styles (see the website for a list of what’s on). The space is tiny, so book a table online if you want to sit down.
DON'T MISS
MARIINSKY THEATRE

The Mariinsky Theatre (Мариинский театр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-326 4141; www.mariinsky.ru; Teatralnaya pl 1; tickets R1200-6500; mSadovaya) has played a pivotal role in Russian ballet and opera ever since it was built in 1859 and remains one of Russia's most loved and respected cultural institutions. Its pretty green-and-white main building on aptly named Teatralnaya pl (Theatre Sq) is a must for any visitor wanting to see one of the world's great ballet and opera stages, while its newer second stage, the Mariinsky II (Мариинский II MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-326 4141; www.mariinsky.ru; ul Dekabristov 34; tickets R350-6000; hticket office 11am-7pm; mSadovaya), is a state-of-the-art opera house for the 21st century.
The best way to experience these buildings is to see an opera or ballet. Outside performance times you can wander into the theatre’s foyer and maybe peep into the lovely auditorium. Private tours are sometimes available – ask at the main ticket office if these are running during your visit.
Known as the Kirov Ballet during the Soviet era, the Mariinsky has an illustrious history, with troupe members including such ballet greats as Nijinsky, Nureyev, Pavlova and Baryshnikov. In recent years the company has been invigorated by the current Artistic and General Director Valery Gergiev. It is pretty certain that the Mariinsky Theatre will close at some point in 2018 or 2019 for a full (and, again, much needed) renovation, so visit the building's faded grandeur while you can.
Sennaya & Kolomna
Rimsky-Korsakov ConservatoryCLASSICAL MUSIC
(Консерватория имени Н. А. Римского-Корсакова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 2519; www.conservatory.ru; Teatralnaya pl 3; tickets R300-2000; mSadovaya)
This illustrious music school was the first public music school in Russia. The Bolshoy Zal (Big Hall) on the 3rd floor is an excellent place to see performances by up-and-coming musicians throughout the academic year, while the Maly Zal (Small Hall) often hosts free concerts from present students and alumni; check when you’re in town for what’s on.
Mariinsky Concert HallCLASSICAL MUSIC
(Мариинский концертный зал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mariinsky.ru; ul Dekabristov 37; tickets R700-1800; hticket office 11am-8pm; mSadovaya)
Opened in 2007, this concert hall is a magnificent multifaceted creation. It manages to preserve the historic brick facade of the set and scenery warehouse that previously stood on this spot, while the modern main entrance, facing ul Dekabristov, is all tinted glass and angular lines, hardly hinting at the beautiful old building behind.
Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
Hi-HatLIVE PERFORMANCE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/hihatrooftop; Aptekarsky pr 4; mPetrogradskaya)
On the rooftop of an art cluster near the Botanical Gardens, Hi-Hat hosts nights of live music, DJs and open-air film screenings. The creative line-up and open-air setting draws out style mavens and a party-minded crowd. The schedule is erratic, but events typically run from 5pm or 6pm to around 1am on Fridays and Saturdays (with the odd Sunday and Thursday happening). Check the website for the schedule.
A2LIVE MUSIC

With an outstanding sound system and an eclectic line-up of live music and DJs, A2 is one of the best venues for contemporary sounds in the city. It houses two concert halls (seating 1500 and 5000) and has a staggering number of bars sprinkled about the complex.
KamchatkaCLUB, LIVE MUSIC
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.clubkamchatka.ru; ul Blokhina 15; cover R250-350; h7pm-2am; mSportivnaya)
A shrine to Viktor Tsoy, the late Soviet-era rocker who worked as caretaker of this former boilerhouse bunker with band mates from Kino. Music lovers flock here to light candles and watch a new generation thrash out their stuff. The line-up is varied and it's worth dropping by if only for a quick drink in this highly atmospheric place – find it tucked in a courtyard off the street.
7Shopping

oAu Pont RougeDEPARTMENT STORE

DON'T MISS
HISTORIC SHOPS OF NEVSKY PROSPEKT

Nikolai Gogol described it as 'Petersburg's universal channel of communication' in his story Nevsky Prospekt. Some 300 years on from its creation, little has changed. Nevsky remains the city's most famous street, running 4.7km from the Admiralty to the Alexandr Nevsky Monastery, from which it takes its name. Taking a stroll along it is an essential St Petersburg experience and particularly special at dusk as the low light casts shadows and picks out silhouettes from the elegant mix of architecture.
The inner 2.5km to Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal) is the city's prime shopping drag that pulses with street life. Here you'll find baroque palaces, churches in a range of denominations, all manner of entertainments and, above all, shops, some historic in their own right. These are the key ones not to miss:
ASinger Building ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 28; mNevsky Prospekt) The former headquarters of the Singer sewing machine company, which opened a factory in the Russian capital in 1904, is one of St Petersburg’s most gorgeous buildings. Its Style Modern architecture, designed by Pavel Suzor, and topped with a glass tower and scuplture, also housed the American consulate for a few years prior to WWI. It's possible to access the offices part of the building including the interior of the glass dome on a tour (R6000 for up to three people) organised with Placemates (%925 845 3747; http://placemates.ru; prices vary).
ABolshoy Gostiny Dvor (Большой Гостиный Двор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-630 5408; http://bgd.ru; Nevsky pr 35; h10am-10pm; mGostiny Dvor) One of the world’s first indoor shopping malls, the ‘Big Merchant Yard’ dates from between 1757 and 1785 and stretches 230m along Nevsky pr (its perimeter is more than 1km long). This Rastrelli creation is not as elaborate as some of his other work, finished as it was by Vallin de la Mothe in a more sober neoclassical style. At its height at the turn of the 20th century, Gostiny Dvor contained over 170 shops.
APassage (Пассаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-313 7400; http://passage.spb.ru; Nevsky pr 48; h10am-9pm; mGostiny Dvor) Built between 1846 and 1848, this arcade has a glass roof spanning the entire block from Nevsky to Italiyanskaya ul. Dostoevsky wrote a story about a man who was swallowed by a crocodile in Passage, after a live crocodile was exhibited here in 1864. Look for the small exhibition on the 1st floor with historical photos and other items related to the arcade. The handsomely restored ground floor has several good souvenir and antique shops.
AKupetz Eliseevs ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-456 6666; www.kupetzeliseevs.ru; Nevsky pr 56; h10am-11pm; W; mGostiny Dvor) This Style Moderne stunner is St Petersburg's most elegant grocery store. Built in 1904 as the flagship of the Eliseev Brothers' highly successful chain of food emporiums, little expense or design flourish was spared in its construction. In recent years the building has been restored to its full grandeur with huge plate-glass windows providing glimpses into a dazzling interior of stained glass, chandeliers, polished brass and a giant pineapple palm. The building's exterior is no less lavish, graced with four allegorical sculptures representing industry, trade and commerce, art and science. The building also included a theatre, which is still functioning.
Smolny & Vosstaniya
PhonotekaMUSIC
(Фонотека MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.phonoteka.ru; ul Marata 28; h10am-10pm; mMayakovskaya)
This cool store will thrill anyone interested in music and cinema, as it sells a very cool range of vinyls from all eras (it’s particularly strong on rare Soviet discs), a great selection of CDs from around the world and a discerning choice of film and documentary on DVD, making it an excellent place to buy Russian films.
AngliaBOOKS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Fontanki 30; h10am-8pm Mon-Fri, from 11am Sat, noon-7pm Sun; mGostiny Dvor)
The city’s only dedicated English-language bookshop has a good selection of contemporary literature, classics, dictionaries, history and travel writing – plus a dedicated section on Russia. It also hosts small art and photography displays, organises book readings and generally is a cornerstone of expat life in St Petersburg.
Imperial PorcelainHOMEWARES
(Императорский Фарфор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.ipm.ru; Vladimirsky pr 7; h10am-8pm; mVladimirskaya)
This is one of many convenient city-centre locations of the famous porcelain factory that once made tea sets for the Romanovs. If you’re determined to get a bargain, head out to the factory outlet (Императорский Фарфор GOOGLE MAP ; www.ipm.ru; pr Obukhovsky Oborony 151; h10am-8pm; mLomonosovskaya) where prices are a bit cheaper.
GaleriaSHOPPING CENTRE
(Галерея MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.galeria.spb.ru; Ligovsky pr 30A; h10am-11pm; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
This extraordinary place has rather changed everything for shopping in St Petersburg – there are probably as many shops here as elsewhere in the entire city centre. Spread over five floors, with around 300 shops (including H&M, Michael Kors, Marks & Spencer, Kiehl's and Zara), this really is a one-stop shop for pretty much all your shopping needs.

RediskаARTS & CRAFTS

Near the courtyard of the Berthold Centre, this delightful shop has lots of eye-catching objects, much of it made in-house or produced by St Petersburg artisans. You'll find jewellery imprinted with famous paintings, whimsical wooden clocks, ceramics, tiny Konstructor kits (a kind of miniature Lego), artfully painted flasks, backpacks, sunglasses and handmade soaps, lotions and candles.
NorthwayGIFTS & SOUVENIRS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Angliyskaya nab 36/2; h9am-8pm; mAdmiralteyskaya)
There is quite simply no bigger collection of matryoshki (nesting dolls), amber, fur and other Russian souvenir staples than that on offer at this very impressive and stylish shop right on the Neva embankment. Look no further for Russian gifts to take home.
WORTH A TRIP
UDELNAYA FAIR

This weekend market (Удельная ярмарка GOOGLE MAP ; Skobolvesky pr, Vyborg Side; h8am-5pm Sat & Sun; mUdelnaya) is a treasure trove of Soviet ephemera, prerevolutionary antiques, WWII artefacts and bonkers kitsch from all eras is truly worth travelling to see. Exit the metro station to the right and follow the crowds across the train tracks. Continue beyond the large permanent market, which is of very little interest, until you come to a huge area of independent stalls, all varying in quality and content.
8Information
DANGER & ANNOYANCES
AForeigners tend to find Russians quite brusque and even unfriendly. Remember, this is a cultural thing, and try not to be offended by it. Russians take a while to warm up, but when they do they're exceptionally friendly.
AThere has been an ongoing epidemic of racist attacks in St Petersburg. If you look very obviously non-Russian, it's a good idea to avoid the suburbs and take taxis at night.
ADue to legislation criminalising the 'promotion of homosexuality' to minors, levels of homophobia are higher now than they have been for some time. Gay travellers are advised to remain discreet.
DISCOUNT CARDS
If you’re a student, bring an International Student Identity Card (ISIC) to get discounts – cards issued by non-Russian universities will not always be accepted. The Hermitage is the blissful exception, where anyone with a student card from any country gets in for free. Senior citizens (usually anyone over the age of 60) are often also eligible for discounts, so bring your passport with you as proof of age.
The St Petersburg Card (https://petersburgcard.com) is sold online and by the St Petersburg Tourist Centre. It gives a range of discounts on tours and sights such as the Hermitage, Peterhof and Tsarskoe Selo (the savings aren't huge), as well as acting as a stored-value card for public transport.

INTERNET ACCESS
Internet access is excellent and practically universal. Nearly all hotels have free wireless internet. Many restaurants, cafes, bars and clubs also have wi-fi. You may have to ask for a password (parol) to get online, and also input your mobile phone number. Sometimes this will need to be a Russian number (ie one starting with 7); if you don't have one, ask a local if you can use their number.
MEDIA
There is no English-language newspaper but the free bimonthly In Your Pocket (www.inyourpocket.com) magazine is worth picking up for events listings and other background information.
MEDICAL SERVICES

Smaller post offices may refuse to send parcels internationally; most importantly, your package is more likely to reach its destination if you send it from the main post office. You will need to provide a return address in St Petersburg – your hotel name will be fine.
TOILETS
Around nearly all metro stations and tourist attractions there’s at least one blue Portakabin-type toilet staffed by an attendant who will charge you around R35 for the honour of using it. There are also pay toilets in all main-line train stations and free ones in museums. As a general rule, it’s far better to stop for a drink in a cafe or duck into a fancy hotel and use their cleaner facilities.
TOURIST INFORMATION
Tourist information is halfway decent in St Petersburg. In addition to the Tourist Information Bureau's main office ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-303 0555, 812-242 3909; http://eng.ispb.info; Sadovaya ul 14/52; h10am-7pm Mon-Sat; mGostiny Dvor), just off Nevsky pr in the Historic Heart, there is an office in Smolny ( GOOGLE MAP ; pl Vosstaniya; h10am-7pm; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), and kiosks at Palace Square ( GOOGLE MAP ; %8-931-326 5744; Dvortsovaya pl; h10am-7pm; mAdmiralteyskaya), St Isaac's Cathedral ( GOOGLE MAP ; Isaakievskaya pl; h10am-7pm; mAdmiralteyskaya) and Pulkovo Airport ( GOOGLE MAP ; h9am-8pm).

8Getting There & Away
AIR
Most travellers arrive in St Petersburg at Pulkovo International Airport (LED; GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 3822; www.pulkovoairport.ru; Pulkovskoye sh), 23km south of the city. This terminal building, which opened in 2014, and is confusingly still referred to as Terminal 1, handles all domestic and international flights and is St Petersburg's only airport.
BOAT
Cruise ships dock at one of the following:
Marine Facade Terminal (Пассажирский Порт Санкт-Петербург Морской Фасад GOOGLE MAP ; %812-303 6740; www.portspb.ru; 1 Bereg Nevskoy gubi; mPrimorskaya)
Sea Port (Морской вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 2060; www.mvokzal.ru; pl Morskoy Slavy 1)
English Embankment Passenger Terminal ( GOOGLE MAP )

River Passenger Terminal (Речной вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; %812-262 6321, 812-262 0239; Obukhovskoy Oborony pr 195; mProletarskaya)
You can buy ferry tickets for nearly all boats at the Ferry Centre (Паромный центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-327 3377; www.paromy.ru; ul Vosstaniya 19; h10am-7pm Mon-Fri; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), a short walk from the Moscow Station. Alternatively, it’s possible to buy ferry tickets in the Sea Port, as well as online through the ferry companies themselves.
BUS
St Petersburg’s main bus station, Avtovokzal (Автобусный вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; %812-766 5777; www.avokzal.ru; nab Obvodnogo kanala 36; mObvodny Kanal), has bus connections to cities all over western Russia, including Veliky Novgorod, but most travellers won’t use it. If you do happen to arrive here, it’s a short walk along the canal to the metro station Obvodny Kanal (Line 5).
Lux Express ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-441 3757; www.luxexpress.eu; nab Obvodnogo kanala 36; h9am-9pm; mBaltiyskaya) runs buses from both Avtovokzal and from outside the Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal). Its buses run to Tallinn (from R1950, seven daily, seven hours), Rīga (from R2275, four daily, 11 hours) and Helsinki (from R1650, three daily, 7½ hours).
Ecolines ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-409 9410; www.ecolines.ru; Podezdny per 3; h8am-10pm; mPushkinskaya) runs daily buses from the Vitebsk Station to Tallinn (R1210, five daily, seven hours), Rīga (R2240, four daily, 11 hours), Minsk (R2130, three daily, 14 hours), Prague (R6130, two to three daily, 36 to 38 hours) and Berlin (R6840, two to three daily, 34 hours).
Transgold (%812-995 0605; www.transgold.ru) runs door-to-door marshrutky (minibuses) to and from Helsinki and other destinations in Finland from R1300.
CAR & MOTORCYCLE
The most convenient border crossing from Estonia when driving to St Petersburg is Narva. You can avoid queues by booking a time slot for your crossing from (but not into) Estonia for a small fee at www.estonianborder.eu.
Heading to the city from Finland, highways cross the Finnish border posts of Nuijamaa and Vaalimaa (Brusnichnoe and Torfyanovka, respectively, on the Russian side).
TRAIN
Buying train tickets in person can be done at any train station (even at a different terminus from where your train departs), although waiting time can be long if you buy them at a counter. Far quicker are the ticket machines, which all work in English and where you can usually pay in both cash and by credit card. Another option is the centrally located Train Tickets Centre (Кассы ЖД GOOGLE MAP ; nab kanala Griboyedova 24; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, until 6pm Sun; mGostiny Dvor), where there are also ticket machines, which makes waiting in line unnecessary.
HISTORIC RAILWAY STATIONS

As the birthplace of Russia’s railway system, it’s not surprising that St Petersburg has some grand stations. The oldest and most elegant is the Vitebsk Station (Vitebsky vokzal; Витебский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; Zagorodny pr 52; mPushkinskaya), originally built in 1837 for the tsar’s private train line to Tsarskoe Selo. The current building dates from 1904 and is partly graced with gorgeous Style Moderne interiors.
While you’re at the Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal; Московский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; www.moskovsky-vokzal.ru; Nevsky pr 85; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), look up at the expansive ceiling mural in the main entrance hall. There’s also a striking giant bust of Peter the Great in the hall leading to the platforms.
The Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal; Финляндский вокзал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Lenina 6; mPloshchad Lenina), rebuilt in the 1970s in rectilinear Soviet style, is where Lenin finally arrived in 1917 after 17 years in exile abroad. Here he gave his legendary speech from the top of an armoured car to a crowd who had heard of, but never seen the man. After fleeing a second time he again arrived here from Finland, this time disguised as a railway fireman, and the locomotive he rode in is displayed behind glass on the platform. Walk out onto the square that still bears Lenin’s name and you’ll see a marvellous statue of the man himself at the far end.
Stations
Trains from Helsinki arrive at the Finland Station. From here you can connect to anywhere in the city by metro from the Ploshchad Lenina station (Line 1) on the square outside the station.
Some trains from the Leningradskaya Oblast and those from Helsinki to Moscow stop en route in St Petersburg at the Ladoga Station (Ladozhsky vokzal; Ладожский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://lvspb.ru; Zanevsky pr 73; mLadozhskaya) (Ladozhsky vokzal). It’s served by the Ladozhskaya metro station (Line 4).
If you’re arriving from Moscow, you’ll come to the Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal), in the centre of the city. There are two metro stations close by: pl Vosstaniya (Line 1) and Mayakovskaya (Line 3). To get here (you can enter both stations through one building) turn left outside the main entrance to the Moscow Station, and the exit is on one side of the building on Ligovsky pr.
Moscow
There are about 10 overnight trains travelling between St Petersburg and Moscow. Most depart between 10pm and 1am, arriving in the capital the following morning between 6am and 8am. On the more comfortable firmeny trains, such as the Red Arrow (Красная стрела) or Grand Express (ГРАНД ЭКСПРЕСС) a de-luxe sleeping carriage is between R12,800 and R16,400, 1st-class compartment (two-person cabin) around R16,300, while a 2nd-class kupe (four-person cabin) is R2800. Less fancy trains offer 3rd-class platzkartny (dorm-style sleeping carriages) for R1570 and even sitting-only carriages for R890.
Sapsan high-speed trains travel at 200km/h to reach Moscow in around four hours. There are six to eight daily departures. Comfortable 2nd-class seats start at R1300, while super-spacious 1st-class seats run from R5000.
Elsewhere in Russia
St Petersburg has excellent connections to the rest of European Russia, with daily trains to Murmansk, Petrozavodsk, Kaliningrad, Nizhny Novgorod, Novgorod, Pskov and Yekaterinburg. Less frequent services connect the city to Arkhangelsk and Kazan. Southern Russia and Siberia are generally reached via Moscow, although there are some direct trains to the Black Sea coast from St Petersburg. However, be aware that these cut through Belarus, necessitating a transit visa for Belarus and a double entry visa.
Finland & Other International Destinations
From Helsinki there are four daily Allegro express trains that take you from the Finnish capital to St Petersburg in an impressive 3½ hours; see www.vr.fi for prices and timetables. Services in both directions stop at Vyborg.
St Petersburg is well connected by train to lots of cities throughout Eastern Europe, including Berlin, Budapest, Kaliningrad, Kyiv, Prague and Warsaw, but all trains pass through Belarus, for which you’re required to hold a transit visa. The train to Smolensk in Russia also passes through Belarus.
8Getting Around
TO/FROM THE AIRPORT
An official taxi to the centre should cost between R800 and R1000; if you book one via an app, it's likely to be R700. Alternatively, take bus 39 (35 minutes) or 39A (20 minutes) to Moskovskaya metro station for R35, then take the metro from Moskovskaya (Line 2) all over the city for R45.
BICYCLE
Despite the local traffic being still in the learning stages about basic respect for cyclists, this is a great way to get around this huge and flat city.
Some youth hostels and bike shops, such as Rentbike ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-981 0155; www.rentbike.org; Naberezhnaya fontanki 77; per hr/day from R100/500; h10am-10pm; mSennaya Ploshchad) and Skladnye Velosipedy (Складные Велосипеды MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-748 1407; www.shulzbikes.ru; Goncharnaya ul 20; bike hire per day/24 hr R700/1000; h11am-9pm), hire bikes for as little as R500 per day.
If you're keen to do a lot of cycling, bring a helmet, bike lights and a good lock from home, as these are hard to come by.
Velogorod (%812-648 2100; http://spb.velogorod.org; ride/day pass R45/129) is a handy bike-sharing system with 56 stations across the city. You'll need to use the website or download the app to hire one of their bicycles.
BUS, MARSHRUTKA, TROLLEYBUS & TRAM
Buses and, particularly marshrutky (minibuses), are a very handy way to get around the city and they tend to cover routes that the metro doesn’t, making them essential for certain parts of town. Most travellers find taking them a bit daunting, however, as there’s little signage in English. On both buses and trolleybuses, you get on and then pay a conductor; the fare is R40. Marshrutky rates are usually posted on the inside of the bus near the driver.
Increasingly rare, trams are still useful in areas such as Kolomna and Vasilyevsky Island where there is little else available.
Useful routes include:
Tram 6 Great for travelling between areas north of the river without going through the centre: connects Vasilyevsky Island with the Petrograd Side and the Vyborg Side.
Trolleybus 7 Goes from Smolny along Nevsky pr, over the river, along the Strelka and to the Petrograd Side.
CAR
You can hire cars from the major international agencies such as Avis ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-600 1213; www.avisrussia.ru; pl Alexandra Nevskogo 2; h9am-9pm; mpl Alexandra Nevskogo) and Hertz ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-454 7099; www.hertz.ru; Pulkovskoe sh 41) as well as local operations to get around the city and further afield.
For something a little different, you can rent vintage cars, including retro Soviet models such as Chaikas and Volgas, from Retro v Mode (Ретро в моде MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-927 1837; www.retrovmode.ru; office 16, Korpus 6, Ligovsky pr 50; h10am-1pm & 2-8pm). Rates start around R1500 per hour and they can also arrange drivers.
METRO
The St Petersburg Metro (%8-800- 350 1155; www.metro.spb.ru; h6am-12.45am) is a very efficient five-line system. The network of some 70 stations is most usefully employed for travelling long distances, especially connecting the suburbs to the city centre. New stations are being added and it's possible that the one at Teatralnaya, next to the Mariinsky Theatre, will be operational by 2020.
Look for signs with a big blue ‘M’ signifying the entrance to the metro. The flat fare for a trip is R45; you will have to buy an additional ticket if you are carrying a significant amount of baggage. If you wish to buy a single journey, ask for ‘adin proyezd’ and you will be given a zheton (token) to put in the machine.
If you are staying more than a day or two, however, it’s worth buying a smart card (R60), which is good for multiple journeys to be used over the course of a fixed time period – for example, 10 trips in seven days for R355. Their main advantage is that you won’t have to line up to buy tickets – the ticket counters can have very long lines during peak hours.
The metro system is fully signed in English, so it’s quite easy to use, even for first-timers in Russia.
TAXI
Taxi apps, such as Gett and Yandex Taxi, are all the rage in St Petersburg and they've brought down the prices of taxis in general, while improving the service a great deal.
Aside from the apps, the best way to get a taxi is to order it by phone. Operators will usually not speak English, so unless you speak Russian, ask your hotel reception to call a taxi for you. It also remains possible to flag down a random car in the street and negotiate the price, keeping in mind all security caveats.
Peterburgskoe Taksi 068 (%812-324 7777, in St Petersburg 068; www.taxi068.ru)
Taxi-4 (%812-333 4333; www.taxi-4.ru)
Taxi Blues (Такси-Блюз %812-321 8888; www.taxiblues.ru)
Taxi 6000000 (%812-600 0000; http://6-000-000.ru) Has operators and drivers who speak English.

RAISING THE BRIDGES

From mid-April until late November major bridges across the Neva rise roughly between 1.30am and 5am to allow ships to sail through the city. Check the timetable at www.razvodka-mostov.ru (in Russian only). Because of the new fixed suspension bridges on the Western High Speed Diameter highway across the mouth of the Neva you will not be stuck either side of the river when the bridges go up. Note also that between May and the end of November the M5 metro line shuttles every 20 minutes back and forth between Admiralteyskaya and Sportivnaya stations between 1am and 3am on Saturday and Sunday and the eve of public holidays, creating an easy way to get between the islands and the Historic Heart.

AROUND ST PETERSBURG
There are several grand imperial palaces and estates surrounding St Petersburg. Peterhof and the palace-park ensembles at Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk are the best and a visit to St Petersburg is not complete without a trip to at least one of them. Be warned that at the height of summer the endless tourist crowds can be frustrating. Moreover, while Peterhof is the most impressive palace, it’s overpriced for foreigners. Tsarskoe Selo is the best value-for-money day trip.
If your time is short, or you wish to avoid the long queues at the palaces, book yourself into a guided tour of Peterhof, Tsarskoe Selo or Pavlovsk with a travel agency, and make sure that they book your entry ticket for you. Peter’s Walking Tours in St Petersburg can do this for you.

Peterhof Петергоф
%812 / POP 73,400
Hugging the Gulf of Finland, 29km west of St Petersburg, Peterhof – the ‘Russian Versailles’ – is a far cry from the original cabin Peter the Great had built here to oversee construction of the Kronshtadt naval base. Peter liked the place so much he built a villa, Monplaisir, here and then a whole series of palaces and ornate gardens. Peterhof was renamed Petrodvorets (Peter’s Palace) in 1944 but has since reverted to its original name. The palace and buildings are surrounded by leafy gardens and a spectacular ensemble of gravity-powered fountains.
What you see today is largely a reconstruction, as Peterhof was a major casualty of WWII. Apart from the damage done by the Germans, the palace suffered the worst under Soviet bombing raids in December 1941 and January 1942, because Stalin was determined to thwart Hitler’s plan of hosting a New Year’s victory celebration here.
1Sights
oLower ParkPARK
(Нижний парк GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhofmuseum.ru; adult/student May-Oct R750/400, Nov-Apr free; h9am-7pm)
One of the greatest attractions outside of St Petersburg is the jaw-dropping collection of gilded fountains, statue-lined lanes, and picturesque canals that make up the Lower Park of Peterhof. Even if you'd rather not brave the crowds to visit the palace, it's still well worth a visit here, to see its over-the-top Grand Cascade ( GOOGLE MAP ; h11am-5pm Mon-Fri, to 6pm Sat & Sun May-Oct) and other water features, including trick fountains that douse unsuspecting visitors.
oGrand PalacePALACE
(Большой дворец GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhofmuseum.ru; ul Razvodnaya; adult/student R700/400, audio guide R600; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun, closed last Tue of month)
The Grand Palace is an imposing building, although with just 30-something rooms, it is not nearly as large as your typical tsarist palace. From the start of June to the end of September it is open to foreign tourists only between noon and 2pm, and again from 4.15pm to 5.45pm (to 7.45pm on Saturdays), due to guided tours being only in Russian at other times (it is quite possible to leave your group, however).
While Peter’s palace was relatively modest, Rastrelli grossly enlarged the building for Empress Elizabeth. Later, Catherine the Great toned things down a little with a redecoration, although that’s not really apparent from the glittering halls and art-filled galleries that are visible today. All the paintings, furniture and chandeliers are original, as everything was removed from the premises before the Germans arrived in WWII. The Chesme Hall is full of huge paintings of Russia’s destruction of the Turkish fleet at Çesme in 1770. Other highlights include the exquisite East and West Chinese Cabinets, the Picture Hall and Peter’s Study. The Throne Room is the biggest in the palace, with Peter's red velvet throne as centrepiece, while the Picture Hall lives up to its name, with hundreds of portraits crowding its walls.
After WWII, Peterhof was largely left in ruins. Hitler had intended to throw a party here when his plans to occupy the Astoria Hotel were thwarted. He drew up pompous invitations, which obviously incensed his Soviet foes. Stalin’s response was to pre-empt any such celebration by bombing the estate himself, in the winter of 1941–42, so it is ironic but true that most of the damage at Peterhof occurred at the hands of the Soviets. What you see today is largely a reconstruction; the main palace was completely gutted and only a few of its walls were left standing.
Park AlexandriaPARK
(Парк Александрия GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R300/200; h9am-10pm)
Even on summer weekends, the rambling and overgrown Park Alexandria is peaceful and practically empty. Built for Tsar Nicholas I (and named for his tsarina), these grounds offer a sweet retreat from the crowds. Originally named for Alexander Nevsky, the Gothic chapel ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R300/200; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun) was completed in 1834 as the private chapel of Nicholas I. Nearby is the cottage (Коттедж GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun) that was built around the same time as his summer residence.
PETERHOF TICKETS & OPENING HOURS

Inexplicably, many museums within the Peterhof estate have different closing days, although all the buildings are open from Friday to Sunday. With the exception of the Grand Palace, most buildings are open only at weekends between October and April, and some are closed entirely out of season. In any case, it’s extraordinarily expensive to see all the attractions from the inside, as they each charge separate hefty admission fees, plus an extra ticket to take photographs or videos – on top of which you’re paying at least 75% more than locals. There are some joint tickets to several sights, which save you something, but sadly there's no general ticket available. Nearly all tours and posted information is in Russian, so it’s worth investing in an information booklet, available at the kiosks near the entrances.
The lovely Upper Garden is free. Admission to the Lower Park is payable at the cash booths on the jetty and outside the gates leading to the Grand Cascade. There's no re-entering the park; if you leave the grounds, you'll have to purchase another ticket to get back in.
4Sleeping & Eating
New Peterhof HotelHOTEL$$
( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-319 1010; www.new-peterhof.com; Sankt Peterburgsky pr 34; s/d from R5000/5900; Ws)
This impressive hotel complex has 150 rooms in an unusually designed building near Peterhof's Upper Garden. Rooms are modern and sleek with all the amenities you'd expect, and the best have photogenic views of the Peter and Paul Church.
Shtandart RestaurantRUSSIAN$$
(Ресторан Штандарт GOOGLE MAP ; www.restaurantshtandart.spb.ru; Lower Park; mains R590-1300; h11am-8pm)
This large and upmarket restaurant overlooks the Gulf of Finland, just west of the boat dock, with plenty of seating both inside and out. It has a large and meaty menu full of filling but interesting Russian classics.
Grand OrangerieRUSSIAN$$
( GOOGLE MAP ; Lower Park; set menus R450-800; h11am-8pm)
This cafe in the orangery is a fine choice for lunch. It gets busy, though, so you may have to queue for a spot. It has a cafeteria-style counter where you can pick out your Russian classics; don't neglect the cake selection.
8Getting There & Away
It’s easy and cheap to reach Peterhof by bus or marshrutka. Marshrutka 300, 424 and 424A (R80) leave from outside the Avtovo metro station, while marshrutka 103 leaves from outside Leninsky Prospekt station. All pass through the town of Peterhof, immediately outside the palace. Tell the driver you want to go ‘vo dvaryéts’ (‘to the palace’) and you’ll be let off near the main entrance to the Upper Garden, on Sankt-Peterburgsky pr.
There’s also a reasonably frequent suburban train (R60, 40 minutes) from Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) to Novy Peterhof, from where you can walk (around 30 minutes), or take any bus except 357 to the fifth stop, which will take another 10 minutes.
From May to September, the Peterhof Express ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhof-express.com; single/return adult R800/1500, student R600/1000; h10am-6pm) hydrofoil departs from the jetty in front of the Admiralty every 30 minutes from 9am. It’s an expensive but highly enjoyable way to get to Peterhof, and you arrive right in front of the palace. The last hydrofoil leaves Peterhof at 7pm, and the trip takes 30 minutes.
OFF THE BEATEN TRACK
ORANIENBAUM ОРАНИЕНБАУМ

Oranienbaum (Orange Tree), the palace of Peter the Great's right-hand man Alexander Menshikov is 5km down the coast from Peterhof. The buildings are part of the Unesco World Heritage Site, and provide a fine window into Russia’s imperial past. The surrounding park (Музей-заповедник Ораниенбаум GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhofmuseum.ru; h9am-8pm) is worth a visit in its own right, with beautifully landscaped paths amid the lakes and greenery.
Menshikov’s impressive palace (Большой Меншиковский Дворец GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R400/250; h10.30am-6pm Wed-Mon) underwent a full restoration and reopened its state rooms in 2014. Most of the interiors are restorations of the 19th century ones, so reflect the taste of the various Romanovs who used the palace, rather than Menshikov himself, of whom there is no trace.
Among the other buildings in the park open to the public is the Chinese Palace (Китайский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun). Built for Catherine the Great as her private residence at Oranienbaum, this over-the-top rococo palace, designed by Antonio Rinaldi, is distinctly un-Chinese looking and, in fact, gets its name from its chinoiserie interiors, which feature painted ceilings and fine inlaid-wood floors and walls.
Opposite Oranienbaum's main entrance, Okhota (Охота GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovy pr 65a; mains R480-1220; hnoon-9pm Mon-Thu, to midnight Fri-Sun) serves up hearty fare in a traditional Russian environment. It's big on taxidermy for its hunting-themed decor.
Trains from St Petersburg’s Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) to Peterhof continues to Oranienbaum (R81, one hour). Get off at Lomonosov Station and walk diagonally across the little park in front, keep going up to the main road, turn right, pass the unmissable Archangel Michael Cathedral, and you’ll reach the park entrance on your left. Alternatively you can take marshrutky 300, 424 or 424A to Lomonosov (R70) from outside metro Avtovo. Get off at the Archangel Michael Cathedral and follow the park perimeter to the left until you reach the entrance.
Pushkin (Tsarskoe Selo) Пушкин (Царское Село)
%812 / POP 106,100
The grand imperial estate of Tsarskoe Selo in the town of Pushkin, 25km south of St Petersburg, is often combined on a day trip with the palace and sprawling park at Pavlovsk, 4km further south. It’s a great combination, but start out early as there’s lots to see: Pushkin can easily be a full-day trip in itself.
The railway that connects Pushkin and Pavlovsk with St Petersburg was Russia’s first, opened in 1837 to carry the imperial family between here and the then capital. The town changed its name to Pushkin in 1937 after Russia’s favourite poet, who studied here and whose school and dacha you can also visit. While the palace and park complex's name has reverted to Tsarskoe Selo (The Tsar's Village), the town remains proudly named for the national bard.

oCatherine PalacePALACE
(Екатерининский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tzar.ru; Sadovaya ul 7; adult/student R1000/350, audio guide R150; h10am-4.45pm Wed-Sun)
The centrepiece of Tsarskoe Selo, created under Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine the Great between 1744 and 1796, is the vast baroque Catherine Palace, designed by Rastrelli and named after Peter the Great’s second wife. The palace can only be visited by individuals between noon and 2pm, and 4pm and 4.45pm, otherwise it's reserved for pre-booked tour groups, such is its rightful popularity. The audio guide is well worth taking, as it gives detailed explanation of what you'll see in each room.
As at the Winter Palace, Catherine the Great had many of Rastrelli’s original interiors remodelled in classical style. Most of the gaudy exterior and 20-odd rooms of the palace have been beautifully restored – compare them to the photographs of the devastation left by the Germans.
The interiors are superb, with highlights including the Great Hall, the Arabesque Hall, the baroque Cavalier's Dining Room, the White State Dining Room, the Crimson and Green Pilaster Rooms, the Portrait Hall and, of course, the world-famous Amber Room. The panels used in the latter were a gift given to Peter the Great, but not put to any use until 1743 when Elizabeth decided to use them decoratively, after which they were ingeniously incorporated into the walls here. What you see is a reconstruction of the original that disappeared during WWII and is believed to have been destroyed.
oCatherine ParkPARK
(Екатерининский парк MAP GOOGLE MAP ; May-Sep R120, Oct-Apr free; h9am-6pm)
Around the Catherine Palace extends the lovely Catherine Park. The main entrance is on Sadovaya ul, next to the Palace Chapel ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ). The park extends around the ornamental Great Pond and contains an array of interesting buildings, follies and pavilions.
Near the Catherine Palace, the Cameron Gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h11am-6pm) normally has rotating exhibitions. Between the gallery and the palace, notice the south-pointing ramp that Cameron added for the ageing empress to walk down into the park.
The park’s outer section focuses on the Great Pond ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ). In summer you can take a ferry to the little island to visit the Chesme Column ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R250/150; h11am-6pm May-Sep). Beside the pond, the blue baroque Grotto Pavilion ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h10am-5pm Fri-Wed) houses temporary exhibitions in summer. A walk around the Great Pond will reveal other buildings that the royals built over the years, including the very incongruous-looking Turkish Bath ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; R200; h11am-6pm Thu-Tue Jun-Sep), with its minaret-style tower, the wonderful Marble Bridge, the Chinese Pavilion ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), and a Concert Hall ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; tickets R500) isolated on an island, where concerts take place every Saturday at 5pm.
oAlexander PalacePALACE
(Александровский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovaya ul 2)
The classical Alexander Palace, built by Quarenghi between 1792 and 1796 for the future Alexander I, is surrounded by the charming Alexander Park. Nicholas II, the last Russian tsar, was its main tenant and he made it his residence for much of his reign.
The palace is currently undergoing renovation and is closed to the public, with completion due in 2018 at the earliest.
THE MYSTERY OF THE AMBER ROOM

The original Amber Room was created from exquisitely engraved amber panels given to Peter the Great by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia in 1716. Rastrelli later combined the panels with gilded woodcarvings, mirrors, agate and jasper mosaics to decorate one of the rooms of the Catherine Palace. Plundered by the Nazis during WWII, the room’s decorative panels were last exhibited in Königsberg’s castle in 1941. Four years later, with the castle in ruins, the Amber Room was presumed destroyed. Or was it?
In 2004, as Putin and then German Chancellor Gerhardt Schröder presided over the opening of the new US$18 million Amber Room, restored largely with German funds, rumours about the original panels continued to swirl. There are those who believe that parts, if not all, of the original Amber Room remain hidden away (see www.amberroom.org). The mystery gained traction in February 2008 as attention focused on the possible contents of an artificial cavern discovered near the village of Deutschneudorf on Germany’s border with the Czech Republic. Nothing conclusive has yet been unearthed here, though, so the mystery continues.

8Getting There & Away
From Moskovskaya metro station, take the exit marked ‘Buses for the airport’, and then pick up marshrutka 286, 299, 342 or K545 towards Pushkin (R40). These buses all continue to Pavlovsk (R50). Look for Пушкин or Дворец on the buses.
Suburban trains run from Vitebsk Station (Vitebsky vokzal) in St Petersburg, but they’re infrequent except for weekends. For Pushkin, get off at Detskoe Selo (Детское село, R47, 30 minutes) and for Pavlovsk (R54, 40 minutes) at Pavlovsk Station (Павловск). From Detskoe Selo station, marshrutky (R25) frequently run the 500m or so to Tsarskoe Selo.
Pavlovsk Павловск
%812 / POP 16,200
Less visited than better known Pushkin to the east, Pavlovsk is nevertheless home to a stunning 18th-century royal palace and one of the finest green spaces in greater St Petersburg. It's well worth tacking on a visit here to explore the artfully designed interiors – and a small but first-rate collection of old-world masterpieces – followed by a stroll amid the verdure of Pavlovsk park.
Between 1781 and 1786, on orders from Catherine the Great, architect Charles Cameron designed the Great Palace in Pavlovsk. The palace was designated for Catherine’s son Paul (hence the name, Pavlovsk), and it was his second wife, Maria Fyodorovna, who orchestrated the design of the interiors. It served as a royal residence until 1917. Ironically, the original palace burnt down two weeks after WWII when a careless Soviet soldier’s cigarette set off German mines (the Soviets blamed the Germans). As at Tsarskoe Selo, its restoration is remarkable.

One of the most tragic and mysterious characters in the Romanov royal family, emperor Paul I was intensely disliked by his own courtiers, who eventually strangled him with a scarf. Whatever historians say about him, however, he had great taste, as displayed in this glorious palace, the finest rooms of which are on the middle floor of the central block.
Charles Cameron designed the round Italian Hall beneath the dome and the Grecian Hall to its west, though the lovely green fluted columns were added by his assistant Vincenzo Brenna. Flanking these are two private suites designed mainly by Brenna – Paul’s along the north side of the block and Maria Fyodorovna’s on the south.
The Hall of War of the military-obsessed Paul contrasts with Maria’s Hall of Peace, decorated with musical instruments and flowers. On the middle floor of the south block are Paul’s Throne Room and the Hall of the Maltese Knights of St John, of whom he was the Grand Master.
Pavlovsk ParkPARK
(Павловский парк GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R150/100; h6am-9pm Sat-Thu, closed 1st Mon of month)
You'll have to pay to enter the serene Pavlovsk Great Park just to access the palace, so it’s worth exploring while you're here. Filled with rivers and ponds, tree-lined avenues, classical statues and hidden temples, it’s a delightful place to get lost in. Highlights include the Rose Pavilion (Розовый павильон GOOGLE MAP ; Pavlovsk Park; adult/student R300/150; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun) and the Private Garden (Собственный садик GOOGLE MAP ; Pavlovsk Park; adult/child R250/150; h11am-7pm), with its beautifully arranged flowerbeds and impressive sculpture of the Three Graces.
Bike hire (R300 per hour) is available in several locations around the park and is a great way to explore, as distances are great.

8Getting There & Away
Trains and marshrutky running from St Petersburg to Pushkin continue to Pavlovsk. Marshrutky (R30) frequently shuttle between Pushkin and Pavlovsk; catch one from Pavolovskoe sh ( GOOGLE MAP ) near the southeast corner of Catherine Park, and get off either at Pavlovsk Station Bus Stop ( GOOGLE MAP ) (for entry to the park) or in front of Pavlovsk’s palace ( GOOGLE MAP ).
Gatchina Гатчина
%81371 / POP 93,000
Far less touristy than the other country palaces close to St Petersburg, Gatchina, 45km southwest of the city, can make for a very pleasant half-day trip. Gatchina is a busy and bustling town, which just happens to also host a tsarist palace and park.
1Sights
In the nearby town there are a couple of interesting churches. The baroque Pavlovsk Cathedral (Павловский собор GOOGLE MAP ; ul Sobornaya; h9am-7pm), at the end of the pedestrianised shopping street off the central pr 25 Oktyabrya, has a grandly restored interior with a soaring central dome. A short walk west is the Pokrovsky Cathedral (Покровский собор GOOGLE MAP ; Krasnaya ul; h9am-6pm), a red-brick building with bright blue domes.
Gatchina Great PalacePALACE
(Большой гатчинский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; www.gatchinapalace.ru/en; Krasnoarmeysky pr 1; adult/student R300/150, audio guide R200; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun, closed 1st Tue of month)
Shaped in a graceful curve around a central turret, the Gatchina Great Palace certainly lives up to its name – its enormous (if surprisingly plain) facade is quite a sight to behold, overlooking a vast parade ground and backing onto the huge landscaped grounds. Built by Rinaldi between 1766 and 1781 in an early classicism style for Catherine the Great’s favourite Grigory Orlov, the palace curiously combines motifs of a medieval fortress with elements commonly seen in Russian imperial residences.
It’s hard to call it beautiful, but there’s no doubt that it’s extremely impressive. After Orlov’s death in 1783, Catherine the Great bought the palace from his heirs and gifted it to her son Paul, who redesigned the exterior between 1792 and 1798.
Inside, the 10 state rooms on the 2nd floor are impressive, including Paul I’s throne room, hung with huge tapestries, and his wife Maria Fyodorovna’s throne room, the walls of which are covered in paintings. Most impressive of all is the White Hall, a Rinaldi creation from the 1770s that was redone by Brenna in the 1790s. On the balcony is an impressive collection of sundials.
Admission covers entry to the palace and all three pavillions in the grounds.
Gatchina ParkPARK
(Гатчинский парк GOOGLE MAP ; hdawn-dusk)F
Gatchina Park is more overgrown and romantic than the other palaces’ parklands. The park has many winding paths through birch groves and across bridges to islands in the large White Lake. Look out for the frankly bizarre Birch House (Березовый домик GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R50/20; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun May-Sep), which was a present from Maria Fyodorovna to Paul I. With a rough facade made of birch logs, the interior is actually very refined, with a beautiful hardwood floor made from timber from around the world.
5Eating
There is a cafe in the Grand Palace and a couple of simple cafes in the grounds, but as the place was made for picnicking, your best bet is to bring your own lunch. If you haven’t done so, however, there are a couple of decent options spread out along pedestrianised ul Sobornaya.
Kafe PiramidaRUSSIAN$
(Кафе Пирамида GOOGLE MAP ; ul Sobornaya 3a; mains R255-380; h10am-11pm)
Serving a wide range of traditional Russian dishes as well as pizza, plus delicious cakes and coffees, this cosy place is near the Pavlovsk Cathedral. It's poorly signposted, but is handily located just off pr 25 Oktyabrya.
ChasyRUSSIAN$$
(Часы GOOGLE MAP ; http://cafe-watch.ru; ul Sobornaya 7; mains R450-980; h10am-midnight)
Hands-down Gatchina's best eatery, Chasy is a friendly spot for grilled meats and seafood, and sushi. It's also a fine afternoon spot for a pot of tea and dessert. Look for the clock over the entrance (more timepieces lie within).
8Getting There & Away
The quickest way to get to Gatchina is by bus. Bus K18, K18A and 431 (R100, 45 minutes) run this route from outside Moskovskaya metro station and stop right by the park. Bus 100 (R100, one hour) also runs regularly from Moskovskaya; buses wait outside the massive House of Soviets and stop just short of Gatchina Park. Tell the driver you want to go to the palace (‘v dvaryéts’) – the bus turns off before you get to the park.
There are trains to Gatchina Baltiysky (R102, one hour) from St Petersburg's Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) every one to two hours. The train station is directly in front of the palace.
Kronshtadt Кронштадт
%812 / POP 43,000
With its grand cathedral, waterfront parks and pretty canal-lined avenues, Kronshtadt makes for a fascinating half-day visit. Aside from taking in one grand neo-Byzantine church and visiting a little-visited corner of greater St Petersburg, this is a fine place for seeing Russia’s mighty naval centre, and getting an overview of the bay on a boat tour.
Within a year of founding St Petersburg, Peter – desirous of protecting his new Baltic toehold – started work on the fortress of Kronshtadt on Kotlin Island, 29km out in the Gulf of Finland. It’s been a pivotal Soviet and Russian naval base ever since, and was closed to foreigners until 1996.
In 1921 the hungry and poor Red Army sailors stationed here organised an ill-fated mutiny against the Bolsheviks. They set up a Provisional Revolutionary Committee and drafted a resolution demanding, among other things, an end to Lenin’s harsh War Communism. On 16 March 1921 the mutineers were defeated when 50,000 troops crossed the ice from Petrograd and massacred nearly the entire naval force. The sailors’ stand wasn’t entirely in vain, as afterwards Lenin did scrap War Communism.
1Sights & Activities
Naval CathedralCHURCH
(Морской собор GOOGLE MAP ; Yakornaya pl; h9am-6.30pm)
Kronshtadt’s key sight is the unusual and beautiful Naval Cathedral. Built between 1903 and 1913 to honour Russian naval muscle, this neo-Byzantine wonder stands on Yakornaya pl (Anchor Sq), where you’ll also find an eternal flame for Kronshtadt’s sailors, and the florid art nouveau monument of Admiral Makarov.
The cathedral underwent a thorough renovation for its centennial celebrations and is now looking breathtaking, both inside and out. Its 75m-high cupola is the highest point in town, and its enormous interior makes its use as a cinema during the Soviet period rather logical.

One of Kronshtadt's better restaurants, the 'Big Turtle' serves up salads, spaghetti with seafood, perch fillet with vegetables, and grilled meats. With decent beers on tap, it's also a fine spot for an afternoon drink. It's located a short stroll from the Naval Cathedral – cross the main bridge and continue up Roshalya, where you'll see it on the right.
8Getting There & Away
Catch bus 101 to Kronshtadt from Staraya Derevnya metro station (R40, 40 minutes). Upon exiting the metro, turn hard left and then walk past the marshrutky and trams until you come to a second bus park where the 101 bus begins and ends its route. Alternatively take marshrutka 405 from Chyornaya Rechka station (R80, 40 minutes); exit the station to your left and cross the street to find the stop.
Vehicles heading back to St Petersburg depart from both sides of the large ‘Dom Byta’ on the corner of ul Grazhdanskaya and pr Lenina. From there it’s about a 1km walk southeast to the Naval Cathedral.
With the completion of St Petersburg's ring road, it's now possible to reach Kronshtadt from Oranienbaum, meaning it's perfectly feasible to combine a trip here with a visit to one of the Tsarist palaces.
WORTH A TRIP
REPINO РЕПИНО

Come summer, Petersburgers stream out of the city to relax on the beaches to the north between Sestroretsk and Zelenogorsk on the Gulf of Finland. Between these two towns you’ll find the village of Repino, 45km from St Petersburg. From 1918 to the end of WWII, this area was part of Finland and the village was known as Kuokkala. In 1948, back in Russian hands, the village was renamed in honour of its most famous resident, Ilya Repin.
Penaty (Пенаты GOOGLE MAP ; %812-432 0828; www.nimrah.ru; Primorskoe Shosse 411; adult/student R300/200; hmuseum 10.30am-6pm Wed-Sun, grounds 10.30am-8pm Wed-Mon), the artist's home in his later years, is preserved as a museum. Repin bought land here in 1899, named the estate after a Roman household god and designed the light-flooded house in an arts-and-crafts style. Several of Repin's paintings still hang on the walls and the furnishings have been left just as they were during his residence, which was up to his death in 1930. His grave, marked by a simple Russian Orthodox wooden cross, is in the surrounding park, along with a couple of wooden follies also designed by Repin.
While here also visit the nearby Beach Laskovy (Пляж Ласковый GOOGLE MAP ) and stop for a meal at either Skazka ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-432 1251; www.skazkarepino.ru; Primorskoe Shosse 415; mains R570-1490; h11am-11pm; W), which has an attractive dining room with big picture windows and a terrace – both fine spots for enjoying its nicely executed dishes– or Penaty (Пенаты GOOGLE MAP ; %812-432 1125; Primorskoe Shosse 411A; mains R400-850; h10am-10pm), which serves a good range of Russian dishes and offers a pleasant flower-trimmed terrace.
The easiest way to get to Repino is to take the frequent marshrutky 400 (R105, one hour) that leave from near Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal) – cross ul Komsomola, and look for the stop on the right side of pl Lenina. You can also catch bus 211 (R90, one hour) from beside Chyornya Rechka metro station. Be sure to tell the driver that you want to get out at Penaty.
Leningrad Region Ленинградская область
If you have more time, there are several other places in the Leningrad region that can be seen in a day trip or longer from St Petersburg. These including the charming old Finnish town of Vyborg, the sleepy village of Staraya Ladoga and the monastery town of Tikhvin.
Vyborg
%81378 / POP 78,500 / TIME MOSCOW
This appealing Gulf of Finland provincial town is dominated by a medieval castle and peppered with beautiful Finnish art-nouveau buildings and romantic cobblestone streets. An important port and rail junction, Vyborg is 174km northwest of St Petersburg and just 30km from the Finnish border. It has just about enough to do to justify staying over, but is also an easy day trip from St Petersburg.
The border has jumped back and forth around Vyborg for most of its history. Peter the Great captured it from the Swedes in 1710. A century later it fell within autonomous Finland, and after the revolution Vyborg remained part of independent Finland. Since then the Finns have called it Viipuri. Stalin took Vyborg in 1939, lost it to the Finns during WWII, and on getting it back at the end of the war deported all the Finns. Today the Finns are back by the coachloads for sightseeing and carousing on the weekends.
1Sights
With the exception of Park Monrepo, all Vyborg’s main sights are neatly arranged around a compact peninsula, making it an ideal town to explore on foot.
Apart from the castle, other relics of Vyborg’s Swedish times are found in the squat Round Tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Rynochnaya), which now houses a restaurant; the remains of the 15th-century Town Hall (Башня Ратуши MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Vyborgskaya 15), with its distinctive white tower crowned with what resembles a giant metallic wizard’s hat; and the Clock Tower (Часовая башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Krepostnaya 5), dating to 1490.

Rising stoutly from an islet in Vyborg Bay, this castle was built by the Swedes in 1293 when they first captured Karelia from Novgorod. Most of it now consists of 16th-century alterations. The castle contains several exhibition halls, including a mildly diverting small museum ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; R100; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun) on local history, but the main attraction is climbing the many steps of whitewashed St Olaf’s Tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) for commanding views over the town (closed for renovations at time of research).
oHermitage VyborgMUSEUM

Housed in a wing of a striking building designed by Finnish architect Uno Ulberg in 1930, this small museum hosts themed exhibitions that are curated from the Hermitage’s massive collection and change every six months. The functional white building, which sits in the middle of an old defensive bastion, is shared with Vyborg’s arts school, which also has a gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Ladanova 1; h10am-6pm Mon-Fri) with regularly changing exhibitions.

A must-see for architecture fans is the beautifully designed public library, one of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto's iconic designs. After years of restoration, the 1935 building looks lovelier than ever, with painstaking efforts to return it to Aalto's original vision. Handmade bronze-handled doors, circular skylights in the reading room, and elegant birchwood shelves are among the many features. It's still a working public library, open to all (though oddly, it lacks wi-fi).

Services to/from St Petersburg (R280, to/from either metro stations Devyatkino or Parnas) run every 20 minutes from 6.30am to 8pm. Theoretically, travel time is around 2¼ hours, but the traffic can lengthen this, so the train remains the best option.
TRAIN
Elektrichki (R301, 2½ hours, hourly) leave from St Petersburg’s Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal). Of these, there are also a handful of express services (R331, 1¼ hours, four daily), or the far more expensive Helsinki-bound trains, which stop in Vyborg (R2236, one hour).
Staraya Ladoga
%81363 / POP 3200 / TIME MOSCOW
Although you’d hardly guess it now, this tranquil village, 125km east of St Petersburg on the winding banks of the Volkhov River, lays claim to being Russia’s first capital. The idea of this place being a 'capital' of anywhere is quite extraordinary, though, and today you’ll find an ancient fortress, several churches and some prettily painted wooden cottages. It makes for a pleasant escape from St Petersburg, particularly in summer, when a swim in the river adds to the charm.
The town was known simply as Ladoga until 1704, when Peter the Great founded Novaya (New) Ladoga to the north as a transfer point for the materials arriving to build St Petersburg. Protected as a national reserve, the town’s basic layout has remained virtually unchanged since the 12th century, give or take a few ugly Soviet blocks.
RUSSIA’S ANCIENT CAPITAL

Just as the origins of Rus are continually debated, so is Staraya Ladoga’s status as ‘Russia’s first capital’. Nevertheless, its age (historians have given 753 as the village’s birth date) and significance remain uncontested.
When the Scandinavian Viking Rurik, along with his relatives Truvor and Sineus, swept into ancient Russia in 862, he built a wooden fortress on the Volkhov River and made this his base. Rurik is depicted in a colourful mosaic on the side of the village school. Locals also claim that one of the tumuli (Урочище Сопки) at the north end of the village is the grave of Oleg, Rurik’s successor.
Archaeological expeditions continue to uncover a wealth of information about the town’s past. In 1997 a second 9th-century fortress was discovered 2km outside the village. Evidence of Byzantine influences in the frescoes of the village’s 12th-century churches point to the town as a cultural as well as historical and commercial crossroads.
1Sights
Everything of interest lies along the main road that runs parallel to the river.
Staraya Ladoga FortressHISTORIC SITE
(Староладожская крепость GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R150/free; h9am-5pm Mon-Fri, to 6pm Sat & Sun)
Towards the southern end of the village, and with an excellent view along the river, the 7m-thick walls and stout towers of this fortress are slowly being rebuilt. Inside the grounds you’ll find the small stone St George’s Church (Георгиевская Церковь GOOGLE MAP ; 9am-6pm; hMay-Oct), only open May to October in order to protect the remains of the delicate 12th-century frescoes still visible on its walls, and the cute wooden Church of Dimitry Solun.
The Vorotnaya Tower houses the good Historical-Architectural & Archaeological Museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; h9am-5pm Mon-Fri, to 6pm Sat & Sun), which displays an interesting retrospective of the area’s history, including a scale model of how the fortress once looked and items found on archaeological digs, with English explanations.
Visiting this soulful old place and wandering around its crumbling ramparts is a unique experience and you might feel you're in a Tarkovsky film.
Svyato-Uspensky Devichy MonasteryMONASTERY
(Свято-Успенский девичий монастырь GOOGLE MAP ; Volkhovsky pr; h9am-6pm)
The women's monastery on the main road in Staraya Ladoga is a remarkably atmospheric place to wander. The small brick church, with its 900-year-old frescoes, is only open on weekends during summer; at other times you can visit the grounds.
Nikolsky MonasteryMONASTERY
(Никольский монастырь GOOGLE MAP ; www.en.nikmonas.ru; h9am-6pm)
This attractive walled complex dates to the 12th century and is still in the process of being rebuilt following its decommissioning during the Soviet years. The main church and bell tower now look quite handsome. Nearby is a pontoon from which you can swim in the river.
The monastery is located about 1km south of Staraya Ladoga Fortress.

The best overnight option in Staraya Ladoga is this modest grey-brick hotel, tucked down a lane north of the Svyato-Uspensky Devichy Monastery. Although it looks unpromising from the outside, the rooms are fairly well maintained with sizeable windows overlooking the surrounding greenery.

8Getting There & Away
Elektrichki to Volkhov (the Volkhovstroy I station) depart from both St Petersburg’s Moskovsky and Ladozhsky stations (R300, 2½ hours, 20 daily). From Volkhov, bus 23 (R48, 30 minutes, hourly) departs from the main bus stop outside the station towards Novaya Ladoga, passing through Staraya Ladoga. Get off when you see the fortress. A taxi from Volkhov costs R320.
Buses to and from Tikhvin also pass near the Yuzhkovo turn-off to the village, so you can combine a visit to both destinations. When you get off at Yuzhkovo, take a taxi (there are usually a couple hanging around to meet buses) to Staraya Ladoga (R250). It's also just as easy to take a train from Tikhvin to Volkhov.
Tikhvin Тихвин
%81367 / POP 57,900 / TIME MOSCOW
The highlight of this small, quiet town on the banks of the Tikhvinka River is a beautiful monastery established in 1560 by decree of Ivan the Terrible. There’s been a community here since the 14th century, and for thousands of years before that the area formed part of the hereditary lands of the Finnic Veps (also known as Vepsians). Tikhvin is also the birthplace of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, whose music was inspired by the local nature, folk tunes and religious ringing of bells.

Tikhvin Monastery of the Mother of GodMONASTERY
(Тихвинский Богородичный Успенский Мужской Монастырь GOOGLE MAP ; www.tihvinskii-monastyr.ru; ul Tikhvinskaya 1; h8am-8pm)
Rising like a fairy tale across the Tabory pond, this complex is about a 1km walk from the train station straight along Sovetskaya ul. At its heart is the onion-domed Assumption Cathedral, established in 1510, and painted inside, and partially outside, with detailed frescoes. A famous icon of Mary and Jesus said to have been painted by the apostle Luke draws awed pilgrims from across Russia, particularly on 9 July, when a procession celebrates the return of the icon to Tikhvin.
The complex’s nunnery, crowned by a five-spired belfry, is where Ivan the Terrible sent his fourth wife to be confined. Within the walls you’ll also find several museums, including the Tikhvin Historical Memorial & Architectural Museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; ul Tikhvinskaya 1; adult/child R120/free; h9am-5pm Tue-Sun), which has interesting displays on the monastery’s history and examples of its religious art dating back to the 16th century.

(Государственный Дом-музей Римского-Корсакова GOOGLE MAP ; %81369-51 509; ul Rimskogo-Korsakova 12; adult/child R110/free; h10am-5pm Tue-Sun)
This early-19th-century wooden house was the composer’s childhood home until the age of 12. It became a museum in 1944, the centenary of Rimsky-Korsakov’s birth, and the rooms have been reconstructed to look as they would have done when his family was living there. The charming guides will point out all the original features, including a Becker grand piano on which concerts are sometimes given (call for details).
There’s a stone bust of the composer on a plinth in the small park next to the house. Opposite is the tiny Church of All Saints Polkovaya (Церковь Всех Святых “Полковая”), which also sometimes hosts concerts.

IstoriyaRUSSIAN$$
(История GOOGLE MAP ; ul Sovetskaya 62; Mains R460-840; hnoon-midnight)
Restaurant 'History' boasts country charm on the inside, with heavy wooden tables and chairs and old photos of Tikhvin on the walls. The cooking is decent, with Russian classics like pelmeni and borscht, plus grilled fish and pastas made in-house.
It's located just before the turnoff to the monastery.
8Getting There & Away
The town is on the rail route to Vologda and Arkhangelsk, so you could break your journey to or from either of those destinations here.
Tikhvin’s bus and train stations are opposite each other on Vokzalny per. Trains here leave from St Petersburg’s Ladozhsky vokzal (platskart/kupe R670/1150, three to four hours, six daily). Bus 860 goes four times a day from St Petersburg's bus station to Tikhvin (R400, 4½ hours). The last departure from Tikhvin back to St Petersburg is around 5pm.
To travel to Staraya Ladoga, there is no direct service. By train you can travel from Tikhvin to Volkhov (1½ to two hours, from R550, eight daily), and hop on an onward bus (R48, 30 minutes) or taxi (R330) into town.

Kremlin
1This ancient fortress is the founding site of Moscow and the ultimate symbol of political power in Russia. Within its ancient walls you can admire the artistry of Russia’s greatest icon painters, shed a tear for Russia’s great and tragic rulers, peer down the barrel of the gargantuan Tsar Cannon and gawk at the treasure trove that fuelled a revolution. On your way out, admire the bouquets left by newlyweds and scrutinise the perfect synchronicity of the guards at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.

Red Square
2Stepping onto Red Square never ceases to inspire, with the tall towers and imposing walls of the Kremlin, the playful jumble of patterns and colours adorning St Basil’s Cathedral, the majestic red bricks of the State History Museum and the elaborate edifice of GUM, all encircling a vast stretch of cobblestones. Individually they are impressive, but all together, the ensemble is electrifying. Red Square should be among your first stops in Moscow. Return at night to see the square empty of crowds and the buildings awash in lights.

Ballet at the Bolshoi
3An evening at the Bolshoi Theatre is the ultimate 'special occasion' in the capital. Ever since its opening in 1856, the neoclassical theatre has offered a magical setting for a spectacle, whether ballet or opera. The main stage still sparkles brightly, with the theatre space draped in rich red velour and glittering with gilded mouldings, but it has also been updated with the latest technologies. The historic theatre is the premier place to see the Bolshoi Ballet – one of the leading ballet companies in the country (and the world).

Gorky Park
4Back in the day, Gorky Park was famous as a setting for a spy novel, but nowadays it is Moscow's hippest, most happening hotspot. From morning (when runners ply the riverside path) to night (when dancers move to sultry music), the hipsters have taken over. In fact, the whole length of the Krymskaya nab – from Red October to Vorobyovy Gory – has been redesigned into a chain of sparkling fountains, sport courts, outdoor art exhibits and summer cafes. From May to September, there's no better place to be.

Factories Turned Art Centres
5Nothing exemplifies postindustrial cool like the art complexes and design centres that have proliferated in the capital's former factories and warehouses. The place that started the trend is Winzavod, a former wine-bottling factory that now houses cutting-edge art galleries. Since that initial success, many other factories have followed suit. Flakon was a crystal production plant, but now it's a centre for design and architecture. A former bread factory, Khlebozavod 9 bustles with boutiques and trendy cafes. And the list goes on. This is contemporary, creative Moscow at its best.

Moscow Metro
6The Moscow metro is at once a history lesson and an art museum (not to mention a pretty efficient form of transportation). Construction started in the 1930s and it continues today. The design of the stations and the direction of the expansion tell a story about Moscow in the 20th and 21st centuries. Even more intriguing is the amazing artwork and architectural design that characterises the stations, many of which are constructed from granite and marble, and are adorned with mosaics, bas-reliefs and other detailing.

Tretyakov Gallery
7The memorable Russian-Revival building on Lavrushinsky per is Moscow’s largest art museum and the world's premier collection of Russian art, covering the span of Russian art history from ancient icons to avant-garde. (Indeed, the Tretyakov’s second building on Krymsky val continues further into the 20th century with supremetism, constructivism and, of course, socialist realism.) The Tretyakov is famed for its impressive collection of wonderful realist paintings by the Peredvizhniki, but the museum also contains show-stopping examples of Russian Revival and art nouveau works.

Banya at Sanduny Baths
8What better way to cope with big-city stress than to have it steamed, sweated, washed and beaten out of you? The banya is a uniquely Russian experience that will leave you feeling clean, refreshed and relaxed. In winter, the tension of constant cold is released by the hot, steamy bath, while a beating with birch branches helps to improve circulation. But even in warmer temperatures, the Russian bathhouse experience is refreshing and reinvigorating. Sanduny is Moscow’s oldest bathhouse – a luxurious setting in which to indulge in this national pastime.

Russian Cuisine
10Moscow may not be an obvious choice for culinary travel ('eat up your beets!'). But nowadays, the capital delights visitors with opportunities to sample a rich, diverse and delectable cuisine that's truly come into its own. The temptations are many: old-fashioned haute-russe delicacies enjoyed by oligarchs of old; satisfying retro dishes at nostalgic Soviet-themed restaurants; and many fresh, modern approaches by innovative chefs emphasising local ingredients. Moscow is also a prime spot to sample the tantalising fare from Central Asia and the Caucasus. Priatnogo appetita!

1Tour of the Metro

Every day, as many as seven million people ride the Moscow metro. What’s more, this transport system marries function and form: many of the stations are marble-faced, frescoed, gilded works of art. Take this tour for an overview of Moscow's most interesting and impressive metro stations.


Komsomolskaya station | akedesign/shutterstock ©
Komsomolskaya
At Komsomolskaya, the red line 1 (Sokolnicheskaya liniya) intersects with line 5, also known as the Ring line (Koltsevaya liniya). Both stations are named for the youth workers who helped with early construction. In the line 1 station, look for the Komsomol emblem at the top of the limestone pillars and the majolica-tile panel showing the volunteers hard at work. The Ring-line station has a huge stuccoed hall, the ceiling featuring mosaics of past Russian military heroes.
From Komsomolskaya, proceed anti-clockwise around the Ring line, getting off at each stop along the way.
Prospekt Mira
Originally named for the nearby MGU Botanical Garden, Prospekt Mira features elegant, white-porcelain depictions of figures planting trees, bringing in the harvest and generally living in harmony.
Novoslobodskaya
Thirty-two stained-glass panels envelop this station in art nouveau artistry. Six windows depict the so-called intellectual professions: architect, geographer, agronomist, engineer, artist and musician. At one end of the central hall is the mosaic Peace in the Whole World. The pair of white doves was a later addition to the mosaic, replacing a portrait of Stalin.
Belorusskaya
The ceiling mosaics celebrate the culture, economy and history of Russia’s neighbour to the west. The 12 ceiling panels illustrate different aspects of their culture, while the floor pattern reproduces traditional Belarusian ornamentation.
Switch here to line 2 (the green Zamoskvoretskaya line), where the Belarusian theme continues, and travel south.
Mayakovskaya
This is the pièce de résistance of the Moscow metro. The grand-prize winner at the 1938 World’s Fair in New York has an art deco central hall that’s all pink rhodonite, with slender, steel columns. The inspiring, upward-looking mosaics on the ceiling depict 24 Hours in the Land of the Soviets. This is also one of the deepest stations (33m), which allowed it to serve as an air-raid shelter during WWII.

Mayakovskaya station; art deco masterpiece of the Metro | andrey kryuchenko/500px ©
Teatralnaya
This station was formerly called Ploshchad Sverdlova in honour of Lenin’s right-hand man (whose bust was in the hall). Nonetheless, the station’s decor follows a theatrical theme. The porcelain figures represent seven of the Soviet republics by wearing national dress and playing musical instruments from their homeland.
Change here to Ploshchad Revolyutsii station on line 3 (the dark blue Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line).

Kievskaya station | piith hant/shutterstock ©
Ploshchad Revolyutsii
This dramatic station is basically an underground sculpture gallery. The life-sized bronze statues represent the roles played by the people during the revolution and in the 'new world' that comes after. Heading up the escalators, the themes are: revolution, industry, agriculture, hunting, education, sport and child rearing. Touch the nose of the border guard’s dog for good luck on exams.
Take line three heading west.
Arbatskaya
This shallow station was damaged by a German bomb in 1941. The station was closed (supposedly permanently) and a parallel line was built much deeper. Service was restored on this shallow line the following decade, which explains the existence of two Arbatskaya stations (and two Smolenskaya stations, for that matter) on two different lines.
At 250m, Arbatskaya is one of the longest stations. A braided moulding emphasises the arched ceiling, while red marble and detailed ornamentation give the whole station a baroque atmosphere.
Kievskaya
This elegant white-marble hall is adorned with a Kyivan-style ornamental frieze, while the frescoed panels depict farmers in folk costume, giant vegetables and other aspects of the idyllic Ukrainian existence. The fresco at the end of the hall celebrates 300 years of Russian-Ukrainian cooperation. Ironic.
HISTORY OF THE MOSCOW METRO

When Stalin announced plans for Metrostroy (construction of the metro) in the 1930s, loyal communists turned out in droves to lend a hand. Thousands of people toiled around the clock in dire conditions, using pickaxes and spades and hand-pulled trolleys. Some 10,000 members of the Moscow Komsomol (Soviet youth league) contributed their time to building the communist dream.
The first metro line opened on 16 May 1935 at 7am. Thousands of people spent the night at the doors of the station so they might ride the first train on the red line (between Park Kultury in the south and Sokolniki in the north). Two additional lines opened in 1938.
Construction continued during the Great Patriotic War, with the opening of two additional lines. Several stations actually served as air-raid shelters during the Siege of Moscow in 1941. The Ring line (Koltsevaya line) opened in the early 1950s.
Khrushchev’s tastes were not as extravagant as Stalin’s, so later stations employ a uniform, utilitarian design. But the metro continued to expand, and still continues today (as does Moscow itself).
Park Pobedy
This newer station opened after the complex at Poklonnaya Gora, which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the victory in the Great Patriotic War. It is the deepest Moscow metro station, and it has the longest escalators in the world. The enamel panels at either end of the hall (created by Zurab Tsereteli) depict the victories of 1812 and 1945.
From here you can return to the centre by retracing your ride on line three.

ATime The Moscow metro runs every day from 5.30am until 1am. The metro can be uncomfortably crowded at peak times, so the best time to take a tour is Saturday or Sunday morning or any evening after 8pm.
APrice One ride costs R55, which is sufficient to tour the stations as long as you don't exit the metro. If you intend to use the metro for transportation during your stay in Moscow, you can purchase a card with multiple rides at discounted rates (eg 20 rides for R720).






5Eating

In recent years Moscow has blossomed into a culinary capital. Foodies will be thrilled by the dining options, from old-fashioned haute-russe to contemporary 'author cuisine'. The ban on imported foodstuffs means that chefs are finding innovative ways to utilise local ingredients, rediscovering ancient cooking techniques and inventing new ones in the process. And Moscow diners are eating it up. Literally.

Local Specialities
Russian cuisine is strongly influenced by climate and class. Long winters and short growing seasons mean the cuisine is dependent on root vegetables such as potatoes and beets. Fresh produce has always been a rarity, so vegetables are often served pickled; fruit is frequently served in the form of compote. According to an old Russian proverb, 'shchi (cabbage soup) and kasha (porridge) is our nourishment'. This saying emphasises the important role played by soups and grains in sustaining generations of peasants through cold, dark winters.
BREAKFAST
Russians rarely skip breakfast, or zavtrak. Russian cuisine includes half a dozen kinds of kasha, or porridge, including buckwheat, millet, oat and semolina. Bliny are thin, crepe-like pancakes with sweet or savoury fillings. At the very least, you'll get bread (khleb) with butter and jam, alongside your tea.
APPETISERS & SALADS
Whether as the preamble to a meal, or something to snack on between vodka shots, zakuski (appetisers) are an important part of Russian cuisine. Back in the day, a good host always had a spread of zakuski on the table to welcome unexpected guests.
Most famously, ikra (caviar) is the snack of tsars and New Russians. The best caviar is black caviar, from osetra or beluga sturgeon. However, due to overfishing, sturgeon populations have declined drastically in recent years, driving up prices and threatening the fish with extinction. The much cheaper and saltier option is red salmon caviar. Russians spread it on buttered bread and wash it down with a slug of vodka or a toast of champagne.
Most traditional menus offer a multitude of salads, many with names that will leave you scratching your head. The universal favourite is salat olivye (Olivier salad), which is chopped chicken or ham, mixed with potatoes, eggs, peas and mayonnaise. Another classic is seld pod shuby, or 'herring in a fur coat' – a colourful conglomeration of herring, beets and potatoes.
SOUPS
Soups are perhaps the pinnacle of Russian cooking, with both hot and cold varieties turning up on menus and in local kitchens. The most famous is borsch, or beetroot soup, but other favourites include solyanka, a meat broth with salty vegetables and a hint of lemon, and okroshka, a cold soup made from kvas (fermented rye-bread water).
Soups are served as the first course of a Russian meal. As such, they often appear on the menu under the heading Pervaya, or 'first'.
MAIN COURSES
Traditional Russian main courses are usually heavy, meat-based dishes. Fried cutlets (kotlet) and grilled kebabs (shashlyk) are popular preparations that often show up on the menu, listed under Glavnaya (main) or Vtoraya (second). Especially satisfying in winter, look for zharkoye (hot pot), an appropriately named meat stew served piping hot in a single-serving ceramic pot.
Pelmeni (dumplings) are the ultimate Russian comfort food. Traditionally from Siberia but now served everywhere, these bite-size dumplings are usually stuffed with pork or beef, then topped with sour cream. Variations such as salmon or mushroom pelmeni are also on the menus of modern Moscow restaurants.
Moscow Trends
FOREIGN CUISINES
A decade ago, Moscow was mad for sushi. You’ll still see it on many menus, but the raw-fish craze is finally starting to tap out. What is not going anywhere is the more general interest in international flavours. When you tire of beetroot soup and beef stroganoff, you’ll be able to find excellent French, Italian and American restaurants, not to mention Chinese, Lebanese, Thai, Turkish and more.
Also popular – and perhaps more interesting for visitors to Moscow – are the rich cuisines from former Soviet republics of Central Asia and the Caucasus. The capital is littered with restaurants representing the best of Armenian, Azeri, Georgian and Uzbek cuisines – usually with natives manning the kitchen.
CREATIVE CUISINE
Nowadays, the most exciting trend in Moscow cuisine is the emergence of avtorskaya kukhnya, or 'author cuisine'. As the name implies, young chefs are creating their own brands of cooking, incorporating the best of local and international elements. Seasonal menus highlight local ingredients – a trend that has become more urgent and more creative since the sanctions have been levied on imported food products. Still, cooking techniques, food preparations and flavours are adapted from all over the world, resulting in menus that are innovative, unique – and delightfully delicious.
This fresh take on cooking is on full display at the annual Omnivore Festival (www.omnivoremoscow.ru), which is held over several days in March or April, with master classes, taste testing, eating and drinking, culminating with a giant dinner party.
VEGETARIANS
The culinary revolution has opened up some new options for vegetarians and vegans. Most restaurants now offer at least one vegetarian choice. Additionally, there is no shortage of Indian and Italian restaurants offering meat-free options. During the 40 days before Orthodox Easter (Пасха in Russian), many restaurants offer a Lenten menu that is happily animal-free.

Georgian Cuisine

In her book The Georgian Feast, writer Darra Goldstein describes the former Soviet republic of Georgia as 'a land blessed by Heaven's table scraps'. Short of Heaven itself, Moscow is the best place outside the Caucasus to sample this rich, spicy cuisine.
The fertile region – wedged between East and West – has long been the beneficiary and victim of merchants and raiders passing through. These influences are evident in Georgian cooking, which shows glimpses of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern flavours. But the truly Georgian elements – the differences – are what make this cuisine so delectable. Most meat and vegetable dishes use ground walnuts or walnut oil as an integral ingredient, yielding a distinctive, nutty flavour. Also characteristic of Georgian cuisine is the spice mixture khmeli-suneli, which combines coriander, garlic, chillies and pepper with a saffron substitute made from dried marigold petals.
Georgian chefs love to prepare food over an open flame, and grilled meats are among the tastiest items on any Georgian menu. Herbs such as coriander, dill and parsley are often served fresh, with no preparation or sauce, as a palate-cleansing counterpoint to rich dishes. Grapes and pomegranates show up not only as desserts, but also as tart complements to roasted meats.
The most beloved item on the Georgian menu is undoubtedly khachapuri, a rich, cheesy bread that is made with circles of fresh dough cooked with sour, salty suluguni cheese. Sometimes it is topped with a raw egg in the crater.
Around Moscow, there are scores of Georgian restaurants in all price ranges. Sample this delicious food now: you may not have another chance until you get to Tbilisi.

Neighbourhoods at a Glance


1Kremlin & Kitay Gorod
Red Square and the Kremlin are the historical, geographic and spiritual heart of Moscow, as they have been for nearly 900 years. The mighty fortress, the iconic onion domes of St Basil’s Cathedral and the granite mausoleum of Vladimir Ilych Lenin are among the city’s most important historical sights. The surrounding streets of Kitay Gorod are crammed with churches and old architecture. This is the starting point for any visit to Moscow.
2Tverskoy
Tverskoy is Moscow's busiest, swankiest and most commercialised district. Few people can afford to live here, but millions pour in daily to work, hunt for garments at shopping arcades or dine out. It is also home to 20-plus theatres and concert halls, including the world-famous Bolshoi Theatre, several renowned galleries and – last but not least – the opulent Sanduny Baths. Beyond the Garden Ring, Tverskoy blends into the more relaxed Novoslobodsky district, home of the Jewish Museum and a cluster of bustling bars and restaurants around Mendeleyevskaya metro station.
3Presnya
The vast, diverse Presnya district spans the centuries, with a remarkable blend of building styles from the last three. The district’s ample attractions include its impressive and varied architecture, several noteworthy literary sites, and more traditional venues such as the zoo and planetarium. Presnya is also home to many of Moscow’s top restaurants, including the highly lauded Cafe Pushkin. The former textile factory at Tryokhgornaya is fast becoming a centre for nightlife and dining.
4Arbat & Khamovniki
The side-by-side districts of Arbat and Khamovniki are rich with culture. Moscow’s most famous street, ul Arbat, is something of an art market, complete with portrait painters and soapbox poets, while the nearby streets are lined with museums and galleries, including the world-class Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts. Khamovniki is home to the ancient Novodevichy Convent and Cemetery, as well as several unique newer museums. Further out, it's worth a trip to the south side of the Moscow River for certain key destinations, such as triumphant Park Pobedy.
5Zamoskvorechie
With its low-rise buildings, quaint courtyards and multitude of onion domes, Zamoskvorechie is like a provincial Russian town that somehow ended up in central Moscow. The people responsible for the lingering old-world ambience are kuptsy (merchants) who populated the area until the 19th century and had completely different lifestyles and habits to the nobility living across the river. But modernity is very much present thanks to the ever-expanding gentrification belt that stretches along the river, showcasing beautifully renovated parks, art spaces and hipster clusters filled with restaurants and bars.
6Meshchansky & Basmanny
Covering a large swathe of central Moscow, Meshchansky is markedly laid-back compared with its neighbouring districts. Here you'll find fewer offices, dominated as it is by prerevolutionary residential buildings. Beyond the Garden Ring, Basmanny is an area of 19th-century red-brick factories, now taken over by innovative postmodern galleries, cool cafes and digital startups. South of the Yauza, Taganskaya pl is a monster intersection that can be difficult to navigate, but the area is home to a few unusual sights, including Bunker-42 and the Museum of the Russian Icon.







Kremlin & Kitay Gorod


Neighbourhood Top Five
1Kremlin Wandering around the grounds and exploring 500 years of artistic mastery, political power and spiritual devotion; and gawking at the royal treasures in the Armoury.
2St Basil’s Cathedral Marvelling at the multicoloured, multidomed spectacle that is the icon of Russia.
3Lenin’s Mausoleum Paying your respects to embalmed Vladimir Ilych and other communist heavy hitters.
4Kitay Gorod Discovering the ancient churches hidden among the narrow streets of this 13th-century neighbourhood.
5Alexander Garden Visiting the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and catching the changing of the guard.
Explore Kremlin & Kitay Gorod
If you have only one day in Moscow, you will probably spend it here. With more time, you might spend more than a day here, exploring the churches and museums, and viewing the trappings of power.
The neighbourhood’s key attractions are clustered around Red Square and within the walls of the Kremlin. It doesn’t matter which of these two you take in first, but try to leave time for both. Your visit to the Kremlin should be planned around admission to the Armoury: it requires advance purchase of tickets, which specify the admission times.
Besides being a major tourist attraction, Red Square hosts concerts, festivals, parades and other official events. As a result, the place is sometimes closed to the public and it's almost always packed with people. Come early in the morning or late in the evening to catch a glimpse of the square when it is sparsely populated, vast and majestic.
Travellers with some extra time will enjoy wandering the medieval streets of Kitay Gorod, discovering ancient hidden churches and popping into shops and cafes. It is a welcome change from the hustle and bustle that characterises the Kremlin and Red Square.
Local Life
AParks Muscovites don’t often hang out on Red Square, but they do enjoy Alexander Garden, where they stroll among the flower beds, snap photos and (gasp) lounge on the grass.
AWedding Parties The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is Moscow’s top destination for wedding parties, who snap photos and drink champagne while the bride and groom pay their respects by laying flowers on the grave site.
AShopping Malls It may be too expensive for most Muscovites to shop at the stores in GUM, but it's affordable to eat at the mall's Stolovaya No 57 – as evidenced by the lines of locals out the door at lunchtime.
Getting There & Away
ARed Square Three metro lines converge at Red Square. Okhotny Ryad station is on line 1 (red); Teatralnaya station is on line 2 (dark green); and Ploshchad Revolyutsii is on line 3 (dark blue).
AKitay Gorod Lines 6 and 7 (orange and purple) intersect in Kitay Gorod, with both stations sharing the name of the neighbourhood. Line 1 (red) has an eponymous station at Lubyanka, which is also useful for Kitay Gorod.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
If you think Red Square is impressive by day, come back at night, when the crowds are gone and the lights cast a magical glow on the historic buildings.

TOP SIGHT
THE KREMLIN
The apex of Russian political power and once the centre of the Orthodox Church, the Kremlin is not only the kernel of Moscow but of the whole country. From here, autocratic tsars, communist dictators and modern-day presidents have done their best – and worst – for Russia. These red-brick walls and tent-roof towers enclose 800 years of artistic accomplishment, religious ceremony and political clout.

Entrance Towers
Kutafya Tower
The Kutafya Tower (Кутафья башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ), which forms the main visitors’ entrance today, stands apart from the Kremlin’s west wall, at the end of a ramp over the Alexander Garden. The ramp was once a bridge over the Neglinnaya River and used to be part of the Kremlin’s defences; this river has been diverted underground, beneath the Alexander Garden, since the early 19th century. The Kutafya Tower is the last of a number of outer bridge towers that once stood on this side of the Kremlin.
Trinity Gate Tower
From the Kutafya Tower, walk up the ramp and pass through the Kremlin walls beneath the 1495 Trinity Gate Tower (Троицкая башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ). At 80m it's the tallest of the Kremlin’s towers. Right below your feet were the cells for prisoners in the 16th century.
Government Buildings
Poteshny Palace & State Kremlin Palace
Immediately inside the Trinity Gate Tower, the lane to the right (south) passes the 17th-century Poteshny Palace (Потешный дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ), where Stalin lived. The yellow palace was built by Tsar Alexey Mikhailovich and housed the first Russian theatre. Here, Tsar Alexey enjoyed various comedic performances. In keeping with conservative Russian Orthodox tradition, however, after the shows he would go to the banya (Russian bathhouse), then attend a church service to repent his sins.
The bombastic marble, glass and concrete State Kremlin Palace (Государственный Кремлёвский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-620 7846; www.kremlinpalace.org/en), built between 1960 and 1961 for Communist Party congresses, is now home to the Kremlin Ballet.

Arsenal
North of the State Kremlin Palace is the 18th-century Arsenal (Арсенал MAP GOOGLE MAP ), commissioned by Peter the Great to house workshops and depots for guns and weaponry. An unrealised plan at the end of the 19th century was to open a museum of the Napoleonic Wars in the Arsenal. Now housing the Kremlin Guard, the building is ringed with 800 captured Napoleonic cannons.
Senate
The offices of the president of Russia, the ultimate seat of power in the modern Kremlin, are in the yellow, triangular former Senate (Сенат MAP GOOGLE MAP ) building, a fine 18th-century neoclassical edifice, east of the Arsenal. Built in 1785 by architect Matvei Kazakov, it was noted for its huge cupola. In the 16th and 17th centuries this area was where the boyars (high-ranking Russian nobles) lived. Next to the Senate is the 1930s Supreme Soviet (Верховный Совет MAP GOOGLE MAP ) building.
Patriarch's Palace
Patriarch's Palace (Патриарший дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ) was mostly built in the mid-17th century for Patriarch Nikon, whose reforms sparked the break with the Old Believers. In its heyday, the palace was a busy place. Apart from the Patriarch’s living quarters, it had huge kitchens, warehouses and cellars stocked with food, workshops, a school for high-born children, offices for scribes, dormitories for those waiting to be baptised, stables and carriage houses.
The palace now contains an exhibit of 17th-century household items, including jewellery, hunting equipment and furniture. It often holds special temporary exhibits, which can be visited individually, without access to the other buildings on Sobornaya pl.

Church of the Twelve Apostles
From inside the Patriarch’s Palace, you can access the five-domed Church of the Twelve Apostles (Церковь двенадцати апостолов). The pretty little chapel contains a gilded wooden iconostasis and a collection of icons by leading 17th-century icon painters.
Cross Hall
The highlight of the Patriarch’s Palace is perhaps the ceremonial Cross Hall (Крестовая палата), where feasts for the tsars and ambassadors were held. From the 18th century the room was used to produce miro (a holy oil used during church services, which contains over 30 herbal components); the oven and huge pans from the production process are on display.
KREMLIN TICKET OFFICE

The main ticket office (Кассы музеев Кремля MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Alexander Garden; h9am-5pm Fri-Wed May-Sep, 9.30am-4.30pm Fri-Wed Oct-Apr; mAleksandrovsky Sad) is in Alexander Garden, next to the Kremlin wall. The ticket to the ‘Architectural Ensemble of Sobornaya pl’ covers entry to all five church-museums, as well as Patriarch’s Palace. It does not include the Armoury, the Diamond Fund Exhibition or Ivan the Great Bell Tower, but you can and should buy those tickets here too. You can also order full-price tickets (not children's tickets) for the Kremlin churches and the Armoury on the Kremlin website, but you still have to pick them up at the ticket office in Alexander Garden.
Assumption Cathedral
On the northern side of Sobornaya pl, with five golden helmet domes and four semicircular gables facing the square, the Assumption Cathedral (Успенский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ) is the focal church of prerevolutionary Russia and the burial place of most of the heads of the Russian Orthodox Church from the 1320s to 1700. A striking 1660s fresco of the Virgin Mary faces Sobornaya pl, above the door once used for royal processions. If you have limited time in the Kremlin, come straight here. The visitors’ entrance is at the western end.

HISTORY OF THE KREMLIN

A 'kremlin' – or fortified stronghold – has existed on this site since Moscow’s earliest years. In 1147 Yury Dolgoruky summoned his allies to this spot, which would have been occupied by a wooden fort. When the city became the capital of medieval Rus in the 1320s, the Kremlin served as the headquarters of the Russian Orthodox Church and the seat of the prince.
The ambition of Ivan III (the Great) was to build a capital that would equal the fallen Constantinople in grandeur, power, achievements and architecture. In an effort to build the ‘Third Rome’, Ivan brought from Italy stonemasons and architects, who built new walls, three great cathedrals and other structures. Most of the present-day buildings date from this period.
Although Peter I (the Great) shifted the capital to St Petersburg, the tsars still showed up here for coronations and other celebrations. The fortress was captured by Napoleon, who inflicted serious damage before making his retreat in 1812. But still the ancient symbol endured. The citadel wouldn’t be breached again until the Bolsheviks stormed the place in November 1917.
The Kremlin has been open to tourists since 1955.
Construction & History
In 1470 Russian architects Krivtsov and Myshkin were commissioned by Ivan the Great to replace the old dilapidated cathedral, which dated from 1326. As soon as the ceiling was put up, one of the walls collapsed. During Soviet times, history books said this calamity was the result of bad handiwork, but today revisionist history indicates that an earthquake caused the collapse. Either way, Krivtsov and Myshkin lost their jobs, and Italian architect Aristotle Fioravanti was given a crack at it. After the foundation was completed, Fioravanti toured Novgorod, Suzdal and Vladimir to acquaint himself with Russian architecture. His design is a more spacious version of the Assumption Cathedral at Vladimir, with a Renaissance twist.
The church closed in 1918. According to some accounts, in 1941, when the Nazis were on the outskirts of Moscow, Stalin secretly ordered a service in the cathedral to protect the city from the enemy. The cathedral was officially returned to the Church in 1989, but it now operates as a museum.
Frescoes & Murals
The interior of the Assumption Cathedral is unusually bright and spacious, full of frescoes painted in warm golds, reds and blues. The west wall features a scene of the Apocalypse, a favourite theme of the Russian Church in the Middle Ages. The pillars have pictures of martyrs, considered to be the pillars of faith. Above the southern gates there are frescoes of Yelena and Constantine, who brought Christianity to Greece and the south of Russia. The space above the northern gate depicts Olga and Vladimir, who brought Christianity to the north.
Most of the existing images on the cathedral walls were painted on a gilt base in the 1640s, with the exception of three grouped together on the south wall: The Apocalypse (Апокалипсис), The Life of Metropolitan Pyotr (Житие Митрополита Петра) and All Creatures Rejoice in Thee (О тебе радуется). These are attributed to Dionysius and his followers, the cathedral’s original 15th-century mural painters.
Patriarchs' Tombs
The tombs of many leaders of the Russian Church (metropolitans up to 1590, patriarchs from 1590 to 1700) are against the north, west and south walls of Assumption Cathedral. Near the west wall is a shrine with holy relics of Patriarch Hermogen, who instigated an uprising during the Time of Troubles in 1612. Also a supporter of Minin and Pozharsky's revolt against the Polish occupation, the martyr was later arrested, beaten and starved to death.
Throne of Monomakh
Near the south wall, the tent-roofed wooden throne is known as the Throne of Monomakh. It was made in 1551 for Ivan the Terrible. Its carved scenes highlight the career of 12th-century Grand Prince Vladimir Monomakh of Kiev – considered to be Ivan's direct predecessor.
Iconostasis
Assumption Cathedral's iconostasis dates from 1652, but its lowest level contains some older icons. The 1340s Saviour with the Angry Eye (Спас Ярое око) is second from the right. On the left of the central door is the Virgin of Vladimir (Владимирская Богоматерь), an early-15th-century Rublyov-school copy of Russia’s most revered image, the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God (Владимирская икона Богоматери). The 12th-century original, now in Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery, stood in the Assumption Cathedral from the 1480s to 1930. One of the oldest Russian icons, the 12th-century red-clothed St George (Святой Георгий) from Novgorod, is by the north wall.
The original icons of the lower, local tier are symbols of victory brought from Vladimir, Smolensk, Veliky Ustyug and other places. The south door was brought from the Nativity of the Virgin Cathedral in Suzdal.
Church of the Deposition of the Robe
The delicate single-domed Church of the Deposition of the Robe (Церковь Ризоположения MAP GOOGLE MAP ), beside the west door of the Assumption Cathedral, was built between 1484 and 1486 in exclusively Russian style. It was the private chapel of the heads of the Church, who tended to be highly suspicious of such people as Italian architects.
Originally an open gallery or porch surrounded the church; it was later removed and the church was connected with the palace for the convenience of the tsars. The interior walls, ceilings and pillars are covered with 17th-century frescoes. It houses an exhibition of 15th- to 19th-century woodcarvings.
Ivan the Great Bell Tower
With its two golden domes rising above the eastern side of Sobornaya pl, the Ivan the Great Bell Tower (Колокольня Ивана Великого MAP GOOGLE MAP ; R250; h10am-5pm Apr-Oct) is the Kremlin’s tallest structure – a landmark visible from 30km away. Before the 20th century it was forbidden to build any higher than this tower in Moscow. Purchase a ticket for a specifically timed admission to climb the 137 steps to the top for sweeping views.
The bell tower's history dates back to the Church of Ioann Lestvichnik Under the Bells, built on this site in 1329 by Ivan I (and later destroyed). In 1505, Italian Marco Bono designed a new belfry, originally with only two octagonal tiers beneath a drum and a dome. In 1600 Boris Godunov raised it to 81m.
The building’s central section, with a gilded single dome and a 65-tonne bell, dates from between 1532 and 1542. The tent-roofed annexe, next to the belfry, was commissioned by Patriarch Filaret about 100 years later.
Architectural Exhibition
Ivan the Great houses a multimedia presentation of the architectural history of the Kremlin complex. Using architectural fragments and electronic projections, the exhibition illustrates how the Kremlin has changed since the 12th century. Special attention is given to individual churches within the complex, including several churches that no longer exist. The 45-minute audio tour ends with a 137-step climb to the top of the tall tower, yielding an amazing (and unique!) view of Sobornaya pl, with the Church of Christ the Saviour and the Moskva-City skyscrapers in the distance.
The bell tower is only open when weather allows. Purchase your ticket (for a specific admission time) at the ticket office in Alexander Garden before you enter the Kremlin grounds. The number of people admitted for each time slot is extremely limited, so it may require some flexibility.
Tsar Cannon
North of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower is the 40-tonne Tsar Cannon (Царь-пушка MAP GOOGLE MAP ). It was cast in 1586 by the blacksmith Ivan Chokhov for Fyodor I, whose portrait is on the barrel. Shot has never sullied its 89cm bore and certainly not the cannonballs beside it, which are too big even for this elephantine firearm.

Tsar Bell
Beside (not inside) the Ivan the Great Bell Tower stands the world’s biggest bell (Царь-колокол MAP GOOGLE MAP ), a 202-tonne monster that has never rung. An earlier version, weighing 130 tonnes, fell from its belfry during a fire in 1701 and shattered. Using these remains, the current Tsar Bell was cast in the 1730s for Empress Anna Ivanovna. The bell was cooling off in the foundry casting pit in 1737 when it came into contact with water, causing an 11-tonne chunk to break off. One hundred years later, the architect Montferrand took the damaged bell out of the pit and put it on a pedestal. Bas-reliefs of Empress Anna and Tsar Alexey, as well as some icons, were etched on its sides.
Archangel Cathedral
The Archangel Cathedral (Архангельский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ), at the southeastern corner of Sobornaya pl, was for centuries the coronation, wedding and burial church of tsars. It was built by Ivan Kalita in 1333 to commemorate the end of the great famine, and dedicated to Archangel Michael, guardian of the Moscow princes. By the turn of the 16th century it had fallen into disrepair and was rebuilt between 1505 and 1508 by the Italian architect Alevisio Novi. Like the Assumption Cathedral, it has five domes and is essentially Byzantine-Russian in style. However, the exterior has many Venetian Renaissance features, notably the distinctive scallop-shell gables and porticoes.
Tsarist Tombs
The tombs of almost all Muscovy’s rulers from the 1320s to the 1690s are here. The only absentee is Boris Godunov, whose body was taken out of the grave on the order of a ‘False Dmitry’ and buried at Sergiev Posad in 1606. The bodies are buried underground, beneath the 17th-century sarcophagi and 19th-century copper covers. Tsarevitch Dmitry (a son of Ivan the Terrible), who died mysteriously in 1591, lies beneath a painted stone canopy. It was Dmitry’s death that sparked the appearance of a string of impersonators, known as False Dmitrys, during the Time of Troubles. Ivan’s own tomb is out of sight behind the iconostasis, along with those of his other sons, Ivan (whom he killed) and Fyodor I (who succeeded him). From Peter the Great onwards, emperors and empresses were buried in St Petersburg, the exception being Peter II, who died in Moscow and is here.
Murals
Some 17th-century murals were uncovered during restorations of the Archangel Cathedral in the 1950s. The south wall depicts many of the rulers buried here; on the pillars are some of their predecessors, including Andrei Bogolyubsky, Prince Daniil and Alexander Nevsky.

Hall of Facets & Terem Palace
Hall of Facets
Named for its Italian Renaissance stone facing, the Hall of Facets (Грановитая палата MAP GOOGLE MAP ) was designed and built by Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario between 1487 and 1491, during the reign of Ivan the Great. Its upper floor housed the tsars’ throne room, the scene of banquets and ceremonies. The hall is 500 sq metres, with a supporting pillar in the centre. The walls are decorated with gorgeous murals of biblical and historical themes, although none are original. Alas, the building is closed to the public.
Access to the Hall of Facets was via an outside staircase from the square below. During the Streltsy Rebellion of 1682, several of Peter the Great’s relatives were tossed down the exterior Red Staircase, so called because it ran red with their blood. (It’s no wonder that Peter hated Moscow and decided to start afresh with a new capital in St Petersburg.) Stalin destroyed the staircase, but it was rebuilt in 1994.
Terem Palace
The 16th- and 17th-century Terem Palace (Теремной дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ) is the most splendid of the Kremlin palaces. Made of stone and built by Vasily III, the palace’s living quarters include a dining room, living room, study, bedroom and small chapel. Unfortunately, the palace is closed to the public, but you can glimpse its cluster of 11 golden domes and chequered roof behind and above the Church of the Deposition of the Robe.
TOWERS OF POWER

The present Kremlin walls were built between 1485 and 1495, replacing the limestone walls from the 14th century. The walls are 6m to 17m tall, depending on the landscape, and 2m to 5m thick. They stretch for 2235m. Originally, a 32m-wide moat encircled the northern end of the Kremlin, connecting the Moscow and Neglinnaya Rivers.
The 20 distinctive towers were built between 1485 and 1500, with tent roofs added in the 17th century. Originally, the towers had lookout posts and were equipped for heavy fighting. Most were designed by Italian masons.
The most prominent tower is the Saviour Gate Tower, the clock tower soaring above Red Square. Right next to it is the Tsar Tower (Царская башня), a later addition (1680), which sits on top of the Kremlin wall. Legend has it that Ivan the Terrible watched executions and other Red Square activities from the old wooden tower that previously stood on this site. Next along is the Alarm Tower (Набатная башня), which used to house the Spassky Alarm Bell, used to warn of enemy attacks and to spur popular uprisings. After quashing one such uprising, Catherine the Great was so outraged that she had the clapper removed from the bell, so it could sound no more.
The two towers anchoring the northern and southern ends of this eastern wall played important roles in the Kremlin's defences. At the corner of Alexander Garden, St Nicholas Tower (Никольская башня) was previously a gated defensive tower on the northeastern flank. Through this gate, Dmitry Pozharsky and Kuzma Minin (as depicted in the statue in front of St Basil’s Cathedral) led a civilian army and drove out the Polish occupiers. At the southern end of Red Square, Konstantin & Yelena Tower (Константино-Еленинская башня) was built to protect the settlements outside the city. It is complete with firing platforms and a drawbridge over the moat.
Annunciation Cathedral
The Annunciation Cathedral (Благовещенский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ), at the southwest corner of Sobornaya pl, contains impressive murals in the gallery and an archaeology exhibit in the basement. The central chapel features the celebrated icons of master painters Theophanes the Greek and Andrei Rublyov.
Vasily I built the first wooden church on this site in 1397. Between 1484 and 1489, Ivan the Great had the Annunciation Cathedral rebuilt to serve as the royal family’s private chapel. Originally the cathedral had just three domes and an open gallery around three sides. Ivan the Terrible, whose tastes were more elaborate, added six more domes and chapels at each corner, enclosed the gallery and gilded the roof.
Frescoes
Many murals in the Annunciation Cathedral's gallery date from the 1560s. Among them are Capture of Jericho in the northern porch, Jonah and the Whale in the northern arm of the gallery and the Tree of Jesus on its ceiling. Other frescoes feature ancient philosophers such as Aristotle, Plutarch, Plato and Socrates holding scrolls inscribed with their own wise words. Socrates’ scroll reads: ‘No harm will ever come to a good man. Our soul is immortal. After death the good shall be rewarded and the evil punished.' Plato’s says: ‘We must hope God shall send us a heavenly Teacher and a Guide’.
The small central part of the cathedral has a lovely jasper floor. The 16th-century frescoes include Russian princes on the north pillar and Byzantine emperors on the south, both with Apocalypse scenes above them.
Iconostasis
The real treasure of the Annunciation Cathedral is the iconostasis, where in the 1920s restorers uncovered early-15th-century icons by three of the greatest medieval Russian artists. It was most likely Theophanes who painted the six icons at the right-hand end of the biggest row of the six tiers of the iconostasis. From left to right, these are the Virgin Mary, Christ Enthroned, St John the Baptist, the Archangel Gabriel, the Apostle Paul and St John Chrysostom. Theophanes was a master of portraying pathos in the facial expressions of his subjects, setting these icons apart from most others.
The third icon from the left, Archangel Michael, is ascribed to Andrei Rublyov, who may also have painted the adjacent St Peter. Rublyov is also reckoned to be the artist of the first, second, sixth and seventh (and probably the third and fifth) icons from the left end of the festival row, above the deesis (biggest) row. The seven icons at the right-hand end are attributed to Prokhor of Gorodets.
Archaeological Exhibition
The basement of the Annunciation Cathedral holds a permanent exhibition on the archaeology of the Kremlin – an appropriate place, as this is actually a remnant of the 14th-century church that previously occupied this site. On display are hundreds of artefacts – glassware, ceramics, tools and woodwork – that were excavated from Borovitsky Hill in the 1960s and 1970s. Archaeologists found around 30 ‘treasure troves’, which included silver jewellery and coins dating to medieval times.
Great Kremlin Palace
Housing the Armoury and much more, the 700-room Great Kremlin Palace (Большой Кремлёвский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ) was built between 1838 and 1849 by architect Konstantin Thon as an imperial residence for Nicholas I. It is now an official residence of the Russian president, used for state visits and receptions. However, unlike the Russian tsars, the president doesn’t have living quarters here.
The huge palace incorporates some earlier buildings such as the Hall of Facets, Terem Palace and several chapels. Although vast, the building has never received great praise, being criticised as ‘barrack-like’ and ‘pretentious’. Several ceremonial halls are named after saints, including St George, St Vladimir, St Andrew, St Catherine and St Alexander. St George’s Hall is mainly used for state awards ceremonies, while major international treaties are signed in St Vladimir’s Hall.
The majority of the Great Kremlin Palace is not open to the public, but Patriarshy Dom Tours sometimes arranges tours.
Armoury
The Armoury (Оружейная палата MAP GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R700/free; htours 10am, noon, 2.30pm & 4.30pm Fri-Wed; mAleksandrovsky Sad) dates back to 1511, when it was founded under Vasily III to manufacture and store weapons, imperial arms and regalia for the royal court. Later it also produced jewellery, icon frames and embroidery. During the reign of Peter the Great all craftspeople, goldsmiths and silversmiths were sent to St Petersburg, and the Armoury became a mere museum storing the royal treasures. To this day, the Armoury still contains plenty of treasures for ogling, and remains a highlight of any visit to the Kremlin.
If possible, buy your ticket to the Armoury when you buy your ticket to the Kremlin. Your ticket will specify a time of entry. A one-hour audio guide is available to point out some of the highlights of the collection.
2Museum Tour
Armoury

SEE ARMOURY
LENGTH ONE HOUR
Your tour starts upstairs, where the first two rooms house gold and silver from the 12th to 20th centuries, many of which were crafted in the Kremlin workshops. There's jewellery, dishes and sacred items crafted from precious metals and jewels. In Room 2, you'll find the renowned 1Easter eggs made by St Petersburg jeweller Fabergé. The tsar and tsarina traditionally exchanged these gifts each year at Easter. Most famous is the Grand Siberian Railway egg, with gold train, platinum locomotive and ruby headlamp, created to commemorate the Moscow–Vladivostok line.
The following rooms display armour, weapons and more armour and more weapons. Don’t miss the helmet of Prince Yaroslav, the chainmail of Boris Godunov, and the 2sabres of Minin and Pozharsky.
Downstairs in Room 6, you can see the 3coronation dresses of 18th-century empresses (Empress Elizabeth, we’re told, had 15,000 other dresses). Look for Catherine the Great's wedding gown, which is covered with silver brocade (note the 43cm waist size!). Other 'secular' clothing is also on display, including an impressive pair of boots that belonged to Peter the Great.
The following room contains some impressive furniture, including the 800-diamond throne of Tsar Alexey. The most unusual item, perhaps, is the 4joint coronation throne of boy tsars Peter the Great and his half-brother Ivan V (with a secret compartment from which Regent Sofia prompted them). In the same room, you'll see the glittering and fur-lined crowns of the emperors through the ages. The gold 5Cap of Monomakh, jewel-studded and sable-trimmed, was used for two centuries at coronations.
End your tour in Room 9, which houses centuries’ worth of royal carriages and sledges. One of the oldest is the luxurious carriage that was a gift from King James of England to Boris Godunov in 1604. Look also for the 6sleigh in which Elizabeth rode from St Petersburg to Moscow for her coronation, pulled by 23 horses at a time – about 800 in all for the trip.
Diamond Fund of Russia
If the Armoury hasn’t sated your lust for diamonds, there are more in the separate Diamond Fund Exhibition (Алмазный фонд России MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-629 2036; www.gokhran.ru; R500; h10am-1pm & 2-5pm Fri-Wed). The fund dates back to 1719, when Peter the Great established the Russian Crown treasury. The bulk of the exhibit is gemstones and jewellery garnered by tsars and empresses, including the 190-carat diamond given to Catherine the Great by her lover Grigory Orlov. The Great Imperial Crown, encrusted with 4936 diamonds, was the coronation crown of Catherine the Great and successive rulers. Security is super tight and you are not allowed to bring cameras, phones or bags of any sort.
Alexander Garden
The first public park in Moscow, Alexander Garden (Александровский сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mAleksandrovsky Sad) sits along the Kremlin’s western wall. Colourful flower beds and impressive Kremlin views make it a favourite strolling spot for Muscovites and tourists alike. Back in the 17th century, the Neglinnaya River ran through the present gardens, with dams and mills along its banks. When the river was diverted underground, the garden was founded by architect Osip Bove, in 1821.
At the north end of Alexander Garden, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Могила неизвестного солдата MAP GOOGLE MAP ) contains the remains of one soldier who died in December 1941 at km41 of Leningradskoe sh – the nearest the Nazis came to Moscow. It is a kind of national pilgrimage spot, where newlyweds bring flowers and have their pictures taken. The inscription reads: ‘Your name is unknown, your deeds immortal'.
There’s an eternal flame, and other inscriptions listing the Soviet 'hero cities' of WWII – those that withstood the heaviest fighting – and honouring ‘those who fell for the motherland’ between 1941 and 1945. South of the tomb, a row of red urns contains earth from the hero cities.
Every hour on the hour, the guards of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier perform a perfectly synchronised ceremony to change the guards on duty.

PLANNING

Visiting the Kremlin and the Armoury is at least a half-day affair. If you intend to visit the Diamond Fund or other special exhibits, plan on spending most of the day here. If you are short on time, skip the Armoury and the Diamond Fund and dedicate an hour to admiring the historic buildings around Sobornaya pl (Cathedral Sq), the central square within the Kremlin walls.
The first stone structures in the Kremlin were built in the 1330s at the behest of Ivan ‘Moneybags’ Kalita. Only the Church of the Saviour’s Transfiguration survived into the 20th century, but it was demolished by Stalin approximately 600 years after it was built.
CHECK YOUR BAGS

Before entering the Kremlin, deposit large bags at the left-luggage office ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Alexander Garden; h9am-6.30pm Fri-Wed).
TICKETS

Full-price Armoury tickets are available for advance online purchase. Otherwise, tickets go on sale 45 minutes prior to each session. Be at the ticket window when sales begin, as ticket numbers are limited.
The director of the Kremlin museums is Elena Gagarina, the daughter of pilot and cosmonaut Yury Gagarin.
ENTRY TIMES

Visitors are allowed to enter the Armoury only at specified times (10am, noon, 2.30pm and 4.30pm). Visitors are also allowed to enter Ivan the Great Bell Tower only at specified times (10.15am, 11.15am, 1pm, 2pm, 3pm and 4pm).
STAND ON CEREMONY

Every Saturday at noon from April to October, the Presidential Regiment shows up on Sobornaya pl for a ceremonial procession, featuring some very official-looking prancing and dancing, both on foot and on horseback. The price of admission to the Kremlin allows access to the demonstration.
In 1812 French troops used the Assumption Cathedral as a stable; they also looted 295kg of gold and over 5 tonnes of silver from here, but much of it was recovered.
CAMERA SHY

Photography is not permitted inside the Armoury or in any of the buildings on Sobornaya pl (Cathedral Sq).
SPECIAL EXHIBITS

Temporary exhibits from the Kremlin collections are held on the ground floor of the Assumption Belfry and in Patriarch’s Palace.
In 1600 Boris Godunov increased the height of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower from 60m to 81m. Local legend says that this was a public works project designed to employ the thousands of people who had come to Moscow during a famine, but historical documents contradict the story, as the construction apparently did not coincide with a famine. The height was probably increased so that the belfry could also serve as a watch tower.
GET INSIDE THE GREAT KREMLIN PALACE

The Great Kremlin Palace is not open to the public, but Patriarshy Dom Tours sometimes arranges tours inside this grandiose building.
Under Orthodox law, the fourth marriage of Ivan the Terrible disqualified him from entering the church proper, so he had the southern gallery of the Annunciation Cathedral converted into the Archangel Gabriel Chapel, from where he could watch services through a grille.
DIAMOND FUND

The Diamond Fund is managed by the Ministry of Finance, which retains a monopoly on the mining and sale of precious stones. As such, the collection includes many magnificent raw diamonds, some in excess of 300 carats.
The obelisk in Alexander Garden has been restored to its original purpose, as a monument to the House of Romanovs, originally erected to commemorate the tercentenary of the royal family's rule. In 1918 it had a dramatic change in mission when it was recast as a monument to honour 'outstanding thinkers in the struggle for the liberation of workers'. Nearly 100 years later – revolutionary thinking no longer deserving of memorialising – a replica of the original Romanovsky obelisk was restored, this time to celebrate the Romanovs' 400th anniversary.

TOP SIGHT
RED SQUARE
One's first time setting foot on Red Square is a guaranteed awe-striker. The vast rectangular stretch of cobblestones is surrounded by architectural marvels, including St Basil's Cathedral. This panorama never fails to send the heart aflutter, especially at night. Furthermore, it evokes an incredible sense of import to stroll across the place where so much of Russian history has unfolded.

Resurrection Gate
At the northwestern corner of Red Square, Resurrection Gate (Воскресенские ворота MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Krasnaya pl) provides a great vantage point for your first glimpse of the square. With its twin red towers topped by green tent spires, the original 1680 gateway was destroyed because Stalin thought it an impediment to the parades and demonstrations held in Red Square. This exact replica was built in 1995. Just outside the gateway is the bright Chapel of the Iverian Virgin, originally built in the late 18th century to house the icon of the same name.
Kazan Cathedral
The little church occupying this site is a 1993 replica of the original 17th-century beauty, which was built in thanks for the 1612 expulsion of Polish invaders. The original Kazan Cathedral (Казанский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nikolskaya ul 3; h8am-7pm; mOkhotny Ryad) was founded on this site at the northern end of Red Square in 1636. For two centuries it housed the Virgin of Kazan icon, which supposedly helped to rout the Poles. Three hundred years after it was built, the cathedral was completely demolished, allegedly because it impeded the flow of celebrating workers during holiday parades.
GUM
Behind its elaborate 240m-long facade on the northeastern side of Red Square, GUM (ГУМ MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.gum.ru; Krasnaya pl 3; h10am-10pm; mPloshchad Revolyutsii) is a bright, bustling shopping mall with hundreds of fancy stores and restaurants. With a skylight roof and three-level arcades, the spectacular interior was a revolutionary design when it was built in the 1890s, replacing the Upper Trading Rows that previously occupied this site.
Pronounced goom, the initials GUM originally stood for the Russian words for ‘State Department Store’. When it was privatised in 2005, the name was officially changed to ‘Main Department Store’. Fortunately, the words for ‘state’ and ‘main’ both start with a Russian ‘G’.
Lenin's Mausoleum
Although Vladimir Ilych requested that he be buried beside his mum in St Petersburg, he still lies in state at the foot of the Kremlin wall, receiving visitors who come to pay their respects to the founder of the Soviet Union. Line up at the western corner of the square (near the entrance to Alexander Garden) to see the embalmed leader (Мавзолей Ленина MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.lenin.ru; Krasnaya pl; h10am-1pm Tue-Thu, Sat & Sun; mPloshchad Revolyutsii), who has been here since 1924. Photography is not allowed; and stern guards ensure visitors remain respectful and silent.
After trooping past the embalmed figure, emerge from the mausoleum and inspect the Kremlin wall, where other communist heavy hitters are buried, including:
AJosef Stalin Second general secretary, successor to Lenin.
ALeonid Brezhnev Fourth general secretary, successor to Khrushchev.
AFelix Dzerzhinsky Founder of the Cheka (forerunner of the KGB).
AYakov Sverdlov A key organiser of the revolution and first official head of the Soviet state.
AAndrei Zhdanov Stalin’s cultural chief and second most powerful person in the USSR immediately after WWII.
AMikhail Frunze Red Army leader who secured Central Asia for the Soviet Union in the 1920s.
AInessa Armand Lenin’s rumoured lover. The director of Zhenotdel, an organisation fighting for equality for women within the Communist Party.
AJohn Reed American author of Ten Days that Shook the World, a first-hand account of the revolution.
Saviour Gate Tower
The Kremlin’s 'official' exit onto Red Square is the stately red-brick Saviour Gate Tower (Спасская башня MAP GOOGLE MAP ). This gate – considered sacred – has been used for processions since tsarist times. The two white-stone plaques above the gate commemorate the tower’s construction in 1491. The current clock was installed in the gate tower in the 1850s. Hauling 3m-long hands and weighing 25 tonnes, the clock takes up three of the tower’s 10 levels. Its melodic chime sounds every 15 minutes across Red Square.

PHOTO OP

For an excellent photo op with good selfie potential, go around to the south side of St Basil's Cathedral, where there are unimpeded views and fewer people.
From 1953 to 1961, Lenin shared his mausoleum with Stalin. During the 22nd Party Congress, the esteemed and ancient Bolshevik Madame Spiridonova announced that Vladimir Ilych had appeared to her in a dream, insisting that he did not like spending eternity with his successor. With that, Stalin was removed and given a place of honour immediately behind the mausoleum.
PLACE OF SKULLS

The 13m circular stone platform in front of St Basil's Cathedral is known as the Place of Skulls (Лобное место MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Krasnaya pl). Legend has it that it was the site of executions; in reality, it was a stage for tsarist decrees and religious ceremonies.

TOP SIGHT
ST BASIL’S CATHEDRAL
At the southern end of Red Square stands the icon of Russia: St Basil’s Cathedral. This crazy confusion of colours, patterns and shapes is the culmination of a style that is unique to Russian architecture. In 1552 Ivan the Terrible captured the Tatar stronghold of Kazan on the Feast of Intercession. He commissioned this landmark church, officially the Intercession Cathedral, to commemorate the victory.


pavel l photo and video/shutterstock ©
Exterior
The cathedral’s apparent anarchy of shapes hides a comprehensible plan of nine main chapels. The tall, tent-roofed tower in the centre houses the namesake Church of the Intercession of the Mother of God. The four biggest domes top four large octagonal-towered chapels; and there are four smaller chapels in between, each consecrated in honour of an event or battle in the struggle against Kazan.
The onion domes were originally green, most likely acquiring their characteristic colours and patterns during an 18th-century restoration. But the church has always been a spectacle. Dutch tiles and gilded rings embellish the tent roof. Approximately 300 multicoloured, semicircular gables adorn the upper tiers of the churches, while pink and white columns and coffers decorate the lower tiers.
Church of St Vasily the Blessed
The Church of St Vasily the Blessed, the northeastern chapel on the ground floor, contains the canopy-covered crypt of its namesake saint, one of the most revered in Moscow. Vasily (Basil) the Blessed was known as a 'holy fool', sometimes going naked and purposefully humiliating himself for the greater glory of God. He was believed to be a seer and miracle maker, and even Ivan the Terrible revered and feared him. This 10th chapel – the only one at ground level – was added in 1588, after the saint's death. Look for the icon depicting St Vasily himself, with Red Square and the Kremlin in the background.
Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God
The tall, tent-roofed tower in the centre of the cathedral houses the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God. The ceiling soars to nearly 47m. Some of the walls have been restored to their original appearance (a painted red-brick pattern), while others show off fragments of oil murals that were painted later. From the vestry, the doorways into this central chapel are among the most elaborate architectural elements in the cathedral, gorgeously embellished with tile and brickwork.
Church of the Holy Trinity
With whitewashed walls and a spiralling symbol of eternity painted in the vault, the light-filled Church of the Holy Trinity is a favourite. A gorgeous 16th-century chandelier is suspended from the 20m ceiling. But the gem of the room is the unusual iconostasis. The 16th-century Icon of the Old Testament Trinity in the third tier is among the oldest and most esteemed pieces of artwork in the cathedral.
Church of St Cyprian & St Justina
The colourful Church of Sts Cyprian & Justina is adorned with oil paintings depicting the lives of the 4th-century saints, as well as Biblical stories. At 20m, the vault in the dome depicts the Mother of God of the Burning Bush. The paintings and the iconostasis date to the end of the 18th century.
Church of the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem
This chapel is dedicated to the Entry of the Lord into Jerusalem, also known in Orthodoxy as Willow Sunday. At 23m, this is one of the tallest towers in the cathedral. Whitewashed walls (as originally painted) show off the architectural elements. Above the northern entrance, you can see the scar left by a shell that hit the wall in October 1917. The iconostasis was moved from the Cathedral of St Alexander Nevsky in the Kremlin in 1770. One of the most sacred and revered pieces in the cathedral is the 17th-century icon of the Life of St Alexander Nevsky, which depicts 33 scenes from the saint's life.

AUDIO GUIDE

An audio guide to the history and architecture of St Basil's is available for R200.
Out front of St Basil’s is a statue of Kuzma Minin and Dmitry Pozharsky, one a butcher and the other a prince, who raised and led the army that ejected occupying Poles from the Kremlin in 1612.
INTERCESSION CATHEDRAL

The official name of St Basil’s Cathedral is the Intercession Cathedral. The misnomer ‘St Basil’s’ refers to the extra northeastern chapel, which was built over the grave of Vasily (Basil) the Blessed.
2Neighbourhood Walk
Red Square & Kitay Gorod

START LUBYANSKAYA PL
END STARAYA PL
LENGTH 3KM; THREE HOURS
This walk shows off the oldest and most atmospheric part of Moscow, from the grandiosity of Red Square to the intimate, ancient streets of Kitay Gorod.
Start your tour at Lubyanskaya pl, dominated by the forbidding facade of the (former) Lubyanka Prison, a once notorious place. Nearby, the modest 1Memorial to the Victims of Totalitarianism remembers the individuals who suffered within these walls.
Leave behind the institutional buildings and heavy traffic when you enter Kitay Gorod, strolling down Nikolskaya ul. This was the main road to Vladimir and used to be the centre of a busy icon trade. Today it is a pleasant pedestrian street, lined with shops, churches and cafes. You'll pass the elaborate gated walkway at 2Tretyakovsky Proezd, now home to Moscow's fanciest designer boutiques. Look also for the decorated, Gothic facade of the 3Synod Printing House – easily identified by the lion and the unicorn – and the gold-domed steeples of the 4Zaikonospassky Monastery, peeking out over the rooftops.
In Kitay Gorod it seems like there are churches and monasteries on every corner and in every courtyard. Duck down Bogoyavlensky per to get a look at another one – the 5Monastery of the Epiphany. This 13th-century monastery is the second oldest in Moscow, though the pink baroque church that stands here now was built much later.
Cut through the courtyard and out to pl Revolyutsii. This busy square displays its own impressive array of architecture. The 6Hotel Metropol is a stunning – if decaying – example of art nouveau architecture, featuring spectacular tilework by the painter Mikhail Vrubel.
Further west, the unusual 7Four Seasons Moscow exhibits two contrasting architectural styles, thanks to a funny fluke of history. The story goes that Stalin was shown two possible designs for the Hotel Moskva on Manezhnaya pl. Not realising they were alternatives, he approved both. The builders did not dare point out his error, and so built half the hotel in constructivist style and half in Stalinist style. The current building is a recreation of the 1935 original.
On the south side of the square, you'll notice the impressive red-brick facade of the 8War of 1812 Museum and the 9State History Museum, both exhibiting Russian Revival and neo-Renaissance grandeur. A statue of the WWII general (and hero) Georgy Zhukov stands stoically in front.
Turn south and walk between the two museums – through Resurrection Gate – and feast your eyes on the glorious display in front of you: the stunning expanse of aRed Square. On the south side, the mighty Kremlin wall is punctuated by tall towers, most notably the Saviour Gate Tower. Beneath the wall, Lenin's Mausoleum still receives visitors, paying their respects. On the north side, the pretty little Kazan Cathedral complements the ornate facade of GUM. And at the far end, with its electrifying assemblage of shapes, colours and textures, stands Russia's most famous landmark, bSt Basil's Cathedral. Walk across the expanse of cobblestones and get a good look at the amazing architecture.
At the southern end of Red Square, turn left on ul Varvarka, a small street with the neighbourhood's greatest concentration of ancient buildings. Walking from west to east, you'll pass the pink-and-white cSt Barbara's Church, dating to 1804; the peak-roofed dOld English Court, dating to the 16th century; the 17th-century eChurch of St Maxim the Blessed; the monks’ building and golden-domed cathedral of the fMonastery of the Sign; the ancient gChambers of the Romanov Boyars; and the 1658 hSt George’s Church. On the opposite side of the street are the trading arcades of Gostinny Dvor. Surrounded by this concentration of aged buildings, it's possible to imagine what 'Old Moscow' was like.
South of ul Varvarka and running down to the river, the 14th-century Zaryadye district was once home to Moscow's garment industry, as well as a large Jewish population. The district was razed in the 1940s to make way for a gargantuan hotel. In the 21st century, the area is transformed once again, as the site of the highly anticipated iPark Zaryadye, which will contain four museums and a concert hall, in addition to innovative landscape design.
Continue east and emerge onto Staraya pl. In the underground passage on the corner, look out for the jremains of the old city wall. This perekhod walkway is also the entrance to the Kitay-Gorod metro station.
1SIGHTS

The neighbourhood of Red Square and Kitay Gorod is only about 1 sq km, but it is densely packed with sights. Most of them are clustered right around the square itself (and in the Kremlin). East of the square, the streets of Moscow's oldest neighbourhood are lined with churches and interesting architecture, and Park Zaryadye will soon occupy the plot of land next to the river.

VLADIMIR I STATUEMONUMENT
(Памятник Владимиру Великому MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Borovitskaya pl)
In 2016 Vladimir Putin unveiled a new monument dedicated to his namesake Vladimir I, ruler of Kyivan Rus from 980 to 1015. At 17m high, the massive statue towers over the surrounding Borovitskaya pl. Vladimir is credited with uniting the fledgling Russian state and establishing the Orthodox Church.
With the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, the statue was controversial, as Vladimir is also considered the founder of the Ukrainian nation.

(Выставочный центр Манеж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://moscowmanege.ru; Manezhnaya pl; exhibits R200-300; h11am-8pm Tue-Sun; mBiblioteka im Lenina)
The long, low neoclassical building is Moscow Manege, a vast space that is used for art exhibitions and other events. In the works is a permanent exhibit dedicated to the iconic Soviet sculpture Worker & Kolkhoz Woman, on display at VDNKh. Other events are wide-ranging, including exhibitions, concerts, poetry readings, film screenings and more.
STATE HISTORY MUSEUMMUSEUM

At the northern end of Red Square, the State History Museum has an enormous collection covering Russian history from the time of the Stone Age. The building, dating from the late 19th century, is itself an attraction – each room is in the style of a different period or region, some with highly decorated walls echoing old Russian churches.
The exhibits about medieval Rus are excellent, with several rooms covering the Mongol invasions and the consolidation of the Russian state. The 2nd floor is dedicated to the Imperial period, with exhibits featuring personal items of the royals, furnishings and decoration from the palace interiors, and various artworks and documents from the era. Specific rooms are dedicated to the rules of various tsars. An unexpected highlight is an exhibit addressing the expansion of the Russian Empire by examining the growing network of roads and how people travelled.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей археологии Москвы MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mosmuseum.ru; Manezhnaya pl 1; adult/child R300/150; h10am-8pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun, 11am-9pm Thu; mOkhotny Ryad)
An excavation of Voskresensky Bridge (which used to span the Neglinnaya River at the foot of Tverskaya ul) uncovered coins, clothing and other artefacts from old Moscow. The museum displaying these treasures is situated in a 7m-deep underground pavilion that was formed during the excavation itself. The entrance is at the base of the Four Seasons Moscow hotel.
GEORGY ZHUKOV STATUESTATUE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Manezhnaya pl)
Georgy Zhukov was Chief of Staff of the Red Army during the Great Patriotic War. He oversaw the defence of both Leningrad and Stalingrad, as well as the Battle of Moscow. The centrepiece of Manezhnaya pl, he is depicted riding his upon his steed.
WAR OF 1812 MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей отечественной войны 1812 года MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.shm.ru; pl Revolyutsii 2; adult/child R350/150; h10am-6pm Sun-Thu, to 9pm Fri & Sat, closed Mon Sep-May; mPloshchad Revolyutsii)
Part Russian Revival, part neo-Renaissance, this red-brick beauty was built in the 1890s as the Moscow City Hall and later served as the Central Lenin Museum. It was converted into the War of 1812 Museum in honour of the war's 200-year anniversary. Artwork, documents, weapons and uniforms are all on display, with good multimedia exhibits offering a detailed depiction of the events and effects of the war.
Exhibits provide detailed, chronological coverage of all phases of the war, with good signage in English. There are also film depictions of various battles and interactive maps to enhance your understanding of events. Highlights include a series of paintings by Vasily Verechshagin entitled 1812, old film footage of Nicholas II at Borodino and Napoleon's getaway sleigh.
KARL MARX STATUESTATUE

KITAY GORODAREA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
This 13th-century neighbourhood was the first in Moscow to grow up outside the Kremlin walls. While its name means 'China Town' in modern Russian, do not expect anything Chinese – the name derives from an old Russian word meaning 'wattle', for the supports used for the walls that protected the suburb. This is the heart of medieval Moscow and parts of the neighbourhood's walls are visible.
The main places of interest are the collection of churches, especially along ul Varvarka, and the new Park Zaryadye.

Park Zaryadye Pavilion | bestphotoplus/shutterstock ©
PARK ZARYADYE PAVILIONMUSEUM
(Павильон парка 'Зарядье' MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Moskvoretskaya ul)F
This glass-dome pavilion was the first element of Park Zaryadye to open to the public. A creation of Sergei Kuznetsov, the pavilion was designed as an 'observation deck' for the ongoing work on the park. Construction was not actually visible from the pavilion; rather, the central chamber is wallpapered in QR codes – a surprisingly appealing look – that contain maps, designs, photographs and other information about the new park. At the entrance, visitors receive tablets which they can use to decode the electronic exhibits.
Kuznetsov's design first appeared in 2012 at the Venice Biennale of Architecture, where it received high praise. Although it was originally meant to be a temporary structure, the current plan is to keep the pavilion in place as an information centre about the park. The QR-code decor will remain, but the subjects of the electronic exhibits may change. And eventually, this so-called observation deck will also offer an actual view of the park, not just a virtual one.
OLD ENGLISH COURTMUSEUM
(Палаты старого Английского двора MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mosmuseum.ru; ul Varvarka 4a; adult/child R200/100; h10am-6pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun, 11am-9pm Thu; mKitay-Gorod)
This reconstructed 16th-century house, white with wooden roofs, was the residence of England’s first emissaries to Russia (sent by Elizabeth I to Ivan the Terrible).
It also served as the base for English merchants, who were allowed to trade duty-free in exchange for providing military supplies to Ivan. Today, it houses a small exhibit dedicated to this early international exchange.
CHAMBERS OF THE ROMANOV BOYARSMUSEUM
(Палаты бояр Романовых MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.shm.ru; ul Varvarka 10; mKitay-Gorod)
This small but interesting museum is devoted to the lives of the Romanov family, who were mere boyars (nobles) before they became tsars. The house was built by Nikita Romanov, whose grandson Mikhail later became the first tsar of the 300-year Romanov dynasty. Exhibits show the house as it might have been when the Romanovs lived here in the 16th century. Enter from the rear of the building. The museum was closed for renovation at the time of research.
CHURCH OF THE TRINITY IN NIKITNIKICHURCH
(Церковь Троицы в Никитниках MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Ipatyevsky per; mKitay-Gorod)
Hidden between big government blocks, this little gem of a church is an exquisite example of Russian baroque. Built in the 1630s, its onion domes and tiers of red-and-white spade gables rise from a square tower. Its interior is covered with 1650s gospel frescoes by Simon Ushakov and others. A carved doorway leads into St Nikita the Martyr’s Chapel, above the vault of the Nikitnikov merchant family, who were among the patrons who financed the church's construction.
ZAIKONOSPASSKY MONASTERYMONASTERY
(Заиконоспасский монастырь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nikolskaya ul 7-9; mPloshchad Revolyutsii)
This monastery was founded by Boris Godunov in 1600, although the church was built in 1660. The name means ‘Behind the Icon Stall’, a reference to the busy icon trade that once took place here. The now-functioning, multitiered Saviour Church is tucked into the courtyard away from the street.
On the orders of Tsar Alexey, the Likhud brothers – scholars of Greek – opened the Slavonic Greek and Latin Academy on the monastery premises in 1687. (Mikhail Lomonosov was a student here.) The academy later became a divinity school and was transferred to the Trinity Monastery of St Sergius in 1814.
MONASTERY OF THE EPIPHANYMONASTERY
(Богоявленский монастырь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bogoyavlensky per 2; mPloshchad Revolyutsii)
This monastery is the second-oldest in Moscow, founded in 1296 by Prince Daniil, son of Alexander Nevsky. The current Epiphany Cathedral – with its tall, pink, gold-domed cupola – was constructed in the 1690s in the Moscow baroque style. If you're lucky, you may hear the bells ringing forth from the old wooden belfry nearby.
SYNOD PRINTING HOUSEHISTORIC BUILDING
(Печатный двор Синод MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nikolskaya ul 15; mPloshchad Revolyutsii)
Now housing the Russian State University for the Humanities, this elaborately decorated edifice is where Ivan Fyodorov reputedly produced Russia’s first printed book, The Apostle, in 1563. You can see a statue of the man himself nearby. Spiralling Solomonic columns and Gothic windows frame the lion and unicorn, who are facing off in the centre of the facade.
Up until the early 19th century, Kitay Gorod was something of a printing centre, home to 26 of Moscow’s 31 bookshops.
TRETYAKOVSKY PROEZDSTREET
(Третьяковский проезд MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mTeatralnaya)
The gated walkway of Tretyakovsky proezd (originally built in the 1870s) leads from Teatralny proezd into Kitay Gorod. Nearby, you can see where archaeologists uncovered the 16th-century fortified wall that used to surround Kitay Gorod, as well as the foundations of the 1493 Trinity Church. There is also a statue of Ivan Fyodorov, the 16th-century printer responsible for Russia's first book.
Back in the day, the archway was financed by the Tretyakov brothers (founders of the namesake art gallery). Apparently the construction of the medieval-style gate and the opening of the passageway were an attempt to relieve traffic on Nikolskaya ul. It was reopened in 2000 and is now lined with exclusive shops.
MEMORIAL TO THE VICTIMS OF TOTALITARIANISMMEMORIAL
(Мемориал жертвам тоталитаризма MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Lubyanskaya pl)
This humble memorial stands in the little garden south of the notorious Lubyanka Prison. The single stone slab comes from an infamous 1930s labour camp situated on the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea.
HOTEL METROPOL

The Hotel Metropol is among Moscow’s finest examples of art nouveau architecture. The decorative panel on the hotel’s central facade, facing Teatralny proezd, is based on a sketch by the artist Mikhail Vrubel. It depicts the legend of the Princess of Dreams, in which a troubadour falls in love with a kind and beautiful princess and travels across the seas to find her. He falls ill during the voyage and is near death when he finds his love. The princess embraces him, but he dies in her arms. Naturally, the princess reacts to his death by renouncing her worldly life. The ceramic panels were made at the pottery workshop at Savva Mamontov’s estate in Abramtsevo.
The ceramic work on the side of the hotel facing Teatralnaya pl is by the artist Alexander Golovin. The script was originally a quote from Nietzsche: ‘Again the same story: when you build a house you notice that you have learned something’. During the Soviet era, these wise words were replaced with something more appropriate for the time: ‘Only the dictatorship of the proletariat can liberate mankind from the oppression of capitalism’. Lenin, of course.
PARK ZARYADYE

For the first time in 50 years, Moscow is getting a major new park, and it's happening in the heart of the historic centre – just a few steps from Red Square.
Park Zaryadye will occupy a prominent site along the Moscow River, wedged into historic Kitay Gorod. It is designed by the New York firm Diller Scofidio & Renfro (DS&R), which is renowned for its use of 'wild urbanism', a technique that merges the historic city streets with wild natural habitats.The 13ha site will include four different areas representing Russia's geographic zones – tundra, steppe, forest and wetlands – flowing seamlessly into each other. The most anticipated feature, perhaps, is a sort of bridge to nowhere, which stretches out across Moskvoretskaya nab and over the Moscow River, then loops back to Zaryadye.
In addition to the parkland, Zaryadye will contain a vast outdoor amphitheatre and several new museums, built into the hillsides and showcasing Russia's natural resources and richness.
The centrepiece is the Media Centre, where visitors can watch aerial-view films such as Soaring over Russia on a 39m movie screen. In the Time Machine Room, the history of Russia unfolds on a 360-degree screen that surrounds the viewers. Other exhibits and videos show off various national parks and promote travel within Russia.
The Zapavednaya Posolstvo (Conservation Embassy) will be a state-of-the-art museum featuring a large terrarium and laboratory space, offering many educational programs. A separate ice cave – kept below freezing year-round – will feature the creations of Arctic ice artist Alexander Ponomarev.
The smaller Podzemniy Museum (Underground Museum) is an archaeological exhibition, showing off a piece of the old Kitay Gorod wall that was uncovered during excavation.
Finally, the Park Zaryadye Pavilion serves as a museum of Park Zaryadye, providing an overview of the park and its development. The building was introduced by architect Sergei Kuznetsov at the Venice Biennale of Architecture in 2012.
Park Zaryadye was inaugurated in September 2017, while the museums and other features are likely to roll out over the course of the following year.
5EATING

Considering the number of tourists who pass through Red Square every day, there's a surprising dearth of good places to eat. There are plenty of options inside the GUM and Okhotny Ryad malls: most are unappealing chain restaurants and fast-food joints, but there are a few gems. Otherwise, stroll down to the northern end of Nikolskaya ul for some excellent choices.

STOLOVAYA NO 57CAFETERIA€

Newly minted, this old-style cafeteria offers a nostalgic recreation of dining in post-Stalinist Russia. The food is good – and cheap for such a fancy store. Meat cutlets and cold salads come highly recommended. This is a great place to try ‘herring in a fur coat’ (herring, beetroots, carrots and potatoes).
FARSHBURGERS€
(Farш MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-258 4205; www.farshburger.ru; Nikolskaya ul 12; burgers R250-580; h10am-midnight; mLubyanka)
Burger mania is sweeping the capital and Farsh is at the forefront, serving gourmet burgers and amazing French fries, as well as chicken wings, barbecue ribs and grilled steaks. This is the equally tasty fast-food counterpart to neighbouring Ryby Net (except it's not always that fast during busy times).

This place has the same overpriced but appetising fare as other outlets of the ubiquitous chain, but the fabulous 'grand cafe' interior makes this one a special experience. Marble floors, art deco chandeliers and elaborate latticework evoke another era. Efficient service and excellent atmosphere.

On the 1st floor of the Nautilus shopping centre, this is a popular lunch spot for workers, shoppers and tourists recovering from Red Square. The interior is cool and contemporary, but still comfortable. The wide-ranging menu includes pizza, pasta and other Russian and European fare, so there is something for everyone.

If you don't get the name, which means 'No Fish', the sides of beef hanging in the window should give you a clue. This is where you come to get your carnivore on. Steaks are prepared from top-quality marbled meat and served with a fresh-baked baguette. There's a good wine list and custom cocktails to accompany.
If the steaks are going to bust your budget, go next door for burgers at Farsh.
BOSCO CAFEITALIAN€€€

Sip a cappuccino in view of the Kremlin. Munch on lunch while the crowds line up at Lenin’s Mausoleum. Enjoy an afternoon aperitif while admiring St Basil’s domes. Service is lacking and the menu is overpriced, but this cafe on the 1st floor of the GUM mall is the only place to sit right on Red Square and marvel at its magnificence.
The menu is wide-ranging, so you don't have to spend a fortune. Reservations recommended for dinner.
6DRINKING & NIGHTLIFE

There are only a few places to drink in Kitay Gorod – all clustered around the northern end of Nikolskaya ul. The neighbourhood is mostly quiet at night.

MANDARIN COMBUSTIBLELOUNGE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-745 0700; Mal Cherkassky per 2; hnoon-6am; W; mLubyanka)
Dining, drinking and dancing are all on offer in this sexy space. There is a long menu of Pan Asian cuisine – as well as sushi, pasta, tapas and more – served all night long for Moscow's nonstop party people. Drinks are forgettable and service is slack, but everything (and everyone) looks fine – and sometimes that's what matters.
CIDERELLABAR

On the top floor of the Nautilus shopping centre, you’ll find this small surfer beer bar. An even smaller terrace gives a fantastic view of Lubyanskaya pl. Jawsspot hails from the Urals, where they've been brewing beer in a former laundry since 2008. Now they're serving their great-tasting, cleverly named brews in the capital.
KOLKOVNABAR
(Колковна MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kolkovna.su; Lubyansky proezd 15; h11am-midnight; W; mKitay-Gorod)
This cool and cosy basement – with exposed brick walls and arcade ceiling – is the perfect setting to sip a refreshing Czech beer. There are sausages and other traditional Czech food to accompany the freshly drawn lagers and ales.

KREMLIN BALLETBALLET
(Кремлевский балет MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-620 7846; www.kremlinpalace.org; hbox office noon-8pm; mAleksandrovsky Sad)
The Bolshoi Theatre doesn’t have a monopoly on ballet in Moscow. Leading dancers also appear with the Kremlin Ballet, which performs in the State Kremlin Palace. The Bolshoi is magical, but seeing a show inside the Kremlin is something special too. The repertoire is unapologetically classical. The box office is near the entrance to the Biblioteka im Lenina metro station.
7SHOPPING

With hundreds of fancy stores and restaurants, GUM is a bright, bustling shopping mall that's worth a browse when you visit Red Square. There are a few other boutiques and souvenir stores along Nikolskaya ul.

Alena Akhmadullina’s romantic, flowing fashions have been wowing trendsetters since 2005, when the St Petersburg designer first showed her stuff in Paris. She has received loads of international attention ever since (including an invitation to provide an outfit for Angelina Jolie in the film Wanted). The subtly seductive designs are known for offering a new perspective on Russian themes.
OKHOTNY RYADMALL
(ТЦ Охотный ряд MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.ox-r.ru; Manezhnaya pl; h10am-10pm; mOkhotny Ryad)
The best part of this underground mall is the fanciful troika fountain that splashes the shoppers as they enter and exit from Alexander Garden. Aside from the clothing and electronic stores, there is a big, crowded food court.

Several commercial streets, most filled with boutiques and cafes, radiate from Teatralnaya pl towards the Boulevard Ring. Car-free Kamergersky per connects to Tverskaya ul, Moscow's main thoroughfare, lined with stately pre-Soviet and Stalin-era buildings. This is the best area in Moscow for people-watching, where government officials and business people mingle with domestic tourists and Moscow hipsters.

Lonely Planet's Top Tip
While the Bolshoi is Russia’s most famous theatre, it is not the only one. Several other opera and ballet theatres in Moscow offer the same level of professionalism and panache in their performances at a fraction of the price. If you have your heart set on going to the opera, consider the Novaya Opera – a gorgeous theatre set in charming gardens.

BOLSHOI THEATRE
The Bolshoi is still one of Moscow’s most romantic and entertaining options for a night on the town. The glittering six-tier auditorium has an electric atmosphere, evoking over 240 years of premier music and dance. Both ballet and opera are on offer.

The present pink-and-white beauty was built in 1824, and saw the premiers of Tchaikovsky’s Swan Lake in 1877 and The Nutcracker in 1919. The facade is famed for the bronze troika that is seemingly about to fly off the front. Gracing Teatralnaya Sq, the fountain by Vitali, which features bronze sculptures of the three muses, is Moscow’s oldest. A welcome supplement, Bolshoi's new stage was opened next door in 2002.
Opera and ballet directors come and go, leaving their imprint on the repertoire and generating controversy. But classic gems, such as the iconic Swan Lake and Boris Godunov, remain. There have been successful experiments with 20th-century and modern music in recent years, but they don't tend to linger for long.
Juicy stories about the Bolshoi's singers and ballerinas regularly appear in tabloids. In the last two decades, the Bolshoi has been marred by politics, scandal and even outright crime. Yet the show must go on – and it will.

Although mostly a commercial district, Tverskoy is dotted with museums and boasts the excellent Hermitage Gardens – a much-needed escape from the city madness. Beyond the Garden Ring, several major attractions are found in the quieter Novoslobodsky district and around VDNKh metro (orange line).

DETSKY MIRHISTORIC BUILDING
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-777 8077; www.detmir.ru; Teatralny pr 5/1; h10am-10pm; c)F
Dominated by the infamous KGB compound, Lubyanskaya pl made adults shiver in Soviet times, but children dreamed of coming here, because another stately edifice in the square was filled with toys and goods intended entirely for them. Although the 1950s interior was lost in a 2008 reconstruction, it's worth visiting this children's department store to check out Soviet toy fashions at the Museum of Childhood and admire sweeping views of central Moscow from a rooftop observation point above it.
Access to the museum and the roof is from the food court on the top floor of the department store, which is now primarily occupied by Western brands.
HOUSE OF UNIONSNOTABLE BUILDING
(Дом союзов MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Okhotny ryad 2/1; mTeatralnaya)
The green-columned House of Unions dates from the 1780s. Its ballroom, called the Hall of Columns, is famous as the location of one of Stalin’s most grotesque show trials: that of Nikolai Bukharin, a leading Communist Party theorist who had been a close associate of Lenin.
The House of Unions can only be accessed when they stage one of the infrequent concerts.
STATE DUMANOTABLE BUILDING
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.duma.gov.ru; Okhotny ryad 1; mOkhotny Ryad)
The glowering State Duma was erected in the 1930s for Gosplan (Soviet State Planning Department), source of the USSR’s Five-Year Plans. It is now the seat of the Russian parliament, and is closed to public.
TVERSKAYA PLOSHCHADHISTORIC SITE
(Тверская площадь MAP GOOGLE MAP )
A statue of the founder of Moscow, Yury Dolgoruky, presides over this prominent square near the bottom of Tverskaya ul. So does Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, as the buffed-up five-storey building opposite is the Moscow mayor’s office.
Many ancient churches are hidden in the surrounding backstreets, including the 17th-century Church of Sts Kosma and Damian.
MUSEUM OF SOVIET ARCADE MACHINESMUSEUM
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-628 4515; http://15kop.ru; ul Kuznetsky most 12; incl tour R450; h11am-9pm; mKuznetsky Most)
Growing up in 1980s USSR was a peculiar, but not necessarily entirely bleak experience. Here is an example – a collection containing dozens of mostly functional Soviet arcade machines. At the entrance, visitors get a paper bag full of 15-kopek Soviet coins, which fire up these recreational dinosaurs that would look at home in the oldest episodes of Star Trek.
Most of the games test your shooting or driving skills. Times and attitudes were different, so don't be surprised by having to target fluffy squirrels and rabbits in Winter Hunt. You can also measure your force by pulling out a rather defiant turnip, or try to beat your friend in table ice hockey. If the effort makes you sweat, get some fruit-flavoured fizzy water from an authentic machine – it's only 3 kopeks! The admission ticket includes a tour, during which you get to play 15 machines.
MOSCOW MUSEUM OF MODERN ARTMUSEUM
(Московский музей современного искусства; MMOMA MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mmoma.ru; ul Petrovka 25; adult/student R450/250, joint ticket for 3 venues R500/300; hnoon-8pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun, 1-9pm Thu; mChekhovskaya)
A pet project of the ubiquitous artist Zurab Tsereteli, this museum is housed in a classical 18th-century merchant’s home, originally designed by Matvei Kazakov (architect of the Kremlin Senate). It is the perfect light-filled setting for an impressive collection of 20th-century paintings, sculptures and graphics, which include both Russian and foreign artists. The highlight is the collection of avant-garde art, with works by Chagall, Kandinsky and Malevich.
Unique to this museum is its exhibit of ‘nonconformist’ artists from the 1950s and ´60s – those whose work was not acceptable to the Soviet regime. The gallery also hosts temporary exhibits that often feature contemporary artists. Be sure not to bypass the whimsical sculpture garden in the courtyard, where Tsereteli's own strange and kitschy works are on display. There are additional MMOMA outlets, used primarily for temporary exhibits, including the one on Tverskoy bul.
UPPER ST PETER MONASTERYMONASTERY
(Петровский монастырь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; cnr ul Petrovka & Petrovsky bul; h8am-8pm; mChekhovskaya)
The Upper St Peter Monastery was founded in the 1380s as part of an early defensive ring around Moscow. The main, onion-domed Virgin of Bogolyubovo Church dates from the late 17th century. The loveliest structure is the brick Cathedral of Metropolitan Pyotr, restored with a shingle roof. When Peter the Great ousted the Regent Sofia in 1690, his mother was so pleased she built him this church.
CHURCH OF THE NATIVITY OF THE VIRGIN IN PUTINKICHURCH
(Церковь Рождества Богородицы в Путинках MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Malaya Dmitrovka 4; mPushkinskaya)
When this church was completed in 1652, Patriarch Nikon responded by banning tent roofs like those featured here. Apparently, he considered such architecture too Russian, too secular and too far removed from the Church’s Byzantine roots. Fortunately, the Church of the Nativity has survived to grace this corner near Pushkinskaya pl.
CONTEMPORARY HISTORY MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей современной истории России MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-699 6724; www.sovr.ru; Tverskaya ul 21; adult/student R250/100; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun; mPushkinskaya)
Complete with stone lions, this opulent mansion was built to host the English Club – a venue favoured by Anglophile gentlemen and native Brits in tsarist times. After a stint as the Revolution Museum in the Soviet era, it now houses exhibitions that trace Russian history from the 1905 and 1917 revolutions up to present days.
Reflecting the government's penchant for rewriting history, a popular joke goes that Russia is a country with an unpredictable past. That attitude manifested itself when the main section of the museum, dedicated to the 20th century, was closed for renovation in 2017, the year of the October Revolution's 100th anniversary – a date President Vladimir Putin is very uncomfortable with. Temporary exhibitions, including those dedicated to Putin's reign, were open at the time of writing.
oHERMITAGE GARDENSPARK
(Сады Эрмитажа MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mosgorsad.ru; ul Karetny Ryad 3; h24hr; mPushkinskaya)F
All the things that have improved Moscow parks no end in recent years fill this small, charming garden to the brim. Today, it is possibly the most happening place in Moscow, where art, food and crafts festivals, and concerts, occur almost weekly, especially in summer. Apart from the welcoming lawns and benches, it boasts a large children's playground, a summer cinema and a cluster of food and crafts kiosks. Come here to unwind and mingle with the coolest Muscovites.
The garden was created in 1894 around a theatre that saw the screening of the Lumière brothers' first film in 1896, as well as the 1898 Moscow premiere of Chekhov's Seagull – performed by the troupe that had just been scrambled together by Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko.
M’ARS CONTEMPORARY ART CENTREGALLERY
(Центр Современного Искусства М’АРС MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.marsgallery.ru; Pushkarev per 5; R950-1300; h2-8pm Tue-Fri, noon-10pm Sat & Sun; mTsvetnoy Bulvar, Sukharevskaya)
Founded by artists who were banned during the Soviet era, this gallery space includes 10 exhibit halls showing the work of top contemporary artists, as well as a cool cafe in the basement. The target audience here is people who invest in art – hence the high admission prices.

START TEATRALNAYA PL
END PUSHKIN MONUMENT
LENGTH 3KM; 3½ HOURS
Start your tour at the stately Teatralnaya pl (metro Teatralnaya), ringed with eye-catching architecture. The magnificent 1Hotel Metropol is an art nouveau masterpiece. Across the street, the 2Bolshoi Theatre is the centrepiece of the square. The Maly Theatre and the National Youth Theatre frame it on either side.
Head up ul Petrovka and turn left onto Kamergersky per. Lined with restaurants and cafes with outdoor seating, this pleasant pedestrian strip is Moscow’s prime people-watching spot. Look out for the 3Moscow Art Theatre, founded by Konstantin Stanislavsky in 1898.
From here walk up Tverskaya ul to 4Tverskaya ploshchad, home to two Moscow heroes: the centre statue is Yury Dolgoruky, founder of Moscow; across in city hall sits Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow. East of here, Stoleshnikov per is another quaint cobblestone strip, lined with fancy boutiques and trendy cafes.
From Stoleshnikov per turn left into ul Petrovka and walk north towards pl Petrovskie Vorota, named for the gates that used to guard the city. In this area, you can wander around the ancient 5Upper St Peter Monastery and the courtyard of the 6Moscow Museum of Modern Art, which contains a collection of weird and oversized sculptures by controversial Georgian artist Zurab Tsereteli.
Cross the Boulevard Ring and walk up ul Karenty Ryad to continue your tour amid the shady greenery of 7Hermitage Gardens. Get a drink at 832.05 and, in summer, give yourself a rest in a lounge chair while watching children play on the green lawn.
Exit the gardens through the back door into Uspensky per, which features the pretty 9Uspenskaya Church. Turn left into ul Malaya Dmitrovka and walk past the Lenkom Theatre towards the magnificent aChurch of the Nativity of the Virgin in Putinki.
You are now a few metres away from Pushkinskaya pl (Pushkin Sq), which Muscovites regard as the real centre of the city. In the middle of it, the bAlexander Pushkin monument is a favourite meeting point for lovers, friends and political protesters.
1Novoslobodsky
JEWISH MUSEUM & CENTRE OF TOLERANCEMUSEUM
(Еврейский музей и Центр толерантности GOOGLE MAP ; %495-645 0550; www.jewish-museum.ru; ul Obraztsova 11 str 1a; adult/student R400/200; hnoon-10pm Sun-Thu, 10am-3pm Fri; mNovoslobodskaya)
Occupying a heritage garage, purpose-built to house a fleet of Leyland double-deckers that plied Moscow's streets in the 1920s, this vast museum, filled with cutting-edge multimedia technology, tackles the uneasy subject of relations between Jews and the Russian state over the centuries. The exhibition relates the stories of pogroms, Jewish revolutionaries, the Holocaust and Soviet anti-Semitism in a calm and balanced manner. The somewhat limited collection of material exhibits is compensated for by the abundance of interactive video displays.
We especially like those that encourage visitors to search for answers to dilemmas faced by early-20th-century Jews – to stand up and fight, to emigrate or to assimilate and keep a low profile.
Russia's Jewish population was quite small until the 18th century, when the empire incorporated a vast chunk of Poland then inhabited by millions of Yiddish-speaking Jews. They were not allowed to move into Russia proper until the early 20th century – a policy that became known as the Pale of Settlement. This led to the perception of Jews as an ethnic, rather than religious group, which still lingers today.
CENTRAL MUSEUM OF THE ARMED FORCESMUSEUM
(Центральный музей Вооружённых Сил MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-681 6303; www.cmaf.ru; ul Sovetskoy Armii 2; adult/student R200/100; h10am-4.30pm Wed-Fri & Sun, to 6.30pm Sat; mDostoyevskaya)
Covering the history of the Soviet and Russian military since 1917, this massive museum occupies 24 halls plus open-air exhibits. Over 800,000 military items, including uniforms, medals and weapons, are on display. Among the highlights are remainders of the American U2 spy plane brought down in the Ural Mountains in 1960 and the victory flag raised over Berlin’s Reichstag in 1945.
MUSEUM OF DECORATIVE & FOLK ARTMUSEUM
(Всероссийский музей декоративно-прикладного и народного искусства MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-609 0146; www.vmdpni.ru; Delegatskaya ul 3 & 5; adult/student R250/130; h10am-6pm Sun, Mon, Wed & Fri, to 9pm Thu, noon-8pm Sat; mTsvetnoy Bulvar)
Just beyond the Garden Ring, this museum showcases centuries-old arts-and-crafts traditions from around Russia and the former Soviet republics. Of the 40,000 pieces in the collection, you might see khokhloma (lacquered) woodwork from Nizhny Novgorod, including wooden toys and matryoshki (nested) dolls; baskets and other household items made from birch bark, a traditional Siberian technique; intricate embroidery and lacework from the north, as well as the ubiquitous Pavlov scarves; and playful Dymkovo pottery and Gzhel porcelain.
Look also for the so-called ‘propaganda porcelain’ – fine china decorated with revolutionary themes. The museum is known for its impressive collection of palekh – black lacquer boxes and trays painted with detailed scenes from Russian fairy tales. The collection fills two rooms. It features, among others, pieces by Ivan Golikov and Ivan Markichev, often considered the originators of the palekh style.

GLINKA MUSEUM OF MUSICAL CULTUREMUSEUM
(Музей музыкальной культуры Глинки MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-739 6226; www.glinka.museum; ul Fadeeva 4; R200; hnoon-7pm Tue-Sun; mMayakovskaya)
This musicologist's paradise boasts over 3000 instruments – handcrafted works of art – from the Caucasus and the Far East. Russia is very well represented – a 13th-century gusli (traditional instrument similar to a dulcimer) from Novgorod, skin drums from Yakutia, a balalaika (triangular instrument) by the master Semyon Nalimov – but you can also see such classic pieces as a violin made by Antonio Stradivari. Recordings accompany many of the rarer instruments, allowing visitors to experience their sound.
This incredible collection started with a few instruments that were donated by the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatory at the end of the 19th century. The collection grew exponentially during the Soviet period. It was named after Mikhail Glinka in 1945, in honour of the composer’s 150th birthday.
GULAG HISTORY MUSEUMMUSEUM

Stalin's genocide is a subject many Russians prefer to forget rather than reflect on, but this modern multimedia space serves as both a learning centre and a memorial to the millions who perished in concentration camps for ‘enemies of the people’. The centrepiece display of objects handmade by prisoners is especially moving.
DOSTOEVSKY HOUSE-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Дом-музей Достоевского MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-681 1085; ul Dostoevskogo 2; adult/student R150/50; h11am-5.30pm Tue & Fri-Sun, to 6.30pm Wed & Thu; mDostoyevskaya)
Though this renowned Russian author is more closely associated with St Petersburg, Fyodor Dostoevsky was actually born in Moscow, where his family lived in a tiny apartment on the grounds of Mariinsky Hospital. He lived here until the age of 16, when he went to St Petersburg to enter a military academy. The family’s Moscow flat has been recreated according to descriptions written by Fyodor’s brother.
Visitors can see the family’s library, toys and many other personal items, including Fyodor’s quill pen, an original autograph and a wooden chest with vaulted cover he slept on during his childhood, which clearly contributed to the writer's view of the world as a place full of pain. Shedding further light on the author's psyche, the house stood next to a morgue and an asylum that received lunatics from all over the city.
EXPERIMENTANIUMSCIENCE CENTRE

Travelling with children who ask too many questions about life, the universe and everything? Here is a place that provides answers for them to ponder for a while. Experimentanium is an exciting place where children learn physics, chemistry, mechanics, acoustics, anatomy and whatnot by playing, and indeed experimenting, with a vast number of interactive exhibits.
VASNETSOV HOUSE-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Дом-музей Васнецова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-681 1329; www.tretyakovgallery.ru; per Vasnetsova 13; adult/student R300/150; h10am-5pm Wed-Sun; mSukharevskaya)
Viktor Vasnetsov was a Russian-revivalist painter, who drew inspiration from fairy tales and village mysticism. In 1894 he designed his own house in Moscow, which is now a museum. Fronted by a colourful gate, it is a charming home in neo-Russian style filled with the original wooden furniture, a tiled stove and many of the artist’s paintings. The attic studio, where he once worked, is now adorned with paintings depicting Baba Yaga and other characters from Russian fairy tales.
Early on, Vasnetsov was scorned for his fantastical style, as it was such a startling contrast to the realism of the Peredvizhniki (Wanderers, 19th-century art movement). Even Pavel Tretyakov, the most prominent patron of the arts at the time, refused to buy his paintings. However, by the turn of the century, he found a source of support in Savva Mamontov, whose financing drove the Russian-revivalist movement.
WORTH A DETOUR
VDNKH & OSTANKINO

Palaces for workers! There is no better place to see this Soviet slogan put into practice than at VDNKh ( GOOGLE MAP ; mVDNKh), which stands for Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy. The place feels like a Stalinesque theme park, with palatial pavilions, each designed in its own unique style to represent all the Soviet republics and various industries, from geology to space exploration. A thorough reconstruction, under way at the time of writing, is expected to breathe new life into the area.
Built in 1939, VDNKh was designed as the main showcase of the socialist economy and lifestyle. The highlights are two opulently decorated fountains. Positioned in the second square from the main gate, People's Friendship Fountain is surrounded by 16 gilded female figures dressed in ethnic costumes representing Soviet republics (the mysterious 16th figure stands for the Karelo-Finnish republic disbanded in 1956). Further on, the jaw-dropping Stone Flower Fountain, themed around Ural Mountains miners' mythology, is covered in semiprecious stones from the area.
Only a handful of the grandiose pavilions were open at the time of writing, and these were mostly used for commercial purposes, but the Space Pavilion has become a temporary shelter for the Polytechnical Museum and a venue for insightful natural science and technology exhibitions. Two recently added features are the giant Mosquarium, dubbed the largest oceanarium in Europe, and the My History Park compound, which contains vast multimedia exhibitions designed to support rather controversial views on history held by Vladimir Putin's entourage.
Approaching VDNKh from the metro, the soaring 100m titanium obelisk is a monument 'To the Conquerors of Space’, built in 1964 to commemorate the launch of Sputnik. In its base is the Cosmonautics Museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.kosmo-museum.ru; R250; h11am-7pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun, to 9pm Thu; mVDNKh), featuring cool space paraphernalia such as the first Soviet rocket engine and the moon rover Lunokhod. An inspiring collection of space-themed propaganda posters evokes the era of the space race.
If you reach the far end of VDNKh, you have the choice of either pressing on towards the extensive grounds of Moscow Main Botanical Gardens ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.gbsad.ru; mBotanichesky Sad), or turning left towards the quaint Ostankino Park, surrounding a namesake palace.
Nearby Sights

When the Ostankino TV Tower was built in 1967, it was the tallest free-standing structure in the world (surpassing the Empire State Building). At 540m, it is now fourth on the list. The 337m-high observation deck is open for visitors. A super-speedy lift whisks passengers up in less than 60 seconds. From the top, there are 360-degree views and – horror! – a bit of glass floor.
Admission is by guided tour only. Tours take place hourly and must be booked in advance; bring your passport. Keep in mind the 40% discount on 10am and 11am tours during weekdays.
About the holiest of Soviet icons, Worker & Kolkhoz Woman ( GOOGLE MAP ; %495-683 5640; http://moscowmanege.ru; R200; hnoon-9pm Tue-Sun; mVDNKh), a powerful monument designed by Vera Mukhina, depicts a fierce-looking couple raising the hammer and sickle and symbolising the union of peasants and the working class. Initially, the sculpture crowned the striking Soviet pavilion at Paris Expo in 1937, but it came back to Moscow in 1939. After a recent reconstruction, the monument now stands on top of an exhibition hall that resembles the Paris pavilion. Exhibitions rotate every year or so.

Like VDNKh itself, the menu represents the USSR's republics, most notably Ukraine. The borsch with smoked pork and chicken kiev are superb and indeed much better than they were in Soviet times.

This cosy place touts itself as ‘the most visited boutique’ in the flashy Stoleshnikov per, but instead of Armani clothes it celebrates arguably the most vital item on any Russian menu – pelmeni (dumplings), as well as their relatives from all around the world. Perfectly shaped, the dumplings seem fit for a catwalk display in Milan and taste even better.
The place is tucked away in a courtyard, accessed through an archway.

Designed to look like a transplant from some old-worldish European city, this unpretentious eatery is run by local celebrity chef Uilliam Lamberti. The minimalist menu includes soups, bruschettas and salads. At first glance, the place seems to consist of one long table, but there is more seating downstairs. Takeaway is available.

The two upper floors of Tsvetnoy Central Market shopping mall are filled with refined delis and cafes, some of them outstandingly good. Little snacks hailing from Basque Country in Spain have generated a bit of a cult following for Tapas & Pintxos, on the 5th floor. The Dagestani dumpling shop on the 6th floor makes for equally exciting culinary travel.

This semisecret place draws a crowd of windsurfers, among whom it still goes by the owner's name – Slavik's. A refuge for California dreamers washed onto the shore of Tverskaya, it serves delicious burgers and a good selection of beers. To enter, look for an unmarked door next to a Korean cafe.

The affable and chatty owners of this place travel the world and experiment with the menu a lot, turning burgers, pizzas and pasta into artfully constructed objects of modern culinary art. The other source of joy is a cabinet filled with bottles of ripening fruity liquors, which may destroy your budget if consumed uncontrollably (a pointless warning, we know).
The latter asset brought Delicatessen into the World's Top 50 Bars list – entering at number 50 and climbing to number 41 in 2016. Go through the archway next to Shokoladnitsa cafe, turn left and look for a green door on your right. The sign above it reads: ‘Thank you for finding us’.

Welcome to the Russian Portlandia – all the food here is organic and hails from little farms where you may rest assured all the lambs and chickens lived a very happy life before being served to you on a plate. Irony aside, this is a great place to sample local food cooked in a funky improvisational style.
Each item on the menu is attributed to an individual farmer. Geography spans from central Russia to Sakhalin. Of special note are the ales and different kinds of kvas (fermented rye-bread drink) produced on farms near Moscow. The restaurant comes with a great (if expensive) shop selling farm produce.
GOLODNY-ZLOYFUSION€€
(Голодный-Злой MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-792 7105; http://perelmanpeople.com/restoran/golodnyy-zloy; Tsvetnoy bul 2; mains R500-700; hnoon-midnight Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri & Sat; W; mTrubnaya)
Filling up with white collars from the business centre above it, this trendsetting establishment combines unlikely ingredients and cooking methods with unfailingly excellent results – just try its smoked-mussel soup or dorado cooked with sorrel. Visual art is also involved, with each dish designed to entertain the eye as much as to please the stomach.
SEVENEUROPEAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-205 0277; Dmitrovsky per 7; mains R500-900; h8am-11pm; mTeatralnaya)
You'll find a pleasant mix of post-industrial and theatrical in this dimly lit space, where low-hanging chandeliers and comfortable chairs make for a long and enjoyable evening. The menu mirrors the city outside – inventively cosmopolitan with a sprinkle of Soviet nostalgia and a strong bias towards domestic meat and vegetable producers.
The ministerial schnitzel – a hint at menus of Brezhnev-era restaurants for the party elite – is outstanding, even though it has very little in common with the prototype.
TECHNICUMEUROPEAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-230 0605; www.tehnikumbistro.ru; ul Bolshaya Dmitrovka 7/5, str 2; mains R480-650; h9am-midnight; mTeatralnaya)
Casual, friendly and focused on taste, rather than trying to impress with shocking exoticism, Technicum is one of the places that shape the modern outlook of Moscow's culinary scene. The laconic menu contains a short list of fish and meat dishes (note the outstanding mutton with aubergine) as well as soups, including an exemplary borsch (beetroot soup) served with Borodinsky rye bread.
SHELL, YES! SEAFOOD BARSEAFOOD€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-621 2735; www.facebook.com/shellseafoodbar; Rozhdestvensky bul 10/7; mains R600-1300; h6pm-midnight; mTrubnaya)
Not a gas station, this small place defies geography by teleporting guests from Boulevard Ring to an oceanfront tavern. Displayed at the entrance, fish and oysters come from as far away as Sri Lanka and New Zealand, but it feels like the schooner that brought them is moored right outside. The cooking and wine list don't fail to impress either.
CAFE TAJINEMOROCCAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-919-764 4440; http://cafetagine.ru; Trubnaya ul 15; mains R570-1100; h9am-11pm Sun-Thu, to 12.30am Fri & Sat; mTrubnaya)
With a reputation as a bohemian hang-out, this place specialises in modern Moroccan cuisine. Prominently on the menu are four types of tajine (slow-cooked stew with meat and vegetables) and numerous meze snacks. Worth a special note is the long (and stellar) list of desserts, such as date pudding with caramel, tahini ice cream and pomegranate granita.
VORONEZHINTERNATIONAL€€
(Воронеж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.voronej.com; ul Bolshaya Dmitrovka 12/1, str 1; mains R300-720; h9am-9pm; mTeatralnaya)
Its darkened, scarlet-coloured interior makes this bistro look a bit like an oriental opium den, but it is in fact a carnivore temple, where patrons seem to fall into a deeply meditative state while munching on their burgers and excellent pastrami sandwiches. One of the best places for lunch in the city centre.
FRESHVEGETARIAN€€
(Свежий MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-965-278 9089; www.freshrestaurant.ru; ul Bolshaya Dmitrovka 11; mains R500-650; h11am-11pm; WE; mTeatralnaya)
Fresh out of Canada, this is the kind of vegetarian restaurant that people pour into not for lifestyle reasons, but because the modern, postethnic food and the escapist ambience are great. Definitely go for the smoothies. Vegans and rawists will not feel neglected.
BARASHKAAZERBAIJANI€€
(Барашка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-625 2895; www.novikovgroup.ru; ul Petrovka 20/1; mains R500-950; h11am-midnight; mTeatralnaya)
Yes, it's expensive – but it’s also a sophisticated setting, done up as an understated Baku courtyard, adorned with jars of pickled lemons and blooming plants. Barashka offers a menu full of fresh tasty salads, grilled meats and slow-cooked stews, many of which feature the little lamb, for which the restaurant is named.
UZBEKISTANUZBEK€€
(Узбекистан MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-623 0585; www.uzbek-rest.ru; Neglinnaya ul 29; mains R350-1000; hnoon-3am; aE; mTrubnaya)
This place opened in 1951 by order of the Ministry of Trade of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Six decades later, the place has expanded its menu to include Chinese, Arabic and Azeri food, in addition to the Uzbek standards. Make yourself comfortable on the plush cushions and order some spicy plov (pilaf-like meat and rice) or delicious fried kebabs.
Now brace yourself for a belly-dancing show.
DZHONDZHOLIGEORGIAN€€
(Джонджоли MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-650 5567; www.ginzaproject.ru; Tverskaya ul 20/1; mains R380-690; h11am-midnight; WE; mPushkinskaya)
Exposed brick walls, wood and wicker furniture and muted tones ensure that the focus of the Dzhondzholi dining room is the open kitchen, where the chefs are busy preparing delicious dolma (stuffed vine leaves), khachapuri (cheese bread), kharcho (rice with beef or lamb soup) and other authentic favourites.
Fun fact: food connoisseur and cookbook author Darra Goldstein explains in her book A Georgian Feast that dzhondzholi is ‘a garlicky long-stemmed green, usually eaten pickled’, which is common in Georgian cuisine. Try it for R280.
TRATTORIA VENEZIAITALIAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.trattoria-venezia.ru; Strastnoy bul 4/3; meals R400-800; h11am-midnight; mChekhovskaya)
Pretend that the Boulevard Ring is the Grand Canal. Imagine the cars ensconced in traffic are really gondolas, and the billboard-plastered facade of the Pushkinsky Cinema is actually the Ducal Palace. If you’re still reading, then the Trattoria Venezia is for you. The long menu includes more than 25 pasta plates, as well as pizza, risotto, lasagne and Italian-style meat and fish dishes.
COURVOISIER CAFEEUROPEAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-632 9995; www.courvoisier-cafe.ru; Malaya Sukharevskaya pl 8; mains R380-650; h24hr; vE; mSukharevskaya)
This informal, French-themed cafe is furnished with picnic tables and park benches, evoking an idyllic outdoor setting. (There is outdoor seating too, but fronting the Garden Ring, it is not so peaceful.) Serving breakfast, soups, pasta and grills, it’s a popular spot for breakfast, happy hour (4pm to 7pm) or a late-night snack.
SCANDINAVIASWEDISH€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-937 5630; www.scandinavia.ru; Maly Palashevsky per 7; mains R600-1000; WEc; mPushkinskaya)
In most parts of the world, Swedish cuisine is not really celebrated; in Moscow, it is. Much beloved of Moscow expats, Scandi offers an enticing interpretation of what happens ‘when Sweden meets Russia’. A delightful summer cafe, it features sandwiches, salads and treats from the grill (including the best burgers in Moscow, by some accounts).
oBRASSERIE MOSTFRENCH€€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-660 0706; www.brasseriemost.ru; ul Kuznetsky most 6/3; mains R1000-3000; h8am-midnight Mon-Fri, from 9am Sat & Sun; mTeatralnaya)
Moscow's most venerated and erudite restaurateur Alexander Rappoport shares his love for regional French cuisine in this classy and expensive place on Kuznetsky most. The menu is a grand gastrotour taking in seemingly every major area of France from Brittany to Alsace. Authenticity is religion here. If they say bouillabaisse, you can be sure it will taste exactly like Marseilles' best.
5Novoslobodsky

Among myriad Georgian places in Moscow, Batoni is about the loveliest and the most scrupulous at sourcing all the right ingredients for century-old recipes. Pkhali (walnut paste) snacks, khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread) and lamb shashlyk kebabs are all up to Mt Kazbek–high standards. For a proper taste of Georgia, order a bottle of Mukuzani or Kindzmarauli – the country's best reds.

This quirky place, a cross between a corner shop and a hip falafel joint, also makes top-quality shawarma (grilled meat and salad wrapped in flat bread) in the fashionably open kitchen. The shop section has a good selection of Israeli vegetable preserves, fruit and wine.
GOKOSGREEK€
(Гокос MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-670 9298; Sushhevskaya ul 19/4; lunch meals R290; h10am-10pm; mMendeleyevskaya)
The gyros craze is gradually spreading around Moscow, with Greek eateries opening here and there, but this place is outstanding. Simple as it is – meat slices in a pita – gyros has never been served with so much style, not in Moscow anyway. Owners hailing from the fashion industry must be the explanation. Excellent Greek frappé, too!
MADAME WONGCHINESE€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-280 1566; www.madamewong.ru; ul Lesnaya 7; mains R540-980; hnoon-midnight; mBelorusskaya)
Suit-and-tie corporates from nearby business centres throng to this classy Hong Kong restaurant that celebrates Cantonese cuisine while also flirting with Japan. The menu includes numerous kinds of super-tender dim sum, the classic crispy duck and more unusual items, such as Hainan black curry. Note the Japanese section – the crab cakes and octopus are delicious!
DRUZHBACHINESE€€€
(Дружба MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-973 1212; Novoslobodskaya ul 4; mains R700-1200; h11am-11pm; v; mNovoslobodskaya)
Druzhba earns high marks for authenticity, and as far as Sichuan cuisine goes that means spicy. Chinese restaurants in Moscow are notorious for turning down their seasoning to appeal to Russian taste buds, but Druzhba is the exception, which explains why this place is often packed with Chinese patrons. The chicken with peppers gets red-hot reviews.
6DRINKING & NIGHTLIFE

There are plenty of bars in the inner part of the district, inside the Garden Ring. Outside it, Mendeleyevskaya metro area and Flakon are two growing pub-crawling scenes.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-903-136 7686; www.noorbar.com; ul Tverskaya 23/12; h8pm-3am Mon-Wed, to 6am Thu-Sun; mPushkinskaya)
There is little to say about this misleadingly unassuming bar, apart from the fact that everything in it is close to perfection. It has it all – prime location, convivial atmosphere, eclectic DJ music, friendly bartenders and superb drinks. Though declared 'the best' by various magazines on several occasions, it doesn't feel like they care.
32.05CAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-905-703 3205; www.veranda3205.ru; ul Karetny Ryad 3; h11am-3am; mPushkinskaya)
The biggest drinking and eating establishment in Hermitage Gardens, this verandah positioned at the back of the park's main building looks a bit like a greenhouse. In summer, tables (and patrons) spill out into the park, making it one of the city's best places for outdoor drinking. With its long bar and joyful atmosphere, the place also heaves in winter.
ENTHUSIASTBAR
(Энтузиаст MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Stoleshnikov per 7, str 5; hnoon-11pm Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri & Sat; mTeatralnaya)
Scooter enthusiast, that is. But you don't have to be one in order to enjoy this superbly laid-back bar hidden at the far end of a fancifully shaped courtyard and disguised as a spare-parts shop. On a warm day, grab a beer or cider, settle into a beach chair and let harmony descend on you.
GLAVPIVMAGCRAFT BEER
(Главпивмаг MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-965-223 4492; http://glavpivmag.com; Tverskaya ul 18; h10am-3am; mTverskaya)
Strategically located on the city's busiest square, this place has nothing but a long bar and lots of taps pumping from barrels, representing dozens of microbreweries from all over Russia and its near vicinity. This is Moscow's craft-beer central. The brew can be consumed on the spot or poured into takeaway bottles.
TAP & BARRELIRISH PUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-636 2904; http://tbpub.ru; ul Bolshaya Dmitrovka 13; hnoon-midnight Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat; mTeatralnaya)
Amid the craft-beer mayhem, a good old – and not-so-fake – Irish pub feels like a welcome refuge. Occupying a vast cellar space with vaulting bare brick walls, it is the place to befriend English-speaking veteran expats over a pint of Guinness, or to watch football on a large screen.
CAFE MARTCAFE
(Кафе Март MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cafemart.ru; ul Petrovka 25; h11am-midnight Sun-Wed, 11am-6am Thu-Sat, jazz concert 9pm Thu; mChekhovskaya)
It looks like just another cellar bar, but if you walk all the way through the underground maze you'll find yourself in the huge overground 'orangerie' hall with mosaic-covered walls, warm lighting and possibly a jazz concert. When the weather is fine, Mart spills into the sculpture-filled courtyard of the adjacent Moscow Museum of Contemporary Art.
GOGOLCLUB
(Гоголь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.gogolclub.ru; Stoleshnikov per 11; hnoon-5am; mTeatralnaya)
Fun, informal and affordable (so surprising on swanky Stoleshnikov), Gogol is great for food, drinks and music. The underground club takes its bunker theme seriously, notifying customers that their food is ready with an air-raid siren. In summer the action moves out to the courtyard, where the gigantic tent is styled like an old-fashioned street scene.
HEROESPUB
(Герои MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/theheroesbar; Trubnaya ul 23; h2pm-midnight; mTsvetnoy Bulvar)
Giant murals depicting Russian countercultural icons – Vladimir Vysotsky, Shnur and Sergei Bodrov Jr – observe a merry crowd of hipsters ticking off new items on the endless list of local and foreign craft beers. It is unambitiously local with occasionally sloppy service, but full of loyal regulars and great for a quiet conversation over a pint or two.
KAMCHATKABAR
(Камчатка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.novikovgroup.ru; ul Kuznetsky most 7; h10am-1am Sun-Thu, noon-3am Fri & Sat; mTeatralnaya)
Kamchatka is a generic term for all things fringe, and this cavernous pub seems to have been designed to prove that beer can go for R80 even in a prime location in front of the TsUM department store. But make sure you ask for their trademark Kamchatka beer, or you'll get an expensive one.
Kamchatka is best in summer, when you and your friend the pint can walk out into the street to enjoy the sunshine with fellow lumpen intellectuals.
SIMACHYOVBAR
(Симачёв MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Stoleshnikov per 12/2; h11am-last guest; mChekhovskaya)
By day it’s a boutique and cafe, owned and operated by the famed fashion designer of the same name; by night, this place becomes a hip-hop-happening nightclub that combines glamour and humour. The eclectic decor includes leopard-skin rugs tossed over tile floors, toilet stools pulled up to a wash-basin bar, Catholic confessionals for private dining, and more.
You still have to look sharp to get in here, but at least you can be bohemian about it.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-929-989 7864; www.facebook.com/pg/fcpub; Novoslobodskaya ul 16a; h6pm-10am; mMendeleyevskaya)
The scale of the craft beer craze is so terrifying for some folks in Moscow, they've decided it's time for a backlash. This large pub has no Russian beer on principle – only British and other international brands, most of which you probably know. A separate team operating on the same premises serves excellent grilled meat.
The more inquisitive of you may find an unassuming little door leading to a popular clandestine speakeasy bar on the same premises, but that's as many clues as we can give!
SVOBODABAR
( GOOGLE MAP ; Novodmitrovskaya ul 1, str 9; hnoon-11.30pm; mDmitrovskaya)
A flagship of the new converted factory space, Khlebozavod 9, this is a relatively large two-level bar specialising in craft beer. At the end of the week, local bands play live gigs on the stage shaped like a rollerblading ramp. Food is served, too.
CAFE BROCARDBAR
( GOOGLE MAP ; %495-646 7843; www.facebook.com/CAFEBROCARD; Bolshaya Novodmitrovskaya 36, str 1; hnoon-late; mDmitrovskaya)
Cool cats from Flakon, notably journalists from Dozhd, Russia's only independent TV channel, congregate here after work to sip cocktails and chat. As often happens with places that become local institutions, there is nothing special about this one except a really cool crowd (and good cocktails). There’s an open-air verandah in summer.
WORTH A DETOUR
FLAKON & KHLEBOZAVOD 9

Like the Bolsheviks a hundred years ago, Moscow hipsters are capturing one factory after another and redeveloping them, according to their tastes. Flakon ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.flacon.ru; ul Bolshaya Novodmitrovskaya 36; mDmitrovskaya) is arguably the most visually attractive of all the redeveloped industrial areas around town, its mixture of brightly painted buildings and bare red brick resembling Portobello Rd in London. Once a glassware plant that produced bottles for the perfume industry, it is now home to dozens of funky shops and other businesses. Shopping for designer clothes and unusual souvenirs is the main reason for coming here.
The main shopping area covers three floors of the factory's central building. Climb to the top to find Zaporozhets Heritage ( GOOGLE MAP ; %925-465 3410; http://zaporojec.ru; ul Bolshaya Novodmitrovskaya 36; h11am-9pm; mDmitrovskaya) – a shop representing a brand that produces clothes themed on classic Soviet children's cartoons. Weekends are the best time to visit as this is when you are most likely to encounter a festival or craft fair. You'll also find several cool cafes, a cinema and even a summertime swimming pool in the area.
Khlebozavod 9 fills the gap between Flakon and Dmitrovskaya metro station. Exiting the latter, walk about 100m away from the busy avenue and you'll find the back entrance to this new space. The front entrance is across the road from Flakon.
A former bread factory (a giant Soviet-era bakery designed to cater to millions), Khlebozavod 9 was filling up with tenants at the time of writing, one of the early comers being Svoboda bar, a craft-beer and music venue. The other notable resident is Moscow ArchiGeek, which runs guided tours of the city's architectural landmarks.

This theatre company was founded in 1991 by then-mayor Luzhkov and artistic director Evgeny Kolobov. Maestro Kolobov stated, ‘We do not pretend to be innovators in this beautiful and complicated genre of opera’. As such, the ‘New Opera’ stages the old classics, and does it well.

Founded in 1880, this circus is now named after beloved actor and clown Yury Nikulin (1921–97), who performed at the studio here for many years. Nikulin’s shows centre on a given theme, which serves to add some cohesion to the productions. There are lots of trapeze artists, tightrope walkers and performing animals.

‘Maly’ means small, meaning smaller than the Bolshoi across the street. Actually, the name dates back to the time when there were only two theatres in town: the opera theatre was always called the ‘Bolshoi’, while the drama theatre was the ‘Maly’. Founded in 1824, it mainly features performances of 19th-century works by Ostrovsky and his fellow classic playwrights.

Boasting one of Moscow’s most talented theatre producers, Konstantin Raikin, as well as a host of big-name directors, the Satirikon earned a reputation in the early 1990s with its outrageously expensive production of the Threepenny Opera. It has since broken its own record for expenditure with Chantecler, which featured ducks, cockerels and hens dancing on stage.

This sweet little boutique houses a cooperative of four designer gift producers. The rather cramped space is filled with hundreds of useful and useless (but pretty) items, including Galereyka's felt slippers and hats (some shaped as Soviet tanks) and Ptitsa Sinitsa's stylish ceramics with Eastern European folklore motifs.
STANISLAVSKY'S METHODS

In 1898, over an 18-hour restaurant lunch, actor-director Konstantin Stanislavsky and playwright-director Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko founded the Moscow Art Theatre as the forum for method acting. The theatre is known by its Russian initials, MKhT, short for Moskovsky Khudozhestvenny Teatr.
More than just providing another stage, the Art Theatre adopted a ‘realist’ approach, which stressed truthful portrayal of characters and society, teamwork by the cast (not relying on stars) and respect for the writer. ‘We declared war on all the conventionalities of the theatre… in the acting, the properties, the scenery, or the interpretation of the play’, Stanislavsky later wrote.
This treatment of The Seagull rescued playwright Anton Chekhov from despair after the play had flopped in St Petersburg. Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard all premiered in the MKhT. Gorky’s The Lower Depths was another success. In short, the theatre revolutionised Russian drama.
Method acting’s influence in Western theatre has been enormous. In the USA Stanislavsky’s theories are, and have been, the primary source of study for many actors, including such greats as Stella Adler, Marlon Brando, Sanford Meisner, Lee Strasberg, Harold Clurman and Gregory Peck.
MKhT, now technically called the Chekhov Moscow Art Theatre, still stages regular performances of Chekhov’s work, among other plays.

Sanduny is the oldest and most luxurious banya (hot bath) in the city. The Gothic Room is a work of art with its rich woodcarving, while the main shower room has an aristocratic Roman feel to it. There are several classes, as on trains; regulars say that second male top class is actually better than the premium class.
No matter which class you choose, it will be a costly experience, especially if you rent the essential items – a sheet to wrap yourself (R250), a felt hat to avoid burning your hair and a pair of slippers.

Presnya encompasses some of the capital’s oldest neighbourhoods as well as its newest developments. Start by exploring the lovely residential areas of Inner Presnya, chock-full of evocative architecture, historic parks and fantastic drinking and dining spots. The whole neighbourhood is a wonderful place for a wander, especially with a copy of Mikhail Bulgakov’s Presnya-set novel The Master and Margarita in hand. Come in the late afternoon, then stay for dinner – the area around Patriarch’s Ponds has emerged as a dining hotspot, with restaurants lined up along Spiridonovsky per.
The more traditional sights – the state-of-the-art planetarium and the newly renovated zoo – are set on the busy Garden Ring (ring road 3km from the Kremlin). Further out, the metallic spires of the Moscow International Business Centre are the symbol of the 21st-century capital.
In Outer Presnya, the wide roads, heavy traffic and ongoing construction mean this part of the district is not particularly user-friendly. Make the trip only if you have your heart set on a particular destination.
Local Life
AParks Packs of teens, grandmothers with wee ones and starry-eyed couples all congregate at Patriarch’s Ponds to sit on the shady benches and feed the ducks.
ABakery The queue often runs out the door as loyal patrons wait their turn for the city’s best freshly baked breads, pastries and pies at Volkonsky.
ABrunch Weekends at Scramble are an expat institution.
Getting There & Away
AInner Presnya Inner Presnya is most easily accessed from Mayakovskaya station on line 2 (green) or Pushkinskaya station on line 7 (purple).
AOuter Presnya For the more western parts of the district, the most useful metro stations are at Kudrinskaya pl: Barrikadnaya on line 7 and Krasnopresnenskaya on line 5 (Ring line).
AInternational Business Centre The new development around the International Business Centre has its own mini metro spur branching off from Kievskaya station, with convenient stops at Vystavochnaya and Mezhdunarodnaya.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
In the backstreets around Bolshaya Nikitskaya ul, many old mansions have survived – some renovated, others dilapidated. Most of those on the streets closest to the Kremlin were built by the 18th-century aristocracy, while those further away were built by rising 19th-century industrialists. Nowadays many of these buildings are occupied by embassies and cultural institutions. With little traffic, Bolshaya Nikitskaya ul is excellent for a quiet ramble.

1SIGHTS

The pleasant, walkable streets of Inner Presnya are home to some of the district's smaller sights – parks, churches and noteworthy homes. But the biggest draws are located on the Garden Ring and even further out.

1Inner Presnya
CHURCH OF THE RESURRECTIONCHURCH
(Храм Воскресения Словущего на Успенском вражке MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.vslov.ru; Bryusov per 15/2; mPushkinskaya)
Through the arch from Tverskaya ul, the rosy-pink, gold-domed Church of the Resurrection was one of the few churches to remain open throughout the Soviet period and so attracted artists and performers from the surrounding theatre district. Even acclaimed actor and director Konstantin Stanislavsky was apparently sighted here.
CHURCH OF THE LESSER ASCENSIONCHURCH
(Храм Малое Вознесение MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://mvoznesenie.ru; Bolshaya Nikitskaya ul)
Built in the early 17th century, the festive Church of the Lesser Ascension features whitewashed walls and primitively carved stone embellishments.
ART4.RUGALLERY
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-136 5656; www.art4.ru; Khlynovsky tupik 4; h11am-7pm Mon-Fri; mOkhotny Ryad)F
Anyone can be a museum director, as demonstrated by Moscow businessman-turned-art-collector Igor Markin. His 700-plus-piece collection had outgrown his private properties, so he decided to start a museum where he could display his art and share it with the public. And so art4.ru (‘Art for Russia') was born. Nowadays it operates as more of a gallery, as much of the artwork is also for sale.
MOSCOW MUSEUM OF MODERN ART TVERSKOYMUSEUM
(MMOMA; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mmoma.ru; Tverskoy bul 9; R150; hnoon-8pm; mPushkinskaya)
This small exhibition space, known as the ‘Zurab Gallery', was formerly the studio of sculptor Zurab Tsereteli. As such, the space has seen many talented artists, musicians and writers among its guests. Nowadays it is an offshoot of the main MMOMA outlet on ul Petrovka, and continues to host exhibitions, performances and cultural events. Be sure to check the website to see what’s on, as the museum often closes between shows.
MUSEUM OF ORIENTAL ARTMUSEUM
(Музей искусства народов востока MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-691 0212; www.orientmuseum.ru; Nikitsky bul 12a; R400; h11am-8pm Tue-Sun; mArbatskaya)
This impressive museum on the Boulevard Ring holds three floors of exhibits spanning the Asian continent. Of particular interest is the 1st floor, dedicated mostly to the Caucasus, Central Asia and North Asia (meaning the Russian republics of Cukotka, Yakutia and Priamurie). Several rooms on the 2nd floor are dedicated to Nikolai Rerikh, the Russian artist and explorer who spent several years travelling and painting in Asia.
The entire continent is pretty well represented here, including the countries that were not part of the Russian or Soviet empires. The collection covers an equally vast time period, from ancient times through to the 20th century, including painting, sculpture and folk art.
GOGOL HOUSEMUSEUM
(Дом Гоголя MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.domgogolya.ru; Nikitsky bul 7; R150; hnoon-7pm Tue, Wed & Fri, 2-9pm Thu, noon-5pm Sat & Sun; mArbatskaya)
The 19th-century writer Nikolai Gogol spent his final tortured months here. The rooms – now a small but captivating museum – are arranged as they were when Gogol lived in them. You can even see the fireplace where he famously threw his manuscript of Dead Souls.
An additional reading room contains a library of Gogol’s work and other reference materials about the author. The quiet courtyard contains a statue of the emaciated, sad author surrounded by some of his better-known characters in bas-relief.
CHURCH OF THE GRAND ASCENSIONCHURCH
(Храм Большое Вознесение у Никитских Ворот MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://bolshoevoznesenie.ru; pl Nikitskie Vorota; h8am-6pm)
In 1831 poet Alexander Pushkin married artist Natalia Goncharova in the elegant Church of the Grand Ascension, on the western side of pl Nikitskie Vorota. Six years later he died in St Petersburg, defending her honour in a duel. Such passion, such romance… The celebrated couple is featured in the Rotunda Fountain, erected in 1999 to commemorate the poet’s 100th birthday.
RYABUSHINSKY MANSIONMUSEUM
(Особняк Рябушинского MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Malaya Nikitskaya ul 6/2; adult/student R400/150; h11am-5.30pm Wed-Sun; mPushkinskaya)
Also known as the Gorky House-Museum, this fascinating 1906 art nouveau mansion was designed by architect Fyodor Shekhtel and gifted to celebrated author Maxim Gorky in 1931. The house is a visual fantasy with sculpted doorways, ceiling murals, stained glass, a carved stone staircase and exterior tilework. Besides the fantastic decor it contains many of Gorky’s personal items, including his extensive library.
SYNAGOGUE ON BOLSHAYA BRONNAYASYNAGOGUE
(Синагога на Большой Бронной MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshaya Bronnaya ul 6; mPushkinskaya)
Built in 1883, the Synagogue on Bolshaya Bronnaya was the private place of worship of a prerevolutionary millionaire. Closed in the 1930s, the building was still used for informal gatherings by the Jewish community throughout the Soviet period. Today it is a working synagogue, as well as a social centre for the small but growing Jewish community in Moscow.
PATRIARCH’S PONDSPARK
(Патриаршие пруды MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshoy Patriarshy per; mMayakovskaya)
Patriarch’s Ponds hark back to Soviet days, when the parks were populated with children and babushky. Today you’ll see grandmothers pushing strollers and lovers kissing on park benches. In summer, children romp on the swings, while winter sees them ice skating on the pond. The small park has a huge statue of 19th-century Russian writer Ivan Krylov, known to Russian children for his didactic tales.
Patriarch’s Ponds were immortalised by writer Mikhail Bulgakov, who had the devil appear here in The Master and Margarita. The initial paragraph of the novel describes the area to the north of the pond, where the devil enters the scene and predicts the rapid death of Berlioz. Contrary to Bulgakov’s tale, a tram line never ran along the pond. Bulgakov’s flat, where he wrote the novel and lived up until his death, is around the corner on the Garden Ring.
oMIKHAIL BULGAKOV MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей Михаила Булгакова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.bulgakovmuseum.ru; Bolshaya Sadovaya ul 10; adult/child R150/50; hnoon-7pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun, 2-9pm Thu; mMayakovskaya)
Author of The Master and Margarita and Heart of a Dog, Mikhail Bulgakov was a Soviet-era novelist who was labelled a counter-revolutionary and censored throughout his life. His most celebrated novels were published posthumously, earning him a sort of cult following in the late Soviet period. Bulgakov lived with his wife, Tatyana Lappa, in a flat in this block, which now houses an arts centre and theatre on the ground floor, and a small museum in their actual flat.
Back in the 1990s the empty Bulgakov flat was a hang-out for dissidents and hooligans, who painted graffiti and wrote poetry on the walls. Nowadays, this tradition continues and you can add your own contribution to the historic scrawlings. Inside the flat, you'll find some of the author's personal items, as well as posters and illustrations of his works. More interesting are the readings and concerts that are held here, as well as the offbeat tours on offer. A black cat hangs out in the courtyard.
CENTRAL HOUSE OF WRITERS (CDL)NOTABLE BUILDING
(Центральный дом литераторов (ЦДЛ) MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.moscowwriters.ru; Povarskaya ul 50; mBarrikadnaya)
The Central House of Writers is an elaborate art nouveau mansion dating to 1889. The historic mansion housed the administrative offices of the writers' union for most of the Soviet period. As such, it was featured in Mikhail Bulgakov's famous novel The Master and Margarita.
The on-site restaurant is worth a peek for its ornate interior. Otherwise, the building is not open to the public.
CHEKHOV HOUSE-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Дом-музей Чехова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.goslitmuz.ru; Sadovaya-Kudrinskaya ul 6; R150; h11am-6pm Tue-Sun, to 9pm Wed & Thu; mBarrikadnaya)
‘The colour of the house is liberal, ie red', playwright Anton Chekhov wrote of his house on the Garden Ring, where he lived from 1886 to 1890. The red house now contains the Chekhov House-Museum, with bedrooms, drawing room and study all intact.
The overall impression of Chekhov's home is one of a peaceful and cultured family life. The walls are decorated with paintings that were given to Chekhov by painter Isaac Levitan and art nouveau architect Fyodor Shekhtel, who often visited him here. Photographs depict the playwright with literary greats Leo Tolstoy and Maxim Gorky. One room is dedicated to Chekhov’s time in Melikhovo, showing photographs and manuscripts from his country estate.
2Neighbourhood Walk
Presnya

START PUSHKINSKAYA PL
END KRASNOPRESNENSKAYA NAB
LENGTH 4KM; TWO HOURS
Walk from the previous century into the present (and beyond). From Pushkinskaya pl, stroll south along 1Tverskoy bulvar. This is the loveliest stretch of the Boulevard Ring, lined with grand architecture, colourful blooms and a statue of poet Sergei Yesenin. At the end, sneak a peek at 2Ryabushinsky Mansion, an art nouveau beauty where celebrated social-realist author Maxim Gorky lived.
Looming over the busy intersection, the 3Church of the Grand Ascension hosted the wedding of poet Alexander Pushkin and artist Natalia Goncharova, and a sculpture of the lovebirds graces the fountain out front. Turn right and walk west on Bolshaya Nikitskaya ul, which is studded with mansions. Some of the most striking include the elaborate facade at 4No 51 and the tiled edifice of 5Lopatina Building at No 54.
At the end of Bolshaya Nikitskaya ul, use the underground crosswalk to reach 6Kudrinskaya pl, dominated by a massive skyscraper (one of Stalin’s 'Seven Sisters'). Just south is one of Moscow’s last and best examples of modernist architecture, 7Narkomfin. The constructivist building underwent much-needed restoration in 2017.
Turn right onto Bolshoy Devyatinsky per, then left onto Konyushkovskaya ul, continuing south to Krasnopresnenskaya nab. On the banks of the Moscow River is the massive facade of the 8White House, home of the Russian parliament and site of several decisive historic events in the 1990s. The 9Radisson Royal, another of the 'Seven Sisters', stands on the opposite side of the river.
In the distance, the aInternational Business Centre sprouts up along the Moscow River. Note the double-pronged City of Capitals building, representing Moscow and St Petersburg. The tallest building in Europe, the eastern spire of the Federation Tower, looms some 374m above the city.
Turn right on Nikolaeva ul and duck into the Tryokhgornaya Manufaktura complex. The former textile factory has been converted into a hub for eating, entertainment and design, so finish your tour at one of the many restaurants, bars and cafes on-site.

KUDRINSKAYA APARTMENT BLOCKNOTABLE BUILDING
(Высотка на Кудринской площади MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Kudrinskaya pl 1; mBarrikadnaya)
The 160m, 22-storey Stalinist skyscraper at Kudrinskaya pl contains elite apartments, mostly occupied by pre-eminent cultural figures during Soviet times.
NARKOMFINNOTABLE BUILDING
(Наркомфин MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Novinsky bul 25; mBarrikadnaya)
The model for Le Corbusier’s Unité d’Habitation design principle, this architectural landmark was an early experiment in semicommunal living. Designed and built in the 1920s by Moisei Ginzburg and Ignatii Milinis, Narkomfin offered housing for members of the Commissariat of Finances. In line with constructivist ideals, communal space is maximised and individual space is minimised. Apartments have minute kitchens (or none at all) to encourage residents to eat in the communal dining room. Tours are available through Moscow ArchiGeek.
Having been in a semiruinous state for many years, Narkomfin is finally slated for restoration – a three-year project that began in late 2017. The architect overseeing the project is Alexey Ginzburg, grandson of the original architect, who intends to preserve and restore as much of the constructivist detail as possible. The apartments are likely to remain in private hands but the communal block is expected to house a cultural centre and museum that will hopefully be open to the public.
MOSCOW ZOOZOO
(Московский зоопарк MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.moscowzoo.ru; Bolshaya Gruzinskaya ul 1; R500; h10am-8pm Tue-Sun Apr-Sep, to 5pm Oct-Mar; c; mBarrikadnaya)
Renovations in honour of the zoo's 150th anniversary are ongoing, but the place should be in great shape in coming years. Huge flocks of feathered friends populate the central ponds, making for a pleasant stroll for birdwatchers. For a new perspective on Moscow’s nightlife, check out the nocturnal animal exhibit. Other highlights include the big cats (featuring Siberian tigers) and the polar bears. For more four-legged fun, follow the footbridge to see exhibits featuring animals from each continent.
TSERETELI STUDIO-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей-мастерская Зураба Церетели MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mmoma.ru; Bolshaya Gruzinskaya ul 15; adult/child R250/150; hnoon-8pm Fri-Wed, 1-9pm Thu; c; mBelorusskaya)
Moscow’s most prolific artist has opened up his ‘studio’ as a space to exhibit his many masterpieces. You can’t miss this place – whimsical characters adorn the front lawn. They give just a tiny hint of what’s inside: a courtyard crammed with bigger-than-life bronze beauties and elaborate enamelwork.
The highlight work is undoubtedly Putin in his judo costume, although the huge tile Moscow cityscapes are impressive. You’ll also recognise some smaller-scale models of monuments that appear around town. Indoors, there are three floors of the master’s sketches, paintings and enamel arts.
MUSEUM OF RUSSIAN IMPRESSIONISMMUSEUM
( GOOGLE MAP ; www.rusimp.su; Bldg 11, Leningradsky pr 15; R250; h11am-8pm Fri-Tue, noon-9pm Wed-Thu; mBelorusskaya)
Few Russian artists embraced the Impressionist moniker, but many were influenced by the movement's style and techniques. At Moscow's newest art museum, billionaire art collector Boris Mint aims to educate and impress Muscovites (and visitors) about this important niche, at the same time showcasing his own collection, which includes works by the likes of Valentin Serov, Boris Kustodiev and Konstantin Korovin. The museum occupies part of the former Bolshevik chocolate factory – the sugar silo, to be exact. Sweet!
WHITE HOUSENOTABLE BUILDING
(Белый дом MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Krasnopresnenskaya nab 2; mKrasnopresnenskaya)
The White House – officially the House of Government of the Russian Federation – fronts a stately bend in the Moscow River, just north of the Novoarbatsky most.
It was here that Boris Yeltsin rallied the opposition that confounded the 1991 hard-line coup, then two years later sent in tanks and troops to blast out conservative rivals. The images of Yeltsin climbing on a tank in front of the White House in 1991, and of the same building ablaze after the 1993 assault, are among the most unforgettable from those tumultuous years.
MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CENTREAREA
(Москва-сити GOOGLE MAP ; mDelovoi Tsentr)
This strip along the Moscow River is the site of one of the capital’s largest ongoing urban projects, also known as 'Moscow City'. Here, skyscrapers of glass and steel tower 20 storeys over the rest of the city, shining like beacons to Moscow’s wheeler-dealers and fortune-seekers. The 93-storey Tower East (Vostok) of the Federation complex is the tallest building in both Russia and Europe.

TOP SIGHT
MOSCOW PLANETARIUM
The Moscow Planetarium has become one of the biggest and brightest stars on the capital's museum circuit, now incorporating all kinds of high-tech gadgetry, interactive exhibits and educational programs.
The centrepiece is the Large Star Hall, with its 25m silver dome roof, a landmark which is visible from the Garden Ring. With the starry sky projected across the dome, the shows take viewers on a journey around the world and around the universe. Your ticket includes access to the old-school exhibits in the Urania Museum (think meteorite collection). From May to October, you can also explore the rooftop Sky Park sprinkled with astronomical instruments from sun dials to solar panels.
In addition to the traditional planetary attractions, the facility includes the innovative interactive Lunarium, where visitors can perform experiments. Fun hands-on activities include generating electrical energy, riding a cosmic bicycle and determining your weight on another planet. Another favourite attraction is the four-dimensional cinema, which features 3D images plus other special sensual effects such as sounds, smells and movement.

In particular, the streets around Patriarch's Ponds are crowded with trendy cafes and sophisticated restaurants, many showing off truly creative cooking by internationally renowned chefs. Other noteworthy dining destinations include Bolshaya Nikitskaya ul (inside the Boulevard Ring) and Bolshaya Gruzinskaya ul (near Tverskaya ul).

The queue often runs out the door, as loyal patrons wait their turn for the city’s best freshly baked breads, pastries and pies. It’s worth the wait, especially if you decide on a fruit-filled croissant or to-die-for olive bread. Next door there are big wooden tables where you can get large bowls of coffee or tea.

Tucked into a cosy basement crowded with comfy tables, this inviting little hovel makes it easy to sample fresh Russian soups and salads, as well as more exotic fare from the wok.

An excellent breakfast choice before visiting the Kremlin, this round-the-clock place mixes Soviet nostalgia with a great deal of mischievous irony in both design and food. The chef has upgraded the menu of a standard pioneer camp’s canteen to near-haute-cuisine level, with masterfully cooked porridge, pancakes, vareniki (boiled dumplings, like ravioli) and cottage-cheese pies.
Dr Zhivago occupies the premises of the historic Cafe Berlin inside the Hotel National.

If you want to impress your date, but you can’t afford the Cafe Pushkin for dinner, head next door to the konditerskaya (confectioner) for dessert.

If you wanted to go to Disney World, but somehow ended up in Moscow, Turandot should top your dining list. Musicians costumed in wigs and gowns play chamber music while servers scuttle to and fro. Turandot is named for a Puccini opera set in old Peking, which is as good a reason as any to serve Chinese and Japanese food.
The baroque interior is unbelievably extravagant, with hand-painted furniture, gilded light fixtures and a frescoed cupola ceiling.

The entire menu at Stolle is excellent, but the pirozhki (savoury pies) are irresistible. A ‘stolle’ is a traditional Saxon Christmas cake: the selection of sweets and savouries sits on the counter, fresh from the oven. It may be difficult to decide (mushroom or meat, apricot or apple?), but you really can’t go wrong.

The coffee is good but the pastries are even better. Whether you’re hankering for something savoury or sweet, you’re sure to find it in the big glass display case. Late in the day, everything goes on sale so the bakers can start afresh the following morning.
DOBAVKARUSSIAN€
(Добавка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bldg 1, Rochdelskaya ul 15; mains R200-500; h8am-10pm; v)
Tucked into the corner of the Tryokhgornaya complex, this Soviet-style throwback is a popular spot for breakfast and lunch for local workers. Smiling, kerchief-clad devushki serve up hearty portions of Russian food, with plenty of concessions to modern tastes (including fresh-fruit smoothies and other healthy choices).

This aptly named restaurant takes the most appetising element of Russian food to new heights, offering some 44 varieties of soup, including meat- and fish-based, as well as vegetarian.

Nowadays, there are burger joints on every block in Moscow. But this place was one of the first, and it's still one of the best. These babies feature high-quality ground beef, grilled the way you like it and served with a variety of intriguing toppings. Despite the restaurant's name, there's also pizza and other options on the menu.

Both fashionable and affordable, Botanica offers light, modern fare, with plenty of soups, salads and grills (as well as sushi, spring rolls and noodle dishes). Wood furniture and subtle floral prints complement the garden-themed decor, all of which makes for an enjoyable, all-natural eating experience.

AQ stands for Adrian Quetglas, the Argentinian chef who is the brains behind this creative endeavour. With huge windows and stressed-wood details, the shabby-chic interior is a perfect setting for the eclectic menu. Look for Moroccan chicken with couscous, grilled squid with romesco sauce and other unexpected delicacies.

If you feel the need to get back to nature, this restaurant has recreated a Ukrainian peasant farm in central Moscow. The house speciality is vareniki (boiled dumplings), which are superb, as are other Ukrainian specialities such as borscht and salo (lard). The place has been redone in a pared-down, contemporary style, which is an odd contrast with the farm.

Given Moscow's climate and intensity, emulating the super-relaxed ambience of a genuine Greek taverna is out of the question. So, thankfully, the owners of this restaurant never tried that, but instead they created a very modern Greek-themed place that serves taverna staples – tzatziki, fava, grilled octopus – transformed by 21st-century culinary wizards. Greek expats abound – a sure sign of success!

The original Correa’s occupies a tiny space and there are only a handful of tables. But the large windows and open kitchen guarantee it does not feel cramped, just cosy. The menu – salads, sandwiches, pizza and grills – features nothing too fancy, but everything is prepared with the freshest ingredients and the utmost care. A popular lunch spot.

The ultimate in family-friendly, this place is designed for dads and kids (and mums, too). The play area is well equipped with air hockey, a ball pit and even a drumming room – plenty for kids to do while parents enjoy some downtime. The food and drinks are nothing extraordinary, but reliably good, with the right mix of kids' and grown-up fare.
TRYOKHGORNAYA MANUFAKTURA

Tryokhgornaya Manufaktura (Трёхгорная Мануфактура) is one of the oldest textile factories in Russia, founded in 1799 on the banks of the Moscow River. The factory played a key role in the development of the Presnya district. Over the years, it has employed hundreds of thousands of mill workers, weavers and designers. The company survived both Wars of the Fatherland (War of 1812 and WWII), as well as the uprisings of 1905, which took place at its doorstep. It has survived both nationalisation and privatisation – and is now learning to survive capitalism.
Although the company continues to design and produce fabrics, the level of production has dropped dramatically since its peak in the early 1980s. Meanwhile, the administration of Moscow has been actively moving industry out of the historic city centre. (Never mind that Tryokhgornaya is part of the history of this city centre; it too must go.)
Most of the company's production has already moved to Yaroslavl, but the design centre and administrative offices continue to operate in the original location. In that vein, many of its warehouses have been converted into studios and showrooms, especially for interior design. You can also check out the Tryokhgornaya product line at the on-site Factory Outlet.
Like other repurposed industrial zones, Tryokhgornaya has become a hotspot for nightlife, as restaurants and clubs such as Jagger and Nikuda ne edem take advantage of the prime location and vast postindustrial spaces.
6DRINKING & NIGHTLIFE

Presnya is more about dining than drinking; but of course, you can't have one without the other, which means there are plenty of cool places to drink coffee, sip cocktails or quaff a cold beer. Hotspots are clustered around Patriarch's Ponds and around Tryokhgornaya Manufaktura.

BAR KLAVABAR

The chic interior and intimate atmosphere make for a sophisticated little bar that's trendy but not pretentious. The menu features a full page of whiskies and some enticing house cocktails. It's an expensive place to drink, if that's your activity for the evening, but a perfectly pleasant place to pop in for a sip before or after your night out.

KVARTIRA 44BAR

Somebody had the brilliant idea to convert an old Moscow apartment into a crowded, cosy bar, with tables and chairs tucked into every nook and cranny, and jazz and piano music on Friday and Saturday nights.
MAYAKBAR
(Маяк MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.clubmayak.ru; Bolshaya Nikitskaya ul 19; business lunch R270, mains R300-350; hnoon-6am; W; mOkhotny Ryad)
Named for the Mayakovsky Theatre downstairs, this is a remake of a much-beloved club that operated in this spot throughout the 1990s. The reincarnated version is more pub than club, exuding the air of a welcoming, old-fashioned inn. But it still attracts actors, artists and writers, who come to see friendly faces and let loose in the wee hours.
The bar also serves affordable, filling food.
RYUMOCHNAYABAR
(Рюмочная MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshaya Nikitskaya ul 22/2; meals R200-400; h11am-11pm; mOkhotny Ryad)
A holdover (or a comeback?) from the days when a drinking establishment needed no special name. The ryumochnaya was the generic place where comrades stopped on their way to or from work to toss back a shot or two before continuing on their way. This particular version also offers some tasty food to accompany your sto grammov (100 grams).

(Крафт Нуар MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/craftnoirpub; Bldg 2, Sadovaya-Kudrinskaya ul 32; h2pm-midnight Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri & Sat; W; mMayakovskaya)
Enter from the back courtyard, and climb the graffiti-scrawled staircase to the 2nd floor to find this hole-in-the-wall craft-beer paradise. There's not much to this place, except for 20 different craft beers (mostly Russian) on tap and 100 more in the bottle. The place is pretty unassuming, though you can't get away from the TV screens.

On the upper floors of the throwback Peking Hotel, this trendy bar is nothing but 'now'. That includes the bartenders sporting plaid and their delicious concoctions, specially created for different times of the day. The decor is pretty impressive – particularly the spectacular city skyline view. A perfect place for sundowners (or sun-ups, if you last that long).

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.jaggercity.ru; Bldg 30, Rochdelskaya ul 15; hnoon-midnight Mon-Wed, to 6am Thu-Sat, 2pm-midnight Sun; mUlitsa 1905 Goda)
Tucked into the courtyard in the old Tryokhgornaya manufacturing complex, Jagger is a super-hot bar with a super-cool vibe. Excellent cocktails, sharp clientele and laid-back atmosphere are characteristic of a new Moscow nightlife that is cosmopolitan and cultured, not over-the-top outrageous. Still, you have to know where to look for this place. And you have to look good.
Enter from ul 1905 goda and head to the inner courtyard. Reservations (and table deposit) are essential on weekends.
ZOO BEER & GRILLCRAFT BEER

Here's a place for animal-lovers and beer-lovers. Ten craft beers on tap (including one house brew) and dozens more in bottles accompany an excellent, meat-heavy menu. The slick, postindustrial decor gives a few artistic nods to the animal friends from across the street. If you're hoping to sneak a peek, there's a view into the zoo from the rooftop terrace.
NIKUDA NE EDEMCOCKTAIL BAR

This split-level gastropub also has a sort of split personality, with cosy living-room decor in one area and a slick back-lit bar in another. The overall effect is one that is cool but casual, sophisticated but sympathetic. There is an eclectic menu of food to complement the very creative cocktails.
The place is disguised as an innocuous office, staffed by a pleasant receptionist who will ask My kudo-to edem? (Are we going somewhere?) when you enter. If you answer correctly, the shelves and bookcases will magically open, inviting you into the enticing interior. In case you haven't guessed already, the correct answer is Nikuda ne edem (We go nowhere).
DISCO ROOMSCLUB

'Retro' has become very popular in Moscow, but this is the first place hearkening back to the boogie nights of the 1970s. Out front is an old-fashioned diner where you can fuel up on burgers and breakfast food. Slip through the curtains to the dance floor, illuminated by sparkling disco ball and crowded with dancers doing the Hustle (or not).
RADIO CITYBAR

On the ground floor of the Peking Hotel, this is not the most interesting or original bar in Moscow but it has a few things going for it. Twenty-six, to be exact. That’s the number of TV screens strewn about the bar (22 plasmas, four big screens), all of which are usually tuned into one sporting match or another.
Other than that, the place has 10 kinds of beer on tap and a menu of munchies that gets mixed reviews. There's also live entertainment starting at 8pm from Wednesday to Sunday.

This little cultural centre occupies the ground floor of the building where novelist Mikhail Bulgakov resided. The author lived in a communal flat, no 50, which now houses the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum. After your museum visit, it's worth stopping by here to see the atmospheric cafe and check out the cultural offerings and a few additional exhibits.

But next season, her little shop in the elegant Patriarch's Ponds area might be displaying something entirely different.
ARMIYA ROSSIICLOTHING

In case you hadn't noticed the increasing militarisation of Russian society, here's an example: the Russian Army now has its own fashion line. There's plenty of camouflage here (for men and women) but much of the clothing is surprisingly tasteful. The telltale striped-star logo is as discreet as you want it to be.

Arbat & Khamovniki


Neighbourhood Top Five
1Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts Perusing the collections of the museum's three branches, especially the incredible array of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art in the 19th and 20th Century Art Gallery.
2Novodevichy Convent Soaking up five centuries of artistry and history and paying respects to Russian cultural greats at the adjacent cemetery.
3Varenichnaya No 1 Eating the Soviet-throwback way (dumplings at Cold War–era prices) after strolling and shopping on ul Arbat.
4Cathedral of Christ the Saviour Marvelling at the ostentation and sheer size of the capital's largest church.
5Park Pobedy Recalling WWII, Russia’s greatest tragedy and triumph of the 20th century, at this huge memorial complex.
Explore Arbat & Khamovniki
These two adjacent districts are an art-lover’s dream. The Arbat district is packed with world-class art museums and smaller artist-dedicated galleries, not to mention the elaborate Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. One might spend an entire day wandering the area, starting at the top-notch Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, then strolling up ul Prechistenka in the afternoon and dropping into various sights along the way.
Evening is also a wonderful time to wander the storied cobblestone streets around the old Arbat, the historic haunt of artists, musicians and street performers. Though Arbat today has been taken over by souvenir stands and is often packed with tourists, it still evokes the free-thinking artistic spirit of yesteryear.
In Khamovniki, the Unesco-recognised Novodevichy Convent and Cemetery is a worthwhile half-day destination – a welcome break from art-gallery row. Further away from the city centre, the roads become wider, the traffic faster and the distances greater. As such, Dorogomilovo and Sparrow Hills are not great for wandering. But it’s worth making a special trip for a few choice destinations, such as Park Pobedy and the forested hillsides of Vorobyovy Gory Nature Preserve.
Local Life
AYandexification In Khamovniki, ul Lva Tolstogo is home to the headquarters of Yandex (the Google of Russia, by some accounts). The company has taken over and transformed this old industrial area. Nowadays. hipsters and computer nerds buzz around on scooters and hang out at the restaurants and cafes in the surrounding streets.
AStudent City The area southwest of Moscow State University (known as Yugozapadnaya, or 'southwest') is the city's academic area, populated by students and other energetic young people.
ARiver Walk Vorobyovy Gory attracts students, families and other active people who walk, run, skate and cycle along the riverside path.
Getting There & Away
AArbat Lines 3 and 4 (dark blue and light blue respectively) run in parallel across the Arbat district. They both have stations called Arbatskaya, with the entrance near Arbatskaya pl; and they both have stations called Smolenskaya, with the entrance near Smolenskaya pl. None of these same-named stations are connected to each other, however, so make sure you know which line you are getting on.
AKhamovniki Line 1 (red) traverses the Khamovniki district, from Kropotkinskaya station at pl Prechistenskie Vorota (near the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour); to Park Kultury station along the Garden Ring; and to Sportivnaya station in the southwestern corner (near Novodevichy).
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
All of the neighbourhood art museums stay open late on Thursdays (till 9pm), but beware that ticket sales often stop 30 minutes or even one hour before closing.

NOVODEVICHY CONVENT & CEMETERY
In 1524 Grand Prince Vasily III founded the Novodevichy Convent to celebrate the taking of Smolensk from Lithuania. From early on, the ‘New Maidens’ Convent’ was a place for women from noble families to retire – some more willingly than others.

Walls & Towers
Enter the convent through the red-and-white Moscow-baroque Transfiguration Gate-Church (Преображенская надвратная церковь), built in the north wall between 1687 and 1689. All of these striking walls and towers, along with many other buildings on the grounds, were rebuilt around this time, under the direction of Sofia Alexeyevna. The elaborate bell tower (Колокольня) against the east wall soars 72m over the rest of the monastery. When it was built in 1690 it was one of the tallest towers in Moscow.
Smolensk Cathedral
The centrepiece of the monastery is the white Smolensk Cathedral (Смоленский собор; 1524–25), built to house the precious Our Lady of Smolensk icon. The sumptuous interior is covered in 16th-century frescoes, considered to be among the finest in the city. The gilded iconostasis includes icons that date from the time of Boris Godunov. The icons on the 5th tier are attributed to 17th-century artists Simon Ushakov and Feodor Zubov. The tombs of Sofia Alexeyevna and Eudoxia Lopukhina are in the south nave.
Chambers of Sofia Alexeyevna
Sofia Alexeyevna used the Novodevichy Convent as a residence when she ruled Russia as regent in the 1680s. During her rule, she rebuilt the convent to her liking – which was fortunate, as she was later confined here when her half-brother, Peter the Great, came of age. After being implicated in the Streltsy rebellion, she was imprisoned here for life, primarily inhabiting the Pond Tower (Напрудная башня).
Chambers of Eudoxia Lopukina
Eudoxia Lopukhina, the first wife of Peter the Great, stayed in the Chambers of Eudoxia Lopukhina (Лопухинские Палаты). Although she bore him a son, Peter detested her conservative, demanding personality, and soon rejected her for the beautiful daughter of a Dutch wine merchant. Eudoxia retired to a monastery in Suzdal, where she further estranged herself by taking her own lover and founding an opposition movement within the church. The tsar responded by executing the bishops involved and banishing his former wife to a more remote location. Upon Peter’s death, he was succeeded by Peter II, who recalled his grandmother Eudoxia back to Moscow. She lived out her final years in high style at Novodevichy.
Other Buildings
Other churches include the red-and-white Assumption Church (Успенская церковь), dating from 1685 to 1687, and the 16th-century St Ambrose’s Church (Амвросиевская церковь). Boris Godunov’s sister, Irina, lived in the building adjoining the latter. Today, Irina’s Chambers (Палаты Ирины Годуновой) hold exhibits of religious artwork.
Novodevichy Cemetery
The Novodevichy Cemetery (Новодевичье кладбище MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Luzhnetsky pr 2; h9am-5pm; mSportivnaya) is one of Moscow’s most prestigious resting places – a veritable who’s who of Russian politics and culture. Here you will find the tombs of Rostrovpovich, Bulgakov, Chekhov, Gogol, Mayakovsky, Prokofiev, Stanislavsky and Eisenstein, among many other Russian and Soviet cultural luminaries. The most recent notable addition to the cemetery is former president Boris Yeltsin, who died in 2007. His tomb is marked by an enormous sculpture of a Russian flag, rippling in the wind.
In Soviet times Novodevichy Cemetery was used for eminent people the authorities judged unsuitable for the Kremlin wall, most notably Nikita Khrushchev. The intertwined white-and-black blocks around his bust were intended by sculptor Ernst Neizvestny to represent Khrushchev’s good and bad sides.
The tombstone of Nadezhda Alliluyeva, Stalin’s second wife, is covered by unbreakable glass to prevent vandalism.

DISCRETION ADVISED

Novodevichy is a functioning monastery. Women are advised to cover their heads and shoulders when entering the churches; men should wear long pants.
The Soviets shut down Novodevichy in 1922 and – always ironic – converted it into a Museum of Women’s Emancipation. The nuns were invited to return to the convent in 1994, with services recommencing the following year.

PUSHKIN MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS
This is Moscow’s premier foreign-art museum, split over three branches and showing off a broad selection of European works, including masterpieces from ancient civilisations, the Italian Renaissance and the Dutch Golden Age, not to mention an incredible collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings in the 19th and 20th Century Art Gallery.


dimbar76/shutterstock ©
Main Building
The main building opened in 1912 as the museum of Moscow University. It now exhibits the bulk of the holdings that date from antiquity through to the 18th century.
The excellent Ancient Civilisation exhibits in rooms 1 and 2 contain ancient Egyptian weaponry, jewellery, ritual items and tombstones. Most of the items were excavated from burial sites, including two haunting mummies. Room 3 houses the impressive Treasures of Troy exhibit, with excavated items dating back to 2500 BC.
The highlight of the museum is the selection of Dutch masterpieces from the 17th century, located in rooms 9 through 11. Rembrandt is the star of the show, with many paintings on display, including his moving Portrait of an Old Woman.
The Greek and Italian Courts (rooms 14 and 15) contain examples from the museum’s original collection, which was made up of plaster-cast reproductions of masterpieces from ancient Greece and Rome, as well as from the Renaissance. You’ll find more plaster casts upstairs, including a special room devoted to Michelangelo (room 29).
The 17th and 18th centuries dominate the 2nd floor. Room 17 contains a diverse collection of Italian paintings, including some formidable large-scale canvases. Rooms 21 through 23 are devoted to France, with a separate gallery for the rococo period, featuring some appropriately dreamy paintings by Boucher.
19th & 20th Century Art Gallery
The separate 19th and 20th Century Art Gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.arts-museum.ru; ul Volkhonka 14; adult/student R300/150; h11am-7pm Tue-Sun, to 9pm Thu; mKropotkinskaya) contains a famed assemblage of Impressionist and post-Impressionist works, based on the collections of two well-known Moscow art patrons, Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov.
The Impressionists occupy rooms 10 and 11, with paintings by Degas, Manet, Renoir and Pissarro. Rodin’s sculptures include pieces from the Gates of Hell and the Monument to the Townspeople of Calais. Room 14 is entirely dedicated to Monet.
Rooms 15 to 17 are dedicated to post-Impressionism. Room 15 is almost exclusively Cézanne, featuring his sensuous Bathers. Room 16 contains some lesser-known gems by Van Gogh, including the scorching Red Vineyards and the tragic Prison Courtyard, painted in the last year of his life. Room 17 is devoted to works by Gauguin, representing his prime period.
Upstairs, rooms 19 and 20 display many of the most famous paintings by Matisse, such as Goldfish. There are a few exquisite, primitive paintings by Rousseau in room 21, and some lesser-known pieces by Picasso in room 22.
The final rooms complete the rich collection of 20th-century art, featuring Miró, Kandinsky, Chagall, Arp and others.
Museum of Private Collections
The Museum of Private Collections (Музей личных коллекций MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.artprivatecollections.ru; ul Volkhonka 10; entry prices vary; hnoon-8pm Wed-Sun, to 9pm Thu; mKropotkinskaya) shows off art collections donated by private individuals. The centrepiece is the collection of Ilya Silberstein, the museum’s founder and an accomplished historian of Russian literature and art. This collection is especially rich in pieces by early-20th-century ‘Mir Iskusstva’ artists such as Benois, Serebryakova, Serov and Kustodiev.
Other highlights include the Inna Koretskaya and Boris Mikhailovsky Collection featuring works by Rerikh, Golovin and Kuznetsov; the Lemkul room, with graphic art by Fyodor Lemkul, as well as the artist's collection of glassworks from Russia and Europe; the Sergei Solovyov Collection, with paintings by Perov and Repin; and the impressive collection of Old Believer icons from the 16th to 20th centuries.
The Museum of Private Collections is closed during the construction of the new museum complex, expected to be completed in 2019, and the building is open only for temporary exhibits.

In 2017 the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts commenced a vast expansion and redesign known as 'Museum Town'. The project will revamp the existing museum buildings, connecting them with underground galleries. Exhibition space is expected to double and ul Volkhonka will be transformed into a tree-lined boulevard. The surrounding parkland will host concerts, festivals and public art.
The Museum Town project is supposed to be completed in 2019. In the meantime, the main building and the 19th and 20th Century Art Gallery are open, as usual. The Museum of Private Collections is closed during the construction of the new complex.
Audio guides in English are available for the main building (R350) and the 19th and 20th Century Art Gallery (R300).
A combination ticket (adult/student R550/300) includes admission to both the main building and the 19th and 20th Century Art Gallery

PARK POBEDY AT POKLONNAYA HILL
Magnificent Park Pobedy (Victory Park) at Poklonnaya Hill is a huge memorial complex commemorating the sacrifice and celebrating the triumph of the Great Patriotic War – as WWII is known in Russia. Unveiled on the 50th anniversary of the victory, the park includes endless fountains, monuments and museums, as well as a memorial church, synagogue and mosque.

Obelisk
The park's dominant monument is an enormous obelisk, topped with a sculpture of St George slaying the dragon (the work of contemporary Moscow artist Zurab Tsereteli). Its height is exactly 141.8m, with every 10cm representing one day of the war. At the 60th-anniversary Victory Day celebrations in 2005, President Vladimir Putin unveiled 15 mighty bronze cannons, symbolic of the war's 15 fronts. The ensemble is surrounded by fountains and benches, as well as the sweet Church of St George.
Museum of the Great Patriotic War
The Museum of the Great Patriotic War (Центральный музей Великой Отечественной Войны GOOGLE MAP ; www.poklonnayagora.ru; ul Bratiev Fonchenko 10; adult/child R300/200; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun Nov-Mar, to 8pm Apr-Oct; mPark Pobedy) is the centrepiece of Park Pobedy.
The massive museum has hundreds of exhibits, including dioramas of every major WWII battle the Russians fought in, as well as weapons, photographs, documents and other wartime memorabilia.
The museum building also contains two impressive memorial rooms: the Hall of Glory honours the many heroes of the Soviet Union, while the moving Hall of Remembrance and Sorrow is hung with strings of glass-bead ‘teardrops’ in memory of the fallen.
Exposition of Military Equipment
Tucked into a corner of the vast Park Pobedy, the Exposition of Military Equipment (Площадка боевой техники GOOGLE MAP ; www.poklonnayagora.ru; adult/child R300/200; h11am-6pm Tue-Sun; mPark Pobedy) displays weapons and military equipment from the WWII era. There are plenty of Red Army tanks, armoured cars and self-propelled artillery, not to mention the famous Katyusha rocket launcher. You'll also see train cars, used by the civil engineering unit, fighter planes and naval destroyers.
In addition to the Soviet weaponry, the exhibit includes equipment captured from Germany and Japan, and other equipment that was used by the Allies.
Memorial Synagogue
The Memorial Synagogue at Poklonnaya Hill (Мемориальная синагога на Поклонной горе GOOGLE MAP ; %499-148 1907; www.poklonnaya.ru; Kutuzovsky pr 53; hby appointment; mPark Pobedy) opened in 1998 as a memorial to Holocaust victims, as well as a museum of the Russian Jewry. Admission is with a guide only, so you must make arrangements in advance, especially if you want a tour in English. Not far from the synagogue, a moving sculpture commemorates the victims of the Holocaust.
Borodino Panorama
Park Pobedy is a monument to the Great Patriotic War, but historians find many parallels with the War of 1812, not the least of which is the route taken by attacking and retreating armies. Following the vicious, inconclusive battle at Borodino in August 1812, Moscow’s defenders retreated along what is now Kutuzovsky pr, pursued by Napoleon’s Grand Army. Less than 1km east of Park Pobedy is a museum commemorating this event.
The centrepiece of the museum is the Borodino Panorama (Музей-панорама 'Бородинская битва' GOOGLE MAP ; www.1812panorama.ru; Kutuzovsky pr 38; adult/child R250/100; h10am-6pm Sat-Wed, to 9pm Thu), a pavilion with a giant 360-degree painting of the Borodino battle. Painted by Franz Roubaud, the canvas is 115m around and 15m high. Standing inside this tableau of bloodshed – complete with sound effects – is a powerful way to visualise the event. The museum also contains other artefacts and artwork related to the battle.
In honour of the 200th anniversary of the battle, the museum opened a two-room exhibit dedicated to 'Man & War'. It displays hundreds of items – including paintings, weapons and uniforms, with additional audio-visual effects.

METRO STATION

Check out the artwork in Park Pobedy metro station. Created by the tireless Moscow artist Zurab Tsereteli, the two mosaics depict events from the War of 1812 and the Great Patriotic War, respectively. This station rivals the more central stations for artistry – and it is also the deepest metro station in the city.
Just east of Park Pobedy, the Triumphal Arch ( GOOGLE MAP ; Kutuzovsky pr) celebrates the defeat of Napoleon in 1812. The original arch was demolished at its site in front of the Belorusskaya metro station during the 1930s and reconstructed here in a fit of post-WWII public spirit.

Park Pobedy covers a vast area, so a thorough tour of its monuments, museums and other features entails a lot of walking. Bicycles are available to rent (from R250 per hour).

CATHEDRAL OF CHRIST THE SAVIOUR
Dominating the skyline along Prechistenskaya nab, the gargantuan Cathedral of Christ the Saviour was completed in 1997 – just in time to celebrate Moscow's 850th birthday. It is amazingly opulent, garishly grandiose and truly historic, guaranteeing its role as a love-it-or-hate-it landmark.


Cathedral of Christ the Saviour; dancers on Patriarshy footbridge | pete seaward/lonely planet ©
The contemporary cathedral sits on the site of an earlier and similar church of the same name, built in the 19th century to commemorate Russia’s victory over Napoleon. The original was destroyed in 1931, during Stalin’s orgy of explosive secularism. His plan to replace the church with a 315m-high Palace of Soviets never got off the ground. Instead, for 50 years the site served as the world’s largest swimming pool. An on-site museum details the history of the original church, its destruction and reconstruction.
The central altar of the main church is dedicated to the Nativity, with two side altars dedicated to Sts Nicholas and Alexander Nevsky. Frescoes around the main gallery depict scenes from the War of 1812, while marble plaques remember the participants.
The smaller (but no less stunning) Church of the Transfiguration on the cathedral's ground level contains the venerated icon Christ Not Painted by Hand, by Sorokin, which was miraculously saved from the original cathedral.

START ARBATSKAYA PL

LENGTH 3KM; TWO HOURS
Your stroll down stary Arbat (‘old’ Arbat) starts at traffic-filled Arbatskaya pl. Take note of the 1House of Friendship with Peoples of Foreign Countries, flaunting its incongruous Moorish style.
Strolling up 2ul Arbat, sidewalk art and street performers stand beside souvenir stalls and costumed characters. There are many treasures on display (and for sale) at the 3Association of Artists of the Decorative Arts, where pottery, clothing and handicrafts make for unique souvenirs.
Wander down some of the quiet lanes4, such as 5Starokonyushenny per, which has exemplary art nouveau architectural details. Around the corner on Sivtsev Vrazhek per, look out for strange and beautiful sculptures dotting the yards and courtyards. They are the work of Alexander Burganov, whose nearby 6studio is filled with whimsical treasures.
Get a glimpse of the counterculture of the old Arbat at the corner of Krivoarbatsky per and ul Arbat, where the 7Viktor Tsoy memorial wall is dedicated to the lead singer of the Soviet rock band Kino. Tsoy achieved cult-idol status in 1990 when he died in a car crash at a tragically young age. Further along Krivoarbatsky per, the cylindrical 8Melnikov House is an important constructivist architectural site.
Back on the Arbat, you can’t miss the statue of 9Bulat Okudzhava, the beloved bard who lived and performed on this storied street. Cross and continue north on Spasopeskovsky per. This little lane contains architectural gems such as the lovely 17th-century aChurch of the Saviour in Peski. The handsome neoclassical mansion at No 10 is bSpaso House, famous as the scene of Satan’s ball in Bulgakov’s The Master and Margarita.
Return to the Arbat and the house where Alexander Pushkin and Natalia Goncharova lived after they wed, now holding the cPushkin House-Museum. Continue to Smolenskaya-Sennaya pl – the towering skyscraper that houses the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is one of Stalin’s 'Seven Sisters'.
The Arbat is lined with restaurants and cafes where you can pause for a break along the way. Some of our favourites include Varenichnaya No 1 and Rukkola.

The Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts anchors a neighbourhood that's packed with art museums and galleries. It's not far from the atmospheric old Arbat, making this an exceptional area for strolling and discovering the city's artistic side.

Novodevichy Convent occupies the southern end of the neighbourhood, but it's a long haul to get out here (four metro stops). There are few other attractions in the vicinity.

Park Pobedy is 10km west of Red Square (4km outside the Garden Ring).

ARBAT, MY ARBAT

Arbat, my Arbat, you are my calling. You are my happiness and my misfortune.
– Bulat Okudzhava
For Moscow’s beloved bard Bulat Okudzhava, the Arbat was not only his home, it was his inspiration. Although he spent his university years in Georgia dabbling in harmless verse, it was only upon his return to Moscow – and to his cherished Arbat – that his poetry adopted the free-thinking character for which it is known.
He gradually made the transition from poet to songwriter. While Bulat and his friends enjoyed his songs, composers, singers and guitarists did not, resenting the fact that somebody with no musical training was writing songs. The ill feeling subsided when a well-known poet announced that it was just another way of presenting poetry.
And so a new form of art was born. The 1960s were heady times, in Moscow as elsewhere, and Okudzhava inspired a whole movement of liberal-thinking poets to take their ideas to the streets. Vladimir Vysotsky and others – some political, others not – followed in Okudzhava’s footsteps, their iconoclastic lyrics and simple melodies drawing enthusiastic crowds all around Moscow.
The Arbat today, crowded with tacky souvenir shops and overpriced cafes, bears little resemblance to the hallowed haunt of Okudzhava’s youth. But its memory lives on in the bards and buskers, painters and poets who still perform for strolling crowds on summer evenings.

Personal effects, family portraits, reproductions of notes and handwritten poetry provide insight into the work of the beloved bard. Perhaps the most interesting exhibit is ‘Pushkin and His Time’, which puts the poet in a historical context, demonstrating the influence of the Napoleonic Wars, the Decembrists’ revolt and other historic events.

In addition to its impressive reference library, the museum contains exhibits of manuscripts, letters and artwork focusing on Leo Tolstoy’s literary influences and output. Family photographs, personal correspondence and artwork from the author’s era all provide insight into his work.
This museum undoubtedly contains the largest collection of portraits of the great Russian novelist.

(Церковь Святого Николая в Хамовниках MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Lva Tolstogo 2; mPark Kultury)
This church, commissioned by the weavers’ guild in 1676, is among the most colourful in Moscow. The ornate green-and-orange-tapestry exterior houses an equally exquisite interior, rich in frescoes and icons. Leo Tolstoy, who lived up the street, was a parishioner at St Nicholas, which is featured in his novel Resurrection. Look also for the old white stone house, built in 1689, which housed the office of the weavers’ guild and textile shop (Бывшая ткацкая гильдия; ul Lva Tolstogo 10).
TOLSTOY ESTATE-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей-усадьба Толстого ‘Хамовники’ MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tolstoymuseum.ru; ul Lva Tolstogo 21; adult/student R400/200; h10am-6pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun, noon-8pm Thu; mPark Kultury)
Leo Tolstoy’s winter home during the 1880s and 1890s now houses an interesting museum dedicated to the writer’s home life. While it’s not particularly opulent or large, the building is fitting for junior nobility – which Tolstoy was. Exhibits here demonstrate how Tolstoy lived, as opposed to his literary influences, which are explored at the Tolstoy Literary Museum. See the salon where Sergei Rachmaninov and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov played piano, and the study where Tolstoy wove his epic tales.
RERIKH MUSEUM

Nikolai Rerikh (known internationally as Nicholas Roerich) was a Russian artist from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, whose fantastical artwork is characterised by rich colours, primitive style and mystical themes. He is beloved for his commitment to global harmony, represented by a peace sign of his own design, a pyramid of three solid-red circles. In 1989 Rerikh's son founded a museum to display his father's paintings, as well as personal items and family heirlooms. Housed in the grand 17th-century Lopukhin manor, the Rerikh Museum was operated by the nongovernmental International Centre of Roerichs (ICR).
In recent years, however, the independent Rerikh Museum has felt increasing pressure from state forces, which came in the form of unexpected building inspections, lease revocations and eviction notices. In 2017 the museum was raided by special forces in riot gear, who seized nearly 200 works of art, and the building was locked shut.
State officials claim that the seized property is evidence in a fraud case against Boris Bulochnik, a fallen oligarch who donated the art to the museum. No angel himself, Bulochnik is the former chairman of the now-defunct Master Bank, which earned the title of 'Russia's seediest bank' from one Bloomberg columnist.
At the same time, officials from the Ministry of Culture have indicated that they intend to open a state Rerikh museum on the premises of the Lopukhin estate. Some experts claim that the artwork will be safer in the hands of the state. But the ICR wonders how the state, as it is, can protect the spiritual legacy of mystical, peace-loving Nikolai Rerikh.
WORTH A DETOUR
SPARROW HILLS

Head to the hills south of the city for one of the best views of Moscow. Vorobyovy Gory, or Sparrow Hills, Nature Reserve is the green hilly area (Воробьевы горы GOOGLE MAP ; www.vorobyovy-gory.ru; mVorobyovy Gory) south of the Moscow River, opposite the tip of the Khamovniki peninsula. This wooded hillside is a less developed, less crowded extension of Gorky Park and Neskuchny Garden. The paved path that originates near Gorky Park continues along the river for several kilometres, and bikes and skates are available to rent. Walking trails from the riverbank wind up to Universitetskaya pl for a lookout.
From the square in front of Moscow State University (Московский Государственный Университет; MGU GOOGLE MAP ; Universitetskaya pl; mUniversitet), most of the city spreads out before you. It is an excellent vantage point to see Luzhniki, the huge stadium complex built across the river for the 1980 Olympics, as well as Novodevichy Convent and the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.
Behind Universitetskaya pl is the Stalinist spire of Moscow State University, one of the 'Seven Sisters'. The building is the result of four years of hard labour by convicts between 1949 and 1953. It boasts an amazing 36 floors and 33km of corridors. The shining star that sits atop the spire is supposed to weigh 12 tonnes. Among other socialist-realist frills on the facade, look for the eager students looking forward to communism. The building is not open to the public, which is a shame, because the lobby is equally elaborate, featuring bronze statues of distinguished Soviet scientists.
5EATING

Arbat and Khamovniki do not offer the city's best dining, but visitors will not suffer for lack of choices. Nowadays, there are some excellent eateries in the streets around the museums. Even the old Arbat – long a culinary wasteland – now has a few noteworthy restaurants that merit a trip.

Options are more limited outside the Garden Ring, but ul Lva Tolstogo has emerged as a dining hotspot, with many restaurant openings in recent years.

5Arbat
oVARENICHNAYA NO 1RUSSIAN€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.varenichnaya.ru; ul Arbat 29; business lunch R290-340, mains R220-490; h10am-midnight; vEc; mArbatskaya)
Retro Soviet is all the rage in Moscow, and this old-style restaurant does it right, with books lining the walls, old movies on the B&W TV, and Cold War–era prices. The menu features tasty, filling vareniki and pelmeni (Russian-style dumplings), with sweet and savoury fillings. Bonus: an excellent house-made pickled vegie plate to make you pucker.
LAVKALAVKAMARKET€
(ЛавкаЛавка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.lavkalavka.ru; Bldg 2, Plotnikov per 19/38; mains R200-500; h10am-10pm Mon-Sat, to 8pm Sun; mSmolenskaya)
After taking the Moscow culinary world by storm with its farm-to-table restaurant, LavkaLavka has opened a network of small 'farmer's shops' like this one. Here, patrons can purchase handmade cheese and sausages, pickled vegetables and mushrooms, wild honey and more. A select and ever-changing menu of prepared foods is served at a tiny cafe.
RUKKOLAITALIAN€
(Руккола MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://rucola.com.ru; ul Arbat 19; mains R320-640; h10am-midnight; Wvc; mArbatskaya)
Rukkola offers perfectly crispy, artfully topped thin-crust pizza that you'd be happy to eat in Napoli, let alone Moscow. A stylish interior, friendly service and affordable prices make this a great find. Lounge on comfy couches and watch the pizza chef toss his pies high in the sky; or grab an outdoor seat to watch the action on the Arbat.
BLACK STAR BURGERSBURGERS€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.blackstarburger.ru; ul Novy Arbat 15; burgers R240-777; Wv; mArbatskaya)
Music and burger lovers line up out the door and down the sidewalk for a taste of the burgers being touted by Russian rapper Timati. There's a bit of gimmickry going on here (burgers are served with black gloves so patrons don't get their hands dirty) but most people agree that Timati knows how to make a good patty.
Bonus: three kinds of veggie burgers.
PRIME STARFAST FOOD€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.prime-star.ru; ul Arbat 9; mains R100-200; h8am-11pm; WvE; mArbatskaya)
Stop in for a quick bite along the old Arbat. Enjoy fresh (and healthy!) salads and sandwiches, premade and ready to take out to the outdoor seating.
MOO-MOOCAFETERIA€
(Му-Му MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cafemumu.ru; ul Arbat 45/24; mains R200-300; h10am-11pm; W; mSmolenskaya)
You will recognise this popular cafeteria by its black-and-white Holstein-print decor. The cafeteria-style service offers an easy approach to all the Russian favourites. There are other outlets all over town.
oELARDZHIGEORGIAN€€
(Эларджи MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-627 7897; www.ginza.ru; Gagarinsky per 15a; mains R600-800; hnoon-midnight; Ec; mKropotkinskaya)
Moscow's Georgian restaurants are all very tasty, but this one is also tasteful. You'll be charmed from the moment you enter the courtyard, where live rabbits and lambs greet all comers. Sink into a sofa in the romantic dining room or on the light-filled porch; then feast on delicacies, such as the namesake dish, elarji (cornmeal with suluguni cheese).
BALKONASIAN, ITALIAN€€
(Балкон MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.balkon-restaurant.ru; 7th fl, Novinsky bul 8; mains R500-1000; hnoon-midnight; vE; mSmolenskaya)
On the 7th floor of the Lotte Plaza, this trendy spot has the requisite outdoor terrace (the largest in the city) and superb city views. But it also gives you something to look at right in the dining area: various islands of activity give a glimpse of the preparation of different kinds of food – a ‘gastronomic show'.
GENATSVALE ON ARBATGEORGIAN€€
(Генацвале на Арбате MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-697 9453; www.genatsvale-restoran.ru; Bldg 2, ul Novy Arbat 11; meals R600-1000; hnoon-midnight; Ec; mArbatskaya)
Subtle, it is not. Bedecked with fake trees and flowing fountains, this restaurant conjures up the Caucasian countryside, leaving little to the imagination. But what better setting to feast on favourites such as khachapuri (cheesy bread) and lamb dishes.
VOSTOCHNY KVARTALUZBEK€€
(Восточный квартал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.vkvartal-arbat.ru; ul Arbat 45/24; mains R400-800; hnoon-11pm; vE; mSmolenskaya)
Vostochny Kvartal lives up to its name, acting as the ‘Eastern Quarter’ of the Arbat. Uzbek cooks and plenty of Uzbek patrons are a sign that this is a real-deal place to get your plov, an Uzbek pilaflike dish of meat and rice. Despite the Arbat address, the restaurant is actually on Plotnikov per, behind the Bulat Okudzhava statue.
oCHEMODANRUSSIAN€€€
(Чемодан MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-695 3819; www.chemodan-msk.ru; Gogolevsky bul 25; mains R900-1950; avE; mKropotkinskaya)
A unique opportunity to sample Siberian cuisine (rare, that is, for those of us who don't frequent Siberia). The menu highlights game meat, regional seafood and wild fruits and berries (and pine cones). The dining room is decorated with old photos and antiques, creating a romantic atmosphere that any adventurer would be happy to return home to. Highly recommended.
5Khamovniki
USACHEVSKY MARKETMARKET€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-999-003 0030; www.usachevsky.ru; ul Usachyova 26; mains R200-600; h9am-9pm; mSportivnaya)
An old market has been taken over by hipster foodies, who instantly filled the premises with little eateries serving Georgian, Uzbek, Italian, Israeli and you-name-it cuisine, as well as shops representing small-scale Russian food producers, such as Kostroma Cheese. It’s a great place for lunch and shopping, if you happen to be nearby.
PROFESSOR PUFRUSSIAN€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.professorpuf.ru; Bldg 1, ul Volkhonka 9; breakfast R150-200, lunch R350-500; h8am-10pm Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; WvEc; mKropotkinskaya)
A select menu of Russian classics shows off fresh ingredients, old-fashioned cooking methods and contemporary flare. Pleasant, efficient service and a super-central location make this a great option before or after a morning at the museum. Unfortunately named, but otherwise delightful, especially the house-made bread and pastries.
GOLUBKARUSSIAN€
(Голубка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.golubka-msk.ru; Bolshaya Pirogovskaya ul 53/55; mains R300-500; h9am-11pm; WvEc; mSportivnaya)
Opposite the entrance to Novodevichy Convent is this sweet place where you can snuggle into big armchairs, enjoy the view out the picture windows, and feast on fresh bread, hot soup and other old-fashioned goodness. The menu is mostly Russian cuisine, but includes pasta, sandwiches and other international favourites.
BB&BURGERSBURGERS€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.bbburgers.ru; ul Lva Tolstogo 20; mains R380-480; h11am-10pm; W; mPark Kultury)
If you're wondering what all the Bs stand for, it's 'beer' and 'buns', as well as burgers. The latter is the star of the show, of course, with seven original burger creations (including a tasty mushroom veggie burger) and five additional sandwiches on the menu. Good, quick tasty lunch stop.
VORONEZHSTEAK€€
(Воронеж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-695 0641; www.voronej.com; ul Prechistenka 4; sandwiches R250-750, mains from R580; h8am-midnight; W; mKropotkinskaya)
When Voronezh first opened, foodies couldn't stop talking about how a classy new restaurant in the capital was named after a provincial town. Bold move by esteemed chef Alexander Rapoport. The fact is that Voronezh (the restaurant) is a celebration of meat, and all of this meat comes from the owner's ranch in Voronezh (the city).
The place is set on multiple floors: the ground floor has a butcher shop and a sandwich counter, while the 2nd floor contains the proper, stylish restaurant, serving every cut of meat your carnivorous heart desires.
ZHURFAK CAFERUSSIAN€€
(Кафе Журфак MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-985-212 5050; www.jurfak-cafe.ru; Bolshoy Afanasyevsky per 3; mains R500-800; h9.30am-11pm; W; mKropotkinskaya)
One of our favourite secret spots, this smart cafe is named for the Moscow State University Journalism Faculty, which is located nearby. In summer, there's a shady outside eating area. Otherwise, descend into the comfy basement quarters for lively conversation, traditional food, jazz music (Monday and Wednesday) and a hint of Soviet nostalgia.
TIFLIS DVORIKGEORGIAN€€
(Тифлисский дворик MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tiflis.ru; ul Ostozhenka 32; mains R500-900; E; mKropotkinskaya)
The name of this restaurant comes from the Russian word for the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, and when you enter this restaurant you might think you are there. Its airy balconies and interior courtyards recall a 19th-century Georgian mansion – an atmospheric setting for tasty Georgian fare.
AKADEMIYAITALIAN€€
(Академия MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.semifreddo-group.com; Volkhonka ul 15/17; breakfast R290-530, pizzas R340-650, mains R510-860; h8am-midnight Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; aiW; mKropotkinskaya)
Sip fancy coffee drinks or munch on crispy-crust pizza and watch the world go by. Steps from the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts and the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, this is the perfect place to recover from a day of art and architecture.
BABA MARTABULGARIAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.babamarta.ru; Bldg 2, Gogolevsky bul 8; business lunch R430, mains R490-860; hnoon-11pm; WvEc; mKropotkinskaya)
With its colourful, folksy decor, this basement dining room is an atmospheric spot for filling Balkan food and sweet wine. The excellent-value lunch special makes it a popular option for a midday meal, when service can be harried.
BLACK MARKETAMERICAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.blackmarketcafe.ru; ul Usachyova 2/1; burgers R620-720, mains R560-920, steaks R800-1800; h10am-11pm; aWE; mFrunzenskaya)
Whether you come for the 'burger bar' or the 'meat market', you'll get your protein at this upscale American bar and grill. The preparation of the meat is perfect, down to the fresh, homemade burger rolls. You'll also appreciate the well-stocked bar, super-slick interior and good-looking patrons.
PANE & OLIOITALIAN€€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-246 2622; www.paneolio.ru; ul Timura Frunze 22; pastas R520-920, mains R660-1440; hnoon-11pm; vE; mPark Kultury)
Forgoing the trends that characterise many Moscow restaurants, Pane & Olio is a classic Italian trattoria, offering homemade pasta and fine grilled meats and fish. A chef named Giuseppe makes the rounds to ensure his guests are sated and happy.
GALEREYA KHUDOZHNIKOVFUSION€€€
(Галерея художников MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-637 2866; www.gal-h.ru; ul Prechistenka 19; mains R800-1500; hnoon-midnight; vE; mKropotkinskaya)
This fantastical restaurant next to the Tsereteli Gallery lives up to its name, which means 'Artist Gallery'. The huge, light-filled atrium is wallpapered with stained glass and primitive paintings. The menu is a fusion of European and Asian influences. Though it is secondary to the art, the food is well prepared and, appropriately enough, artistically presented.
WORTH A DETOUR
INDIAN FOOD WITH A VIEW

Darbars ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.darbar.ru; 16th fl, Leninsky pr 38; business lunch R400, meals R600-1000; hnoon-midnight; vE; mLeninsky Prospekt) is a long-standing favourite of spice-loving Muscovites, who are willing to make the trek south of the centre to feast on samosas, dhal and curries. The fancy digs on the 16th floor of the Hotel Sputnik offer wonderful panoramic views. Still a favourite destination for Indian families.
6DRINKING & NIGHTLIFE

There are bars clustered along ul Arbat and ul Novy Arbat, as well as ul Lva Tolstogo in Khamovniki. In other areas, this cultural district might feel a little staid when it comes to nightlife.

6Arbat
BALALAECHNAYACRAFT BEER
(Балалаечная MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.balaykabar.ru; ul Arbat 23; hnoon-midnight; mArbatskaya)
There is nothing too complicated going on here, and that's the beauty of it. Lovely handcrafted balalaikas (traditional Russian stringed instruments) for sale on the wall, and tasty handcrafted beer on tap. Live acoustic music on 'Spiritual Thursdays'.
ZHIGULI BEER HALLBREWERY
(Пивной зал Жигули MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.zhiguli.su; ul Novy Arbat 11; beer R210-350; h10am-2am Sun-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; W; mArbatskaya)
It’s hard to classify this old-style stolovaya (cafeteria) that happens to brew great beer. The place harks back to the Soviet years, when a popular pivnaya (beer joint with stand-up tables) with the same name was a Novy Arbat institution. The minimalist decor and cafeteria-style service recalls the heyday, although it's been updated with big-screen TVs and a separate table-service dining room.
6Khamovniki
DOM 12WINE BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.dom12cafe.ru; Mansurovsky per 12; hnoon-6am; mPark Kultury)
Eclectic and atmospheric, Dom 12 may be the perfect place to attend an event or chat with friends over a glass of wine. The cosy interior is enhanced by natural materials, comfy chairs and low lighting. Besides the excellent wine list, the place offers poetry nights, lectures, concerts and dancing. Delightful!
SOHO ROOMSCLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-988 7474; www.sohorooms.com; Savvinskaya nab 12; hrestaurant from noon Tue-Sat, pool terrace from 9pm Thu-Sat, club from midnight Fri & Sat; mSportivnaya)
Still a hotspot in Moscow, this uber-exclusive nightclub offers dressed-up women, cool music and expensive cocktails. Of course, many clubs in Moscow can boast such things, but only Soho Rooms has a swimming pool and a poolside terrace, too. Face control is tight, so you'd best look sharp.
I LIKE WINEWINE BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.perelmanpeople.com; ul Timura Frunze 11; h10am-midnight Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri & Sat; W; mPark Kultury)
The name choice is truly regrettable (especially with the thumbs-up 'like' symbol). But if you can get past that, this is an inviting and enjoyable place. It is stylish but not pretentious, with exposed brick walls and an expansive outdoor terrace. You'll find dozens of vintages from around the world, with a menu of Mediterranean-style small plates to complement them.
ANDERSONCAFE
(АндерСон MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cafe-anderson.ru; Gagarinsky per 6; desserts R200-400; h9am-11pm Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; W; mKropotkinskaya)
There are a few lunch items on the menu, but this is really a place to come to indulge in rich pastries and sweet drinks. Stuffed animals available to keep you (or your kids) company.
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
THE BRAINS

High up on the top floor of the Russian Academy of Sciences building (fondly known as ‘the Brains’), chic restaurant Sky Lounge ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.skylounge.ru; Fl 22, Leninsky prospekt 29; h1pm-midnight Sun-Wed, to 1am Thu-Sat; mLeninsky Pr) is a sweet spot to go for a sundown drink. Service is variable and food is overpriced, but the city views are unbeatable.

LUZHNIKI STADIUMSPECTATOR SPORT
(Олимпийский Комплекс Лужники MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-780 0808; www.luzhniki.ru; Luzhnetskaya nab 24; mSportivnaya)
This giant stadium (home to football club FC Torpedo) is the capital's largest, seating nearly 81,000 people. The stadium is part of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex, which was the chief venue for the 1980 Summer Olympics. In recent years, it underwent a major upgrade, in preparation for hosting the 2018 World Cup Final.

This huge circus holds 3400 spectators, but the steep pitch means that everyone has a view of the action. The company includes hundreds of performers – mostly acrobats, but some animals too (bears, sea lions, monkeys). It is a great spectacle that is certain to entertain and amaze.
KUKLACHEV CAT THEATRETHEATRE
(Театр кошек Куклачёва GOOGLE MAP ; %495-243 4005; www.kuklachev.ru; Kutuzovsky pr 25; tickets R500-2500; hbox office 11am-7pm; c; mKutuzovskaya)
At this unusual theatre, acrobatic cats do all kinds of stunts for the audience’s delight. Director Yury Kuklachev bristles at the use of the word 'train', claiming that the animals cannot be forced to do anything. Instead, he says, handlers simply 'play' with the cats.
PIONER CINEMACINEMA
(Кинотеатр Пионер GOOGLE MAP ; %499-240 5240; http://pioner-cinema.ru; Kutuzovsky pr 21; mKievskaya)
Almost all of the films shown in Russia are dubbed into the Russian language, but this cinema theatre is a pleasant exception. Apart from sticking with the original language, it screens festival and art-house films that you won't be able to see elsewhere.
RHYTHM BLUES CAFELIVE MUSIC
(Блюз Кафе Ритм MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-697 6008; www.rhythm-blues-cafe.ru; Starovagankovsky per; cover R500-1000; hshows from 7.30pm; mAleksandrovsky Sad)
If your dog got run over by a pick-up truck, you might find some comfort at the Rhythm Blues Cafe, with down-and-out live music every night, plus cold beer and a whole menu of salty cured meats. Great fun and a friendly vibe, with people actually listening to the music. Book a table if you want to sit down.

The retro decor and friendly service create a great vibe at this cool underground music club. There are live jazz performances on Thursday and Sunday, and karaoke on the other nights. Food, wine and cocktails are fairly straightforward but satisfactory. Reservations recommended.
MOSCOW CHILDREN’S MUSICAL THEATRETHEATRE
(Детский Музыкальный театр им. Н.И.Сац GOOGLE MAP ; %495-120 2515; www.teatr-sats.ru; pr Vernadskogo 5; tickets R500-1500; hbox office noon-7pm; c; mUniversitet)
Founded by theatre legend Natalya Sats in 1965, this was the country’s first children’s theatre. Sats, apparently, was the inspiration for Prokofiev’s famous rendition of Peter and the Wolf, which is still among the most popular performances here. But all shows are entertaining and educational, with actors appearing in costume beforehand to talk with the children.
PRACTICAL TIP
FUN FOR KIDS

Russia's rich tradition of theatre and entertainment extends to all segments of the population, even the little people. If you are travelling with children, you are likely to find yourself in the southwest corner of the city, which is home to some of the best options for kids' entertainment, including a huge circus, an acrobatic-cat show and a children's musical theatre.
7SHOPPING

We have to admit that tourist streets and centres are good for souvenir shopping. That is certainly the case on ul Arbat, which is lined with souvenir shops – mostly tacky and overpriced, but there are a few gems along the way.

DOM KNIGIBOOKS
(Дом Книги MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mdk-arbat.ru; ul Novy Arbat 8; h9am-11pm Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; mArbatskaya)
Among the largest bookstores in Moscow, Dom Knigi has a selection of foreign-language books to rival any other shop in the city, not to mention travel guidebooks, maps, and reference and souvenir books. This huge, crowded place hosts regularly scheduled readings, children’s programs and other bibliophilic activities.
RUSSIAN EMBROIDERY & LACEGIFTS & SOUVENIRS
(Русская вышивка и кружево MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Arbat 31; h11am-8pm Mon-Sat, to 5pm Sun; mSmolenskaya)
Considering the lack of flashy signs and kitsch, it would be easy to miss this plain storefront on the Arbat. But inside there are treasures galore, from elegant tablecloths and napkins to delicate handmade sweaters and embroidered shirts.
RUSSKIE CHASOVYE TRADITSIIJEWELLERY
(Русские часовые традиции MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.smirs.com; ul Arbat 11; h10am-9pm; mArbatskaya)
If you're in the market for a fancy timepiece, pop into the Arbat outlet of ‘Russian Watch Traditions’. On this touristy drag, these small shops carry exclusively Russian brands, including Aviator, Buran, Vostok, Poljot, Romanoff and Denissov.
ASSOCIATION OF ARTISTS OF THE DECORATIVE ARTSGIFTS & SOUVENIRS
(Ассоциация художников декоративно-прикладного искусства; AHDI MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.ahdi.ru; ul Arbat 21; h11am-8pm; mArbatskaya)
Look for the ceramic number plate and the small sign indicating the entrance to this 'exposition hall', which is actually a cluster of small shops, each showcasing arts and crafts by local artists. In addition to paintings and pottery, the most intriguing items are the gorgeous knit sweaters, woolly coats and embroidered dresses – all handmade and unique.
BURO NAHODOKART
(Бюро находок MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.buro-nahodok.ru; Smolensky bul 7/9; h10am-9pm; mPark Kultury)S
In 2003 three Moscow artists opened this shop to sell their fun and funky gifts and souvenirs. You'll find quirky knick-knacks, clothing and home decor, most exhibiting more than a hint of irony.
VASSA & COFASHION & ACCESSORIES
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.vassatrend.com; Nikitsky bul 5/1; h10am-9pm Mon-Sat, noon-8pm Sun; mArbatskaya)
Elena Vassa is a Russian designer but was trained in New York City. Her designs reflect a classical and classy sense of style. Catering to modern Moscow men and women, Vassa offers suits, shirts, skirts, dresses and other professional clothing that stylish folks might wear at the office or out on the town.
ARTEFACT GALLERY CENTREART
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Prechistenka 30; h10am-6pm, individual gallery hours vary; mKropotkinskaya)
Near the Russian Academy of Arts, the Artefact Gallery Centre is a sort of art mall, housing a few dozen galleries under one roof. Look for paintings, sculptures, dolls, pottery and other kinds of art that people actually buy, as opposed to the more avant-garde exhibits at other art centres.
CHAPURIN BOUTIQUEFASHION & ACCESSORIES
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.chapurin.com; Savvinskaya nab 21; h10am-10pm; mSportivnaya)
Fashion maven Igor Chapurin got his start designing theatre costumes, but his creativity knows no bounds: in addition to men’s and women’s clothing, he has lines of children’s clothing and sportswear. Rich fabrics, playful textures and solid colours.

Explore Zamoskvorechie
Novokuznetskaya and Tretyakovskaya metro stations provide the best access to the core parts of Zamoskvorechie. Alternatively, a scenic way to access the area is by walking across one of two bridges on both sides of the Kremlin or the pedestrian bridge near the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, accessed via Kropotkinskaya metro station.
The core of Zamoskvorechie is squeezed between ul Pyatnitskaya and ul Bolshaya Polyanka, with the district's crown gem – the Tretyakov Gallery – positioned in the very middle. To soak up the ambience and admire some beautiful churches, walk south along ul Bolshaya Ordynka, venturing into small lanes that connect it to busier parallel streets.
North of the Tretyakov Gallery, a pedestrian bridge across the canal connects historical Zamoskvorechie with Bolotny Island, home to the fledgling hipster cluster of Red October. The latter serves as a starting point for exploring a chain of beautifully renovated parks filled with modern art spaces, cool eateries and sport facilities.
Travelling south along the grey and green metro lines, you can explore several important fortified monasteries and palaces, stopping for a meal at the gourmet paradise of Danilovsky Market.
You'll need at least a full day to explore the core of Zamoskvorechie and the riverside parks. Outlying sights require additional time.
Local Life
AEating at the market A vestige of the Soviet era, the Danilovsky Market has jumped on the wave of gentrification and is now filled to the brim with little eateries representing all imaginable (and barely imaginable) cuisines. It is a trek from the centre but it’s worth it.
AOutdoor activities Closed to vehicles, but welcoming cyclists, rollerbladers and pedestrians, Moscow's answer to London's South Bank stretches 8km from Red October to Vorobyovy Gory via Gorky Park, which offers a zillion activities from pétanque to dancing.
AGorging on art Muscovites' hunger for artistic education manifests itself in weekend crowds pouring into Zamoskvorechie's large and famous galleries, especially when new and highly publicised exhibitions are under way.
APub crawling The area between Tretyakovskaya and Novokuznetskaya metro stations is dotted with bars and craft-beer pubs. The newly widened pavements encourage outdoor drinking in warm months.
Getting There & Away
AInner Zamoskvorechie Three different metro lines cut through Zamoskvorechie in a north–south direction. The green Zamoskvoretskaya line and the orange Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya line intersect at Novokuznetskaya. The grey Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya line has a station at Polyanka.
AOuter Zamoskvorechie Along the Ring line, the green Zamoskvoretskaya line stops at Paveletskaya; the orange Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya line stops at Oktyabrskaya; and the grey Serpukhovsko-Timiryazevskaya line stops at Serpukhovskaya.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
The northern part of Zamoskvorechie – including the Red October complex on Bolotny Island – is easiest to access by walking over the Bolshoy Moskvoretsky most (bridge) from the Kremlin or walking over the Patriarshy most from the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.

STATE TRETYAKOV GALLERY
The exotic boyar castle on a little lane in Zamoskvorechie contains the world’s best collection of Russian icons and an outstanding collection of other prerevolutionary Russian art. The building was designed by Viktor Vasnetsov between 1900 and 1905. The gallery started as the private collection of the 19th-century industrialist brothers Pavel and Sergei Tretyakov.


popova valeriya/shutterstock ©
The Collection
The tour of the gallery begins on the 2nd floor, where 18th- to 20th-century artists are exhibited. On the 1st floor, visitors are treated to more fin-de-siècle art before finding themselves surrounded by medieval icons.
2nd Floor
Rooms 1 through 7 display paintings and sculpture from the 18th century, including many portraits and commissioned paintings. Things get more interesting in rooms 8 through 15, which display landscapes, character paintings and portraits from the 19th century.
The real gems of the collection, however, start in room 16. In the 1870s, daring artists started to use their medium to address social issues, thus founding the Peredvizhniki (Wanderers) movement.
Room 17 is dedicated to Vasily Perov, one of the founders of the movement. Look for his portrait of Dostoevsky and the moving painting Troika, with its stark depiction of child labour. Ivan Kramskoi (room 20) was another of the original Wanderers, and Ivan Shishkin (room 25) was a landscape painter closely associated with the movement.
Viktor Vasnetsov (room 26) paints fantastical depictions of fairy tales and historical figures. His painting Bogatyry (Heroes) is perhaps the best example from the revivalist movement, although A Knight at the Crossroads is more dramatic. By contrast, Vasily Vereshchagin (room 27) is known for his harsh realism, especially in battle scenes. The Apotheosis of War, for example, is far from subtle.
Vasily Surikov (room 28) excels at large-scale historical scenes. Boyarina Morozova captures the history of the schism in the Orthodox Church and how it tragically played out for one family.
Ilya Repin (rooms 29 and 30) is perhaps the most beloved Russian realist painter. Ivan the Terrible and his Son Ivan is downright chilling. Room 31 has a few masterpieces by Nicholas Ge, another founder of the Peredvizhniki movement.
Mikhail Vrubel (rooms 32 to 34) was a Symbolist-era artist who defies classification. One entire wall is covered with his fantastic art nouveau mural The Princess of the Dream. More famous though is the melancholy Demon Seated, inspired by Mikhail Lermontov's poem.
1st Floor
A selection of Isaac Levitan’s landscapes is in room 37. Mikhail Nesterov (room 39) combines Symbolism with religious themes. The Vision of the Youth Bartholomew depicts an episode from the childhood of St Sergius of Radonezh (patron saint of Russia). In rooms 41 and 42, Valentin Serov was the most celebrated portraitist of his time.
Moving into the 20th century, artists began to reject the rules of realism. Room 43 displays Konstantin Korovin’s foray into Impressionism. Alexander Golovin and Boris Kustodiev represent the ‘World of Art’ art nouveau movement in room 44. In room 46, Pavel Kuznetsov was the founder of the Blue Rose, the Moscow group of Symbolist artists. Nikolai Rerikh (Nicholas Roerich) shows off his fantastical storytelling style in room 47.
Rooms 49 to 54 contain drawings, watercolours, pastels and prints, with rotating exhibits of works from the museum’s permanent collection. Room 55 houses the Treasury, with its collection of metals, jewellery, embroidery and precious knick-knacks.
Icons are found in rooms 56 to 62. Andrei Rublyov’s Holy Trinity (1420s) from Sergiev Posad, regarded as Russia’s greatest icon, is in room 60. Within the museum grounds is the Church of St Nicholas in Tolmachi ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; hnoon-4pm Tue-Sun), which was transferred to this site and restored in 1997. The centrepiece is the revered 12th-century Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God, protector of all Russia, which was transferred here from the Assumption Cathedral in the Kremlin.

The Tretyakov hosts exciting temporary exhibits in the Engineer’s Building, next to the main building.

GORKY PARK
Moscow's main city getaway is not your conventional expanse of nature preserved deep inside an urban jungle. Its mission is to mix leisure and culture in equal proportions. Designed in the 1920s by avant-garde architect Konstantin Melnikov as a piece of communist utopia, these days it showcases the enlightened transformation Moscow has undergone in recent years.


dimbar76/shutterstock ©
Activities
The list of activities on offer could easily cover the Rosetta Stone, although on sunny days thousands opt for complete inactivity atop one of the giant cushions scattered around the park.
Cyclists and rollerbladers create a bit of a traffic jam in the park during weekends, but they can enjoy a vehicle-free, 16km riverside ride to Vorobyovy Gory and back. There are several bicycle- and skate-rental places around the park, with one conveniently located under the pedestrian bridge.
Sport fans will find dedicated areas for beach volleyball, urban and extreme sports, table tennis and even pétanque – played by local Francophones and hipsters at Le Boule bar.
Pionersky pond near the park entrance now comes with a small sandy beach, where you can sunbathe and not so much bathe as walk in shallow water.
In summer, the park is totally engulfed in the dance craze – young people gather in their hundreds to learn every conceivable type of dance, including acrobatic rock ´n' roll, salsa and polka. The epicentre of this madness is located on the boardwalk under Andreyevsky Bridge ( GOOGLE MAP ), but there are a few more dancing venues inside the park.
When temperatures drop, Gorky Park becomes a winter wonderland. The ponds are flooded, turning the park into the city’s biggest ice-skating rink. Ice skates are available to rent; bring your passport.
Culture
After decades as a tacky and neglected fun fair, Gorky Park is once again a real Park Kultury (or park of culture) as Muscovites normally call it. It is the venue for almost weekly musical, theatre, art and culinary festivals.
Art objects pop up throughout the park as part of various exhibitions and festivals, but Darya Zhukova's Garage Museum of Contemporary Art plays the flagship role. Unfortunately, little is preserved of the prewar Soviet sculptures that adorned the park's walkways, but if you walk southwest to the adjoining gardens of Neskuchny Sad, you will find a bronze female swimmer about to jump into the Moscow River.
Also at Neskuchny Sad, the open-air Stas Namin Theatre hosts concerts as well as its own performances, mostly from the rock opera genre. Back in Gorky Park, the open-air Pioner cinema shows films after dark, although almost all are entirely in Russian. Its new competitor, Garage Screen, is located in front of Garage Museum of Contemporary Art.
Neskuchny Sad
As you head southwest along the river, past Andreyevsky Bridge, you'll find yourself in what looks more like a conventional park. Neskuchny Sad is much less crowded than Gorky Park, full of shade, and criss-crossed by walking and cycling paths that go up and down through deep ravines. It contains several sports facilities, including tennis courts, as well as open-air table tennis and chess clubs. There is also an open-air gym.
GORKY PARK MUSEUM

You can observe the park as well as much of Moscow from the top of the giant Stalin-era arch at the entrance. Access is via the Gorky Park Museum. See p000 for more.
Neskuchny literally means 'not dull', which sounds as weird in Russian as it does in English. 'Sad' simply means 'gardens' – it's not sad at all!
TAKE A BREAK

The whole place is designed for taking a break from work and urban madness! The park is dotted with eateries, such as AC/DC in Tbilisi, and there are also numerous small kiosks, the main cluster being the Gorky Park Food Row. For drinks (and a game of pétanque) head to Le Boule.

BOLOTNAYA PLOSHCHADSQUARE
(Болотная площадь MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Named after the swamp it used to be, Bolotnaya has a lot to tell about those who rebelled against the Kremlin, which views it warily from the other side of the river. Comprised of gardens and a bulging section of the city's main avenue, flanked by the grim constructivist Dom na Naberezhnoy ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-959 0317; www.museumdom.narod.ru; ul Serafimovicha 2; adult/child R100/50; h10am-6.30pm Tue, Wed & Fri, 11am-9pm Thu, 11am-6pm Sat & Sun; mKropotkinskaya), it was the scene of the public executions of the leaders of two of Russia's main peasant uprisings – Stepan Razin and Yemelyan Pugachev.
Centuries later, prominent Bolsheviks who proudly moved into the newly built Dom na Naberezhnoy in the 1920s were disappearing from their flats almost every night during Stalin's purges. A small museum tells the story of the house's most prominent inhabitants. The walls of the house are adorned with numerous plaques commemorating its famous residents. If the year of the death is 1937 or 1938, it most likely means that the person was executed during the most brutal wave of terror.
The Repinsky skver gardens across the square draw punks, hippies and Lord of the Rings re-enactment fans on summer nights. The gardens contain an intriguing sculpture by Mikhail Shemyakin, Children are Victims of Adults’ Vices (with the vices depicted in delightful detail). In 2012 Bolotnaya Sq became the site of anti-Putin protests commonly known as the Bolotnaya movement.
RED OCTOBERARTS CENTRE
(Завод Красный Октябрь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bersenevskaya nab; mKropotkinskaya)F
This defiant island of Russian modernity and Europeanness is a vibrant arts centre filled with cool bars, restaurants and galleries. With an aptly revolutionary name, the former Red October chocolate factory looks straight into the Kremlin's eyes – a vivid reminder that Russia is not all about totalitarian control and persecution.
Made of red brick, like its imperial vis-à-vis across the river, the factory was built by German national Theodor Ferdinand von Einem and proudly bore his name until the Bolshevik takeover. Production ended in the noughties, when its conversion into Moscow's hottest restaurant and entertainment area began. These days it is a key part of the hipster belt stretching along the river into Gorky Park and beyond. Come here to rub shoulders with Moscow's smart, cool and beautiful in one of the rooftop bars or check out an exhibition at Lumiere Brothers Photography Centre.
A huge power-station building here was under reconstruction at the time of writing, slated to open as another major modern art venue in 2019 under the name of GES-2.
LUMIERE BROTHERS PHOTOGRAPHY CENTREGALLERY
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.lumiere.ru; Bolotnaya nab 3, bldg 1; R200-430; hnoon-9pm Tue-Fri, to 10pm Sat & Sun)
One of the main pilgrimage destinations for photography fanatics, this modern and competently curated space frequently hosts changing exhibitions of Russian and Western photo artists. There is a nice shop selling photo albums and postcards on the premises.
ART MUZEON & KRYMSKAYA NABEREZHNAYAPUBLIC ART
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mPark Kultury)F
Moscow's answer to London's South Bank, Krymskaya Nab (Crimea Embankment) features wave-shaped street architecture with Scandinavian-style wooden elements, beautiful flowerbeds and a moody fountain, which ejects water randomly from many holes in the ground to the excitement of children and adults alike. It has merged with the Art Muzeon park and its motley collection of Soviet stone idols (Stalin, Sverdlov, a selection of Lenins and Brezhnevs) that were ripped from their pedestals in the post-1991 wave of anti-Soviet feeling.
The embankment is now fully revamped from the pedestrian Patriarshy bridge – which links it to the Red October gentrified industrial area on Bolotny Island – to the wide passage under Krymsky bridge that provides access to Gorky Park. A mammoth-sized eyesore, the statue of Peter the Great authored by the controversial sculptor Zurab Tsereteli, surveys the area from a giant column standing at the tip of Bolotny Island. A similarly huge shoebox-shaped Brezhnev-era concrete edifice in the middle of the park contains the New Tretyakov Gallery and the Central House of Artists, a major exhibition space. Next to it, the Vernisage market is the place where artists exhibit their work – mostly commercial kitsch, but you can find a gem or two here, if you are lucky.
We'd call this area fully pedestrianised, if not for the cyclists and inline skaters who often create what resembles a typical Moscow traffic jam. There is a shop renting bicycles and inline-skating equipment. This is the starting point of the vehicle-free 8km route that runs through Gorky Park, Neskuchny Sad and Vorobyovy Gory.
NEW TRETYAKOV GALLERYGALLERY

Moscow's premier venue for 20th-century Russian art, this branch of the Tretyakov Gallery has much more than the typical socialist-realist images of muscle-bound men wielding scythes and busty women milking cows (although there’s that, too). The exhibits showcase avant-garde artists such as Malevich, Kandinsky, Chagall, Goncharova and Popova, as well as nonconformist artists of the 1960s and 1970s who refused to accept the official style.
In the same building, Central House of Artists (Центральный дом художника; ЦДХ MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cha.ru; admission R350; h11am-7pm Tue-Sun; mOktyabrskaya), also known as TsDKh, is a huge exhibit space used for contemporary-art shows.

(Музей Парка Горького MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-995 0020; ul Krymsky val 9, str 11; adult/student R300/150; mOktyabrskaya, Park Kultury)
The grandiose colonnaded arch that serves as Gorky Park's front entrance now contains a museum, its exhibition largely comprised of old photographs and screens showing Soviet-era newsreels about the park. The main reason for paying the hefty entrance fee is to access the roof of the arch, from where one can observe the entire park and much of central Moscow.

The brainchild of Moscow art fairy Darya Zhukova, Garage is one of the capital's hottest modern-art venues. In mid-2015 the museum moved to spectacular new digs in Gorky Park – a derelict Soviet-era building, renovated by the visionary Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. It hosts exhibitions, lectures, films and interactive educational programs, featuring Russian and international artists. A good cafe and a bookstore are also on the premises.
As you enter, pay attention to the part-ruined Soviet-era wall mosaics, conserved in the manner of ancient mosaics. Lectures and film screenings regularly occur here and at Garage Screen open-air cinema, located across the square favoured by inline skaters. The museum's large bookstore is mostly dedicated to art.
CHURCH OF ST JOHN THE WARRIORCHURCH

The finest of all Zamoskvorechie’s churches mixes Moscow and European baroque styles, resulting in a melange of shapes and colours. It was commissioned by Peter the Great in thanks for his 1709 victory over Sweden at Poltava. The gilt, wood-carved iconostasis was originally installed in the nearby Church of the Resurrection at Kadashi.

Russia’s foremost stage museum, founded in 1894, is in the neo-Gothic mansion on the north side of Paveletskaya pl. The museum exhibits all things theatrical – stage sets, costumes, scripts and personal items belonging to some of Russia’s stage greats. The exhibits are not limited to drama, also tracing the development of opera, ballet and puppetry.
Highlights include the costumes and stage set from Boris Godunov (starring the famous bass, Fyodor Chaliapin) and the ballet shoes worn by Vaslav Nijinsky.
DANILOV MONASTERYMONASTERY
(Даниловский монастырь GOOGLE MAP ; www.msdm.ru; ul Danilovsky val; h7am-7pm; mTulskaya)F
The headquarters of the Russian Orthodox Church stands behind white fortress walls. On holy days this place seethes with worshippers murmuring prayers, lighting candles and ladling holy water into jugs at the tiny chapel inside the gates. The Danilov Monastery was built in the late 13th century by Daniil, the first Prince of Moscow, as an outer city defence.
The monastery was repeatedly altered over the next several hundred years, and served as a factory and a detention centre during the Soviet period. It was restored in time to replace Sergiev Posad as the Church’s spiritual and administrative centre, and became the official residence of the Patriarch during the Russian Orthodoxy’s millennium celebrations in 1988.
Enter beneath the pink St Simeon Stylite Gate-Church on the north wall. The oldest and busiest church is the Church of the Holy Fathers of the Seven Ecumenical Councils, where worship is held continuously from 10am to 5pm daily. Founded in the 17th century and rebuilt repeatedly, the church contains several chapels on two floors: the main one upstairs is flanked by side chapels to St Daniil (on the northern side) and Sts Boris and Gleb (south). On the ground level, the small main chapel is dedicated to the Protecting Veil, and the northern one to the prophet Daniil.
The yellow neoclassical Trinity Cathedral, built in the 1830s, is an austere counterpart to the other buildings. West of the cathedral are the patriarchate’s External Affairs Department and, at the far end of the grounds, the Patriarch’s official residence. Against the north wall, to the east of the residence, there’s a 13th-century Armenian carved-stone cross, or khachkar, a gift from the Armenian Church. The church guesthouse, in the southern part of the monastery grounds, has been turned into the elegant Danilovskaya Hotel.
DONSKOY MONASTERYMONASTERY
(Донской монастырь GOOGLE MAP ; %495-952 1646; www.donskoi.org; Donskaya ul; mShabolovskaya)
Moscow's youngest monastery, Donskoy was founded in 1591 as the home of the Virgin of the Don icon, now in the Tretyakov Gallery. This icon is credited with the victory in the 1380 battle of Kulikovo; it’s also said that, in 1591, the Tatar Khan Giri retreated without a fight after the icon showered him with burning arrows in a dream.
Most of the monastery, surrounded by a brick wall with 12 towers, was built between 1684 and 1733 under Regent Sofia and Peter the Great. The Virgin of Tikhvin Church over the north gate, built in 1713 and 1714, is one of the last examples of Moscow baroque. In the centre of the grounds is the large brick New Cathedral, built between 1684 and 1693. Just to its south is the smaller Old Cathedral, dating from 1591 to 1593.
When burials in central Moscow were banned after the 1771 plague, the Donskoy Monastery became a graveyard for the nobility, and it is littered with elaborate tombs and chapels.
Donskoy Monastery is a five-minute walk from Shabolovskaya metro. Go south along ul Shabolovka, then take the first street west, 1-y Donskoy proezd.

TSARITSYNO PALACE

Architect Vasily Bazhenov worked on the project for 10 years before he was sacked. She hired another architect, Matvey Kazakov, but the project eventually ran out of money. For hundreds of years, the palace was little more than a shell, until the Russian government finally decided to finish it in 2007.
Nowadays, the Great Palace is a fantastical building that combines old Russian, Gothic, classical and Arabic styles. Inside, exhibits are dedicated to the history of Tsaritsyno, as well as the life of Catherine the Great. The nearby kitchen building, or khlebny dom (Хлебный дом GOOGLE MAP ; Khlebny Dom & Great Palace adult/student R350/100), also hosts rotating exhibits, sometimes culinary and sometimes covering topics such as icons and art. The khlebny dom is a pleasant place to hear classical concerts in summer.
The extensive grounds include some other lovely buildings, such as the Small Palace, the working Church of Our Lady Lifegiving Spring, the cavalier buildings, greenhouses with tropical plants and some interesting bridges. A pond is bedecked with a fantastic fountain set to music. The English-style wooded park stretches all the way south to the Upper Tsaritsynsky Pond, which has rowing boats available for hire in summer, and west to the Tsaritsyno Palace complex.
Tsaritsyno park is best accessed from Orekhovo metro station – the entrance is right by the station. From there, walk towards the ponds past an open-air stage, where old folks gather to dance to 1960s tunes in summer, then turn right towards the palace.

LENGTH 3KM; TWO TO FOUR HOURS
From the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour a pedestrian bridge leads across the Moscow River to Bolotny Island, a slice of land south of the Kremlin. The 1Patriarshy most offers a fantastic panorama of the Kremlin towers and of the cathedral itself.
South of the bridge on Bolotny Island is the old 2Red October chocolate factory, now housing a heaving art and entertainment cluster, as well as the centrepiece 3Strelka Institute.
Detour north along Sofiyskaya nab to 4Dom na Naberezhnoy, which was a prestigious residential building during Soviet times, but became one of Moscow's most infamous addresses during Stalin's purges. It faces 5Bolotnaya ploshchad, the scene of anti-Putin protests in 2012.
Walk across the Maly Kamenny most. The 6Tretyakov Gallery is a few blocks to the east, but if you don’t want to be sidetracked for the rest of the day, head south along the pedestrianised embankment passing Zurab Tsereteli’s monstrous sculpture of 7Peter the Great.
From the embankment, along the beautifully revamped Krymskaya Naberezhnaya, enter the 8Art Muzeon sculpture park, an art museum and history lesson all in one. From here, you can enter the 9New Tretyakov Gallery, dedicated to 20th-century art.
Proceed to Gorky Park via the passage under Krymsky most, then turn left and walk towards the park's official entrance, where a large colonnaded arch contains aGorky Park Museum. Pay for the entrance and take an elevator to the roof of the arch to admire the views of the park and examine your route from this perfect vantage point.
Back on earth, walk past the large bmusical fountain towards the cGarage Museum of Contemporary Art. Check out an exhibition or two and proceed to the corner of the park where AC/DC in Tbilisi and neighbouring Le Boule will save you from hunger and thirst.
Continue along the pond towards Andreyevsky pedestrian bridge. If you time your arrival to coincide with sunset – especially at the end of the week – you'll probably find hundreds of people dancing on the embankment underneath.

Georgian food has never been known to be fast, but this fledgling chain is bringing about a revolution.

That's not quite how they do it in Georgia, but it fits into Moscow's crazy lifestyle just fine.
DOM KAFERUSSIAN€
(Очень домашнее кафе MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-951 1734; http://homecafe.rest; Pyatnitskaya ul 9/28, str 1; mains R420-580; h9am-midnight; mNovokuznetskaya)
The name, which translates as 'a very homey cafe', is also its motto. This is as close as it gets to the kind of food Russians eat at home, which inevitably means borsch (beetroot soup) or mushroom soup for starters, and all kinds of kotlety (meat, chicken or fish cutlets) as the main course.
Portions are fairly small, and appetisers go for about the same price as main courses, which may bring the cost of the entire meal close to R1000 per person.
MARUKAMEJAPANESE€
(Марукамэ MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.marukame.ru; Pyatnitskaya ul 29; mains R170-310; h11am-11pm; mNovokuznetskaya)
This superpopular and conveniently located self-service noodle shop draws crowds of office workers during lunch break – hence a long, but fast-moving queue. Apart from udon noodles, the menu also features donburi rice dishes, tempura skewers and rolls.
SOKVEGETARIAN€
(Сок MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-953 7963; http://cafe-cok.ru; Lavrushinsky per 15; mains R340-400; h11am-11pm; WvE; mTretyakovskaya)
Citrus-coloured walls and delicious fresh-squeezed juices are guaranteed to brighten your day. All the soups, salads, pasta and fabulous desserts are vegetarian, with many vegan options too. The menu even features a few Russian classics such as beef stroganoff, made with seitan (a wheat-based meat substitute).
GORKY PARK FOOD ROWINTERNATIONAL€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Gorky Park; mains R200-400; hall day; mOktyabrskaya)
The kind of food row you'd find at a Christmas market, but with a strong hipster flavour – hence the inevitable gourmet burgers and falafels, as well as delicious khachapuri (cheese pastry) and churchkhela (Georgian sweet made of grape syrup and walnuts).
GRABLYCAFETERIA€
(Грабли MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.grably.ru; Pyatnitskaya ul 27; mains R200-300; h10am-11pm; Wvc; mNovokuznetskaya)
This big buffet features an amazing array of fish, poultry and meat, salads, soups and desserts. After you run the gauntlet and pay the bill, take a seat in the elaborate winter-garden seating area. This Zamoskvorechie outlet is particularly impressive, with two levels of tiled floors, vines draped over wrought-iron rails, and chandeliers suspended from the high ceilings.
oDANILOVSKY MARKETMARKET€€
( GOOGLE MAP ; www.danrinok.ru; Mytnaya ul 74; mains R400-600; h8am-8pm; mTulskaya)
A showcase of the area's ongoing gentrification, this giant Soviet-era farmers market is now largely about deli food cooked and served in myriad little eateries, including such gems as a Dagestani dumpling shop and a Vietnamese pho-soup kitchen. The market itself looks very orderly, if a tiny bit artificial, with uniformed vendors and thoughtfully designed premises.
Even if you’re not shopping, it’s entertaining to peruse the tables piled high with multicoloured produce: homemade cheese and jam, golden honey straight from the hive, vibrantly coloured spices pouring out of plastic bags, slippery silver fish posing on beds of ice, and huge slabs of meat hanging from the ceiling.
BARDELIINDIAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-968-665 5114; Pyatnitskaya ul 56, str 4; set lunch R400-600, set dinner R1200-1500; hnoon-midnight)
Bardeli's well-travelled owner (also responsible for the Jean-Jacques and John Donn restaurant chains) has a playful and ironic attitude to the notion of authenticity, resulting in this pretty cafe with simple painted-wood decor, funny paired plastic chairs and thali sets served in dabba metal pots. Portions are tiny and service is pretty authentic in both attentiveness and slow delivery.
SYROVARNYAEASTERN EUROPEAN€€

Domestic cheese production is all the rage in Russia, which has banned cheese imports from the EU in retaliation for Western sanctions. This restaurant serves hearty, homey meals, most of which contain cheese produced right here – in a micro-creamery that you see first thing after coming inside. A shop selling top-quality cheese is also on the premises.
MITZVA BARISRAELI€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-532 4224; www.facebook.com/mitzva.msk; Pyatnitskaya ul 3/4, str 1; mains R750-820; h3pm-3am; mNovokuznetskaya)
A baby of the recent Israeli food craze, this restaurant-cum-bar hides in an atmospheric vaulted cellar decorated with Judaic and Masonic symbols. The talented chef's wild imagination turns Jewish standards, such as gefilte fish (stuffed carp), into art objects fit for the fusion cuisine of the future. There are great cocktails, too.
FEDYA, DICH!FUSION€€
(Федя, дичь! GOOGLE MAP ; %8-916-747 0110; Mytnaya ul 74; mains R650-820; h11am-11pm; mTulskaya)
Let's take a walk on the wild side of the Moscow food scene. This place gets fresh supplies of fish and game from faraway corners of Siberia. Sea of Japan oysters and Arctic fish tartare are fresh and delicious despite crossing eight time zones to land on your table; so are wild-boar cutlets and deer steaks with forest berries.
CORREA'SEUROPEAN€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-725 6035; ul Bolshaya Ordynka 40/2; mains R450-650; h8am-11pm; aWvE; mPolyanka)
Correa’s has outlets all over the city, and though none are quite as cosy and quaint as the original in Presnya, a restaurant with a bit more space has its advantages. This one is oddly located in a cement courtyard, but it offers outdoor seating and a spacious, light-filled interior. Fresh ingredients and simple preparations guarantee the food is impeccable.
CHUGUNNY MOSTBISTRO€€
(Чугунный мост MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-959 4418; www.facebook.com/chugunniimost; Pyatnitskaya ul 6; mains R700-1000; h9am-midnight; mTretyakovskaya)
This place illustrates the direction in which the entire Moscow restaurant scene seems to be heading – a bistro-cum-bar that would not be out of place in somewhere like Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin. The subdued, wood-dominated decor is almost therapeutic and the inventive, postethnic food makes you want to live or work in the vicinity, just so it can be your local.
The R550 set-lunch deal is about the best value for money in town. The place is a good breakfast choice, too.
oBJÖRNSCANDINAVIAN€€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-953 9059; http://bjorn.rest; Pyatnitskaya ul 3; mains R600-1200; mNovokuznetskaya)
A neat cluster of fir trees on a busy street hides a Nordic gem that deserves a saga to glorify its many virtues. This is not an ‘ethnic’ restaurant, but a presentation of futuristic Scandinavian cuisine straight out of a science fiction movie. From salads to desserts, every dish looks deceptively simple, visually perfect and 23rd century.
PANCHO VILLAMEXICAN€€€
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-238 7913; www.panchovilla.ru; ul Bolshaya Yakimanka 52; meals R850-1500; h24hr; WvE; mOktyabrskaya)
Near Oktyabrskaya pl, this is Moscow’s top choice for ‘Meksikansky’ food. If the fajitas and margaritas aren’t enough of a draw, come for breakfast burritos, happy-hour specials or live Latin music nightly (from 8pm).
WORTH A DETOUR
KOLOMENSKOE MUSEUM-RESERVE

Set amidst 4 sq km of picturesque parkland, on a bluff above a bend in the Moscow River, Kolomenskoe (Музей-заповедник “Коломенское” GOOGLE MAP ; www.mgomz.com; hgrounds 8am-9pm; mKolomenskaya, Kashirskaya) is an ancient royal country seat and a Unesco World Heritage Site. Shortly after its founding in the 14th century, the village became a favourite destination for the princes of Moscow. The royal estate is now an eclectic mix of churches and gates, as well as other buildings that were added to the complex over the years.
From Bolshaya ul, enter at the rear of the grounds through the 17th-century Saviour Gate to the whitewashed Our Lady of Kazan Church, both built in the time of Tsar Alexey. The church faces the site of his great wooden palace, which was demolished in 1768 by Catherine the Great. Ahead, the white, tent-roofed 17th-century front gate and clock tower mark the edge of the old inner-palace precinct. The golden double-headed eagle that tops the gate is the symbol of the Romanov dynasty. The adjacent buildings house an interesting museum with a bit of everything: a model of Alexey’s wooden palace, material on rebellions associated with Kolomenskoe, and Russian handicrafts from clocks and tiles to woodcarving and metalwork.
Built in the mid-17th century, the wooden palace of Tsar Alexey (Дворец царя Алексея Михайловича GOOGLE MAP ; pr Andropova 39; R400; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun; mKashirskaya) was dubbed ‘the eighth wonder of the world’. This whimsical building was famous for its mishmash of tent-roofed towers and onion-shaped eaves, all crafted from wood and structured without a single nail. Unfortunately, the legendary building fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1768 by Catherine the Great, until some 230 years later, a kitschy gingerbread replica, complete with its opulent interior based on historic records, was built in the grounds.
Outside the front gate, overlooking the river, rises Kolomenskoe’s loveliest structure, the quintessentially Russian Ascension Church ( GOOGLE MAP ; pr Andropova 39; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun; mKolomenskaya). Built between 1530 and 1532 for Grand Prince Vasily III, it probably celebrated the birth of his heir, Ivan the Terrible. It is actually an important development in Russian architecture, reproducing the shapes of wooden churches in brick for the first time, and paving the way for Moscow's great St Basil’s Cathedral 25 years later. Immediately west of it are the round 16th-century St George’s Bell Tower and a 17th-century tower. About 300m further southwest, across a gully, the white St John the Baptist Church was built for Ivan the Terrible in the 1540s or 1550s. It has four corner chapels that make it a stylistic ‘quarterway house’ between the Ascension Church and St Basil’s.
Among the old wooden buildings on the grounds is Peter the Great’s cabin, where he lived while supervising ship- and fort-building at Arkhangelsk. The cabin is surrounded by a recreation of the tsar’s orchards and gardens.
6DRINKING & NIGHTLIFE

The area between Tretyakovskaya and Novokuznetskaya metros is best for a pub crawl.

oBAR STRELKACAFE, CLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.barstrelka.com; Bersenevskaya nab 14/5, bldg 5a; h9am-midnight Mon-Thu, to 3am Fri, noon-3am Sat, noon-midnight Sun; W; mKropotkinskaya)
Located just below the Patriarshy most, the bar-restaurant at the Strelka Institute is the ideal starting point for an evening in the Red October complex. The rooftop terrace has unbeatable Moscow River views, but the interior is equally cool in a shabby-chic sort of way. The bar menu is excellent and there is usually somebody tinkling the ivories.
oGIPSYCLUB, CAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.bargipsy.ru; Bolotnaya nab 3/4; h6pm-1am Sun-Thu, 2pm-6am Fri & Sat)
Euphoria reigns in this postmodern nomad camp of a bar with its strategic rooftop position on Red October. The decor is bright-coloured kitsch, which among other oddities means fake palm trees and toilet doors covered with artificial fur. The DJ and live-music repertoires are aptly eclectic.
You don't have to be rich to pass the face control, but some natural coolness does help.
ROLLING STONECLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/pg/BarRollingStone; Bolotnaya nab 3; h6pm-1am Mon-Thu, 6am-10am Fri, 2pm-10am Sat, 2pm-7am Sun; mKropotkinskaya)
Plastered with covers of the namesake magazine and lit by naked bulbs, this place has the feel of an upscale dive bar. The music spans all genres and there is a small dance floor if you are so inclined. What makes it upscale is its location in the ultratrendy Red October complex, and of course the clientele.
They might be dressed in casual gear but they still have to look impeccable to get past the face control.
UNDERDOGCRAFT BEER
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Klimentovsky per 12, str 14; h2pm-2am; mTretyakovskaya)
This cosy little pub hidden away from the perpetually crowded Klimentovsky per has the melancholy of an Edward Hopper painting or a good road movie. The beer menu is an all-encompassing list of IPAs, APAs, lagers, krieks and whatnot – mostly produced at local microbreweries. Some Russian beers come with crazy names like Shaman Has Three Hands.
LE BOULEBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-518 8412; Gorky Park; hnoon-midnight; W; mOktyabrskaya)
The goatee and moustache factor is high in this hipster-ridden verandah bar that comes with a dozen pétanque lanes. Grab a pitcher of sangria or a pint of cider and have a go at what is arguably the most alcohol-compatible sport. Live bands often play on the verandah in the early evening.
DICTATURA ESTETICABAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-991 9946; www.facebook.com/dictaturabar; Bersenevskaya nab 6, str 1; h24hr; mPolyanka, Kropotkinskaya)
Aesthetics indeed rule this stylish little bar, but its main appeal lies in the gin cocktails based on secret potions, which its mixologists produce out of anything that grows. We tried the nettle mix and it tasted great. They serve quality food with South Asian motifs.
COFFEE BEANCAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.coffeebean.ru; Pyatnitskaya ul 5; h8am-11pm; mTretyakovskaya)
One could claim that Coffee Bean started the coffee craze in Moscow. While the original location on Tverskaya ul is no longer open, there are a few of these excellent, affordable cafes around town. Try their trademark Raf coffee, invented years ago by a customer and now spreading around the world, without anyone realising it comes from Russia.
MOJOBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-999 0507; www.facebook.com/mojobarmoscow; ul Valovaya 26; h9am-midnight; mDobryninskaya)
The name may not sound original, but these guys do get your mojo working! Their magic formula includes outstanding cocktails, classily understated design with subdued lights, great deli food, modern art on the walls and DJ music. The expat owners mingle and drink with patrons – sometimes so hard, they can't open shop on Sunday.
BAGA BARBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-532 5320; http://bagabar.com; Pyatnitskaya ul 25, str 1; h24hr; mNovokuznetskaya)
Ready to satisfy your thirst and hunger (both literal and social) at any time of day and night, this venue comes with human-sized maharaja dolls, waiters dressed in Indian army uniforms and a summer terrace that fills up with a crowd of office workers on the loose. Get a beer or a cocktail and watch Moscow corporates in their element.
Expertly cooked Indian and Uzbek food is also available.
PARKACRAFT BEER
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-926-160 6313; www.facebook.com/parkacraft; Pyatnitskaya ul 22, str 1; h1pm-2am; mNovokuznetskaya)
'Parka' is a banya (bathhouse) term, hence the sauna-like decor, and just like a proper banya, this a very relaxing place. The friendly bartenders let you try any beer before you commit to buying a pint; the brews, many with crazy Runglish names, are mostly local.
KUSOCHKIBAR
(Pieces; GOOGLE MAP ; %495-114 5525; www.kusochki-cafe.ru; ul Shabolovka 63; hnoon-midnight Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat; mShabolovskaya)
This Shabolovka district local is an alcohol-infused version of the Mad Hatter's tea party with a hint of BDSM. It features waitresses dressed as paramedics and policewomen, cocktails served in drip bags and a table inside a prison cell, where you can handcuff your drinking buddies if that sounds like a fun thing to do. Extensive drinks list and good food.
GARAGE CLUBCLUB
(Клуб Гараж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.garageclub.ru; Brodnikov per 8; h24hr; mPolyanka)
This is the only place in Moscow you can drink and drive. Not to be confused with the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, this is the reincarnation of a Yeltsin-era nightclub with the same car seats to lounge in as in the original. Nowadays, it’s the place to strut your R&B stuff on the dance floor.
It gets packed in the early-morning hours of the weekend (technically Saturday and Sunday), when the clubbing crowd comes for the famous ‘after party’.
KVARTIRA 44BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-238 8234; www.kv44.ru; ul Malaya Yakimanka 24/8; hnoon-midnight Sun-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; W; mPolyanka)
Back in the olden days, the best place to go for a drink was your neighbour’s flat, which would be crowded with mismatched furniture and personal memorabilia. This is the atmosphere evoked at ‘Apartment 44’, where the drinks flow, the music plays and life is merry.
KARLSONBAR
(Карлсон MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-985-751 1919; http://ginza.ru/msk/restaurant/karlson; Ovchinnikovskaya nab 20/1; hnoon-midnight Sun-Thu, to 3am Fri & Sat; mNovokuznetskaya)
Karlson is posh (though not at all tasteless) and boasts a spectacular view of Moscow from its rooftop position, which is the main reason to throw a few thousand roubles on wine and cocktails, or even super-expensive food, here. Rest assured that quality will match the price. The bar is located inside a business centre.
Just say you are going to Karlson at the entrance.
PUEROPORTTEAHOUSE
(Chaynaya Vysota; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-225 5996; http://cha108.ru; Pushkinskaya nab, Gorky Park; h11am-9pm Mon-Fri, 10am-11pm Sat & Sun; mPark Kultury, Oktyabrskaya)
Don't leave Gorky Park without trying one of the invigorating tea-based drinks at this kiosk-like outlet on the embankment. Here, they mix tea with sweet syrups made in-house from such ingredients as fir-tree needles, pine cones and cloudberries. For a snack, get a pie with feijoa, a kiwi-like Brazilian fruit that's now massively cultivated in the Caucasus.
PITCHER PUBCRAFT BEER
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-120 2417; www.pitcher.pub; Pyatnitskaya ul 82/34, str 1; h2pm-2am Sun & Mon, to 3am Tue-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; mDobryninskaya)
This strategically located little bar is all about craft beer with a couple of dozen ales, stouts and lagers on tap, coming from Russian and European microbreweries. The attitude is near-academic, and if you feel like debating the merits of blackberry braggot or hazelnut brown ale, this is definitely your place.
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
EASY STEAMING: ESSENTIAL BANYA

The dos and don’ts of the banya:
ADo take advantage of the plunge pool (or at least the cold shower, if there is no pool on-site). It’s important to bring your body temperature back down after being in the banya.
ADon’t bother with a bathing suit. Most public bani are segregated by gender, in which case bathers steam naked. In mixed company, wrap yourself in a sheet (provided at the banya).
ADo rehydrate in between steams. Tea or even beer are common, but it is also important to drink water or juice.
ADon’t stop at one! Most bathers will return to the parilka (steam room) several times over the course of an hour or two.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-730 1011; www.mmdm.ru; Kosmodemyanskaya nab 52/8; tickets R200-2000; mPaveletskaya)
This graceful, modern glass building has three halls, including Svetlanov Hall, which holds the largest organ in Russia. Needless to say, organ concerts held here are impressive. This is the usual venue for performances by the National Philharmonic of Russia, a privately financed, highly lauded, classical-music organisation. Founded in 1991, the symphony is directed and conducted by the esteemed Vladimir Spivakov.
STRELKA INSTITUTEARTS CENTRE

Although not a major commercial area, Zamoskvorechie has a couple of shops worth checking out.

GZHEL PORCELAINCERAMICS

ALYONKACHOCOLATE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.shop.alenka.ru; Bersenevskaya nab 6, str 1; h10am-8pm; mPolyanka, Kropotkinskaya)
Although the old Red October chocolate factory has long been converted into a hipster den, you can still sample the products of Russian chocolatiers at the shop located at the far end of the old factory. Alyonka is an iconic Soviet brand of chocolate candies with a picture of a rosy-cheeked peasant girl wearing a kerchief on the wrapper.
ROTFRONTCHOCOLATE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; 2-y Novokuznetsky per 13/15; h9am-8pm Mon-Sat, to 5pm Sun; mNovokuznetskaya)
You know you're in an ex-Soviet country when a candy factory is named after a phrase German socialist workers greeted each other with in the 1920s. The factory is actually much older than its Soviet name, having catered to Moscow's sweet tooth since 1826. The shop sells largely the same toffees, caramel and chocolate candies as it did in the 1970s.

(Парк Горького MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-237 1266; ul Krymsky val; h10am-3pm & 5-11pm Tue-Sun; mPark Kultury)
When the temperatures drop, Gorky Park becomes a winter wonderland. The ponds are flooded, turning the park into the city’s biggest ice-skating rink, which includes a smaller and safer rink for children. Tracks are created for cross-country skiers to circumnavigate the park. Ice skates and cross-country skis are available to rent. Bring your passport.

Explore Meshchansky & Basmanny
Begin acquainting yourself with the area from Lubyanskaya pl, where the former KGB building looks over a modest stone that marks the millions of people who perished in the infamous Gulag camps. Before you start exploring, head up to the roof of Detsky Mir department store for a view over the neighbourhood.
Elegant ul Myasnitskaya leads to the Boulevard Ring, which creates a leafy pedestrian belt that runs all the way down to the Moscow River. With a beautiful pond that becomes a skating rink in winter, Chistoprudny bul is one of the loveliest parts of Moscow and great for a leisurely stroll.
A short walk will take you to ul Pokrovka, which – together with ul Maroseyka – has in recent years transformed into one of the city's best restaurant rows. This a great place to sit back with a cup of coffee and indulge in some people-watching.
From here, make your way towards Kursky railway station through the quieter lanes between Chistoprudny bul and the Garden Ring, where you'll see some nice churches and early-20th-century houses.
Cross the Garden Ring and go around the station area on the right-hand side before walking down ul Nizhnyaya Syromyatnicheskaya, which runs parallel to a railway overpass. Two passages under the railway track lead to a belt of centenarian factories that are becoming one of Moscow's hottest art, shopping and start-up scenes. The flagship Winzavod (accessed via the first passage), a former winery, is packed with galleries, while the nearby ArtPlay area (accessed via the second passage) specialises in modern design.

TOP SIGHT
WINZAVOD
A hundred years ago, industrialisation was a buzz word in Moscow, which is why the city is filled with rather imposing centenarian red-brick factories, all of them defunct. Today's buzz word is gentrification, which brings them back into the spotlight. The huge industrial area behind Kursky train station is being redeveloped as a hotspot for modern culture and start-ups.

It all began with Winzavod, a former wine-bottling factory. Its buildings still bear names such as 'Fermentation Workshop', but now they are packed with art galleries, funky shops and fashion showrooms. Sadly, politics has forced its flagship, M&J Guelman Gallery, to leave the area, but there are still a few good galleries to inspect, particularly the temporary exhibitions housed at Red & White Wine Workshops. The main courtyard is a great place to relax over a drink.
The nearby Manometer factory has also been touched by the magic wand of gentrification and is known as ArtPlay. It focuses on design, housing many furniture showrooms and antique stores. It's a bit of a maze, which is now expanding into adjacent industrial spaces. Halfway between it and the entrance, Edward's is a convenient pit stop for beer lovers.

Swarming with galleries, places to eat and quirky shops, the revitalised old factories at the back of Kursky railway station are the district's main draw. The relatively quiet central part of the neighbourhood is perfect for strolling, with a few notable sights to check out on the way. Further out, vast Sokolniki park makes a great escape from the city, while Izmaylovsky Market is a diverse – if kitschy – place to shop.

Changed beyond recognition in recent years, Sokolniki park is criss-crossed by cycling paths, and blends into a proper forest bordering on Losiny Ostrov national park (Национальный парк Лосиный остров). The area by the entrance (a short walk from Sokolniki metro station), centred on a fountain, is full of cool places to eat and welcoming benches. Further away, to the left of the entrance, is a funfair with rides and carousels. Another attraction is the Rosarium (Розариум), a manicured rose garden.
At least three outlets in the central part of the park hire out bicycles and other sporting equipment. In summer, beach bums head to the Basseyn (Бассейн) open-air swimming pool, which turns into a party zone in the evening. Come winter, the park opens a skating rink and Moscow's longest (200m) sledding hill. Dozens of intriguing exhibitions are scattered around the park, including the Modern Museum of Calligraphy and a showroom of ZIL limos, which transported Soviet leaders. All kinds of urban culture and sport festivals, including the popular Equestrian Fest (Конный Фестиваль; 29 August to 1 September), take place year round, with the main events occurring during weekends.
APTEKARSKY OGORODGARDENS
(Аптекарский огород GOOGLE MAP ; www.hortus.ru; pr Mira 26; adult/student R300/200; h10am-10pm May-Sep, to 5pm Oct-Apr; mProspekt Mira)
Moscow's lovely botanic garden was established in 1706. Originally owned by the Moscow general hospital to grow herbs and other medicinal plants, its name translates, unsurprisingly, as Pharmacy Garden. Visitors can wander along the trails, enjoy an exhibition of ornamental plants and explore three greenhouses containing plants from more southerly climes.
A glassy compound that separates the gardens from the street houses some of the city's best-loved cafe outlets, including Lavka Bratyev Karavayevykh, Lepim i Varim, Upside Down Cake & Co and Khachapuri. The latter comes with a garden-facing verandah, where you can linger over a meal or a bottle of wine. During weekends, Aptekarsky Ogorod becomes a venue for concerts, fashion shows and craft fairs.

The Leningradskaya – now owned and operated by Hilton – is the smallest of the Stalinist skyscrapers that dot the city. At 136m, it towers over Komsomolskaya pl, echoing the ornamentation on nearby Kazan Station. The architect Leonid Polyakov was apparently stripped of his Stalin Prize when Khrushchev decided the hotel was an inefficient use of space.

A 'design centre', ArtPlay occupies the buildings of the former Manometer factory and is home to firms specialising in urban planning and architectural design, as well as furniture showrooms and antique stores. Considering the architectural emphasis, there is perhaps less for the casual caller to see, although there are always diverse and dynamic rotating exhibits in the display spaces. Come here to feel the pulse of new Moscow.
LUBYANKAHISTORIC BUILDING
(Лубянка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Lubyanskaya pl; mLubyanka)
Easily the most feared edifice in Russia, looming on the northeastern side of Lubyanskaya pl is the brain centre behind Stalin's genocidal purges and the network of concentration camps known as Gulag. The building came into life circa 1900 as the headquarters of an insurance company, but was taken over by the CheKa (Bolshevik secret police) in 1919 and remained in the hands of its successors – OGPU, NKVD, MGB and finally KGB. The building is not open to the public.
The building's cellar contained an internal jail reserved for elite prisoners, such as Stalin's rival Nikolai Bukharin, Swedish Holocaust hero Raul Wallenberg, poet Osip Mandelshtam and Polish army commander Wladislaw Anders. Its last inmate, American pilot Gary Powers, captured during an ill-fated reconnaissance mission, was released in 1962.
In August 1991 a million-strong prodemocracy crowd was close to storming the building, but only succeeded in toppling the monument to CheKa founder Felix Dzerzhinsky, which stood in the middle square. You can now see it at the Art Muzeon Park, along with other fallen communist idols. Later, a large granite boulder, known as the Solovetsky Stone, was brought from the original Gulag site in the Solovetsky Islands and laid on the southeast side of the square to commemorate the victims of terror. Every year on 30 October, thousands of people form a long queue here to read out the names of the victims.
The freshly restored compound now houses the Federal Security Service, or Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti. The FSB is proud of its CheKa roots and keeps a pretty good eye on domestic goings on.
CHORAL SYNAGOGUENOTABLE BUILDING
(Московская Хopaльнaя Cинaгoга MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshoy Spasoglinishchevsky per 10; h9am-6pm; mKitay-Gorod)
Construction of a synagogue was banned inside Kitay Gorod, so Moscow’s oldest and most prominent synagogue was built just outside the city walls, not far from the Jewish settlement of Zaryadye. Construction started in 1881 but dragged on, due to roadblocks by the anti-Semitic tsarist government. It was finally completed in 1906 and was the only synagogue that continued to operate throughout the Soviet period, despite attempts to convert it into a workers’ club.
Apparently, Golda Meir shocked the authorities when she paid an unexpected visit here in 1948.
CHISTYE PRUDYPARK
(Чистые пруды MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Chistoprudny bul; mChistye Prudy)
Clean Ponds is the lovely little pond that graces the Boulevard Ring at the ul Pokrovka intersection. The Boulevard Ring is always a prime location for strolling, but the quaint pond makes this a particularly desirable address. Paddle boats in summer and ice skating in winter are essential parts of the ambience. Buy a coffee, find a bench or sit on the grass, and watch the world go by.
Nearby on the boulevard, a little square with fountains and a monument to Kazakh poet Abay Kunanbayev became the unlikely venue of antigovernment protests in 2013. The little-known cultural figure became a protest icon, his face reproduced in graffiti art and on T-shirts.
SAKHAROV CENTREMUSEUM
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-623 4401; www.sakharov-center.ru; ul Zemlyanoy val 57; h11am-7pm Tue-Sun; mChkalovskaya)F
South of Kursky vokzal, by the Yauza River, is a small park with a two-storey house containing a human-rights centre named after Russia's most famous dissident. Inside is a museum recounting the life of Sakharov, the nuclear-physicist-turned-human-rights-advocate, detailing the years of repression in Russia and providing a history of the courage shown by the dissident movement. Free English-language tours are available on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday; book in advance.
The centre holds numerous presentations and debates on contemporary political and human-rights issues.
The park is dotted with unusual sculptures, most built from weapons and other military-industrial waste. Look out for a piece of the Berlin Wall that has been repurposed into a poignant display. Temporary exhibitions cover current human-rights issues and contemporary art.
YELOKHOVSKY CATHEDRALCHURCH

Built between 1837 and 1845, the Church of the Epiphany in Yelokhovo has been Moscow’s senior Orthodox cathedral since 1943. With five domes in a Russian eclectic style, the cathedral is full of gilt and icons, not to mention worshippers kneeling, polishing and lighting candles. In the northern part is the tomb of St Nicholas the Miracle Worker.
A shrine in front of the right side of the iconostasis contains the remains of St Alexey.

IZMAYLOVO

Never mind the kitschy faux 'tsar's palace' it surrounds, Izmaylovsky Market ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.kremlin-izmailovo.com; Izmaylovskoye sh 73; h10am-8pm; mPartizanskaya) is the ultimate place to shop for matryoshka dolls, military uniforms, icons, Soviet badges and some real antiques. Huge and diverse, it is almost a theme park, including shops, cafes and a couple of not terribly exciting museums.
Serious antiquarians occupy the 2nd floor of the wooden trade row surrounding the palace, but for really good stuff you need to come here at an ungodly hour on Saturday morning and compete with pros from Moscow galleries. Keep in mind that Russia bans the export of any item older than 100 years. Feel free to negotiate, but don’t expect vendors to come down more than 10%. This place is technically open every day, but many vendors come out only on weekends, when the selection is greater.
But the famous flea market is only part of the area that includes shops, restaurants, museums and monuments, all contained within a mock ‘kremlin (Кремль в Измайлово GOOGLE MAP ; www.kremlin-izmailovo.com; Izmaylovskoe sh 73; h10am-8pm; mPartizanskaya)’, complete with walls and towers that make a great photo op. Within the kremlin walls, the place recreates the workshops and trade rows of an old settlement. As well as the Vodka History Museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.vodkamuseum.ru; Izmaylovskoe sh 73; admission R200; h10am-8pm; mPartizanskaya), other museums in the complex also include the Russian Costume & Culture Museum and a small Toy Museum. Kremlin in Izmaylovo is a 10-minute walk from Partizanskaya metro station along a plaza lined by high-rise hotels.
Nearby at a branch of the Central Museum of Armed Forces, Stalin's Bunker (Бункер Сталина GOOGLE MAP ; www.cmaf.ru; Sovietskaya ul 80; tours for 1/2/3 people R5000/2500/2000 per person; hby appointment only; mPartizanskaya) was built under a sports stadium in the late 1930s in anticipation of the conflict with Germany. It was later designated the ‘command centre of the Supreme commander-in-chief of Red Army’. You must make advance arrangements for a group tour of the facility, which includes the command room, dining room, an elegant marble meeting hall, and Stalin’s office and living area.

This museum houses the private collection of Russian art patron Mikhail Abramov. He has personally amassed a collection of more than 4000 pieces of Russian and Eastern Christian art, including some 600 icons. The collection is unique in that it represents nearly all schools of Russian iconography. Highlights include Simon Ushakov’s 17th-century depiction of the Virgin Odigitria and an icon of St Nikolai Mirlikiisky.

On a quiet side street near Taganskaya pl, a nondescript neoclassical building is the gateway to the secret Cold War–era communications centre. The facility was meant to serve as the communications headquarters in the event of a nuclear attack. As such, the building was just a shell, serving as an entryway to the 7000-sq-metre space 60m underground. Now in private hands, the facility has been converted into a sort of a museum dedicated to the Cold War.
Unfortunately, not much remains from the Cold War days. The vast place is nearly empty, except for a few exhibits set up for the benefit of visitors, such as a scale model of the facility. Visitors watch a 20-minute film about the history of the Cold War, followed by a guided tour of the four underground ‘blocks’. Call beforehand to sign up for a tour.

(Культурный центр Высоцкого MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.vysotsky.ru; Nizhny Tagansky tupik 3; R150; h11am-6pm Tue & Wed, Fri-Sun, 1-9pm Thu; mTaganskaya)
Part museum, part performance space, part art exhibit, this cultural centre pays tribute to local legend Vladimir Vysotsky (1938–80). Singer and songwriter, poet and actor, Vysotsky was one of the Soviet Union’s most influential pop-culture figures, thanks mostly to the witty lyrics and social commentary in his songs. The permanent exhibit features a slew of photos and documents, as well as personal items, such as the bard’s guitar.
RUBLYOV MUSEUM OF EARLY RUSSIAN CULTURE & ARTMUSEUM

On the grounds of Andronikov Monastery, the Rublyov Museum exhibits icons from days of yore and the present. Unfortunately, it does not include any work by its acclaimed namesake artist, though it is still worth visiting, not least for its romantic location. Andrei Rublyov, the master of icon painting, was a monk here in the 15th century. He is buried in the grounds, but no one knows quite where.
In the centre of the monastery grounds is the compact Saviour’s Cathedral, built in 1427, the oldest stone building in Moscow. The cluster of kokoshniki (gables of colourful tiles and brick patterns) is typical of Russian architecture from the era. To the left is the combined rectory and 17th-century Moscow-baroque Church of the Archangel Michael; to the right, the old monks’ quarters house the museum.

(Новоспасский монастырь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-676 9570; www.spasnanovom.ru; Verkhny Novospassky proezd; h7am-7pm; mProletarskaya)F
Novospassky Monastery, a 15th-century fort-monastery, is about 1km south of Taganskaya pl. The centrepiece of the monastery, the Transfiguration Cathedral, was built by the imperial Romanov family in the 1640s in imitation of the Kremlin’s Assumption Cathedral. Frescoes depict the history of Christianity in Russia, while the Romanov family tree, which goes as far back as the Viking Prince Rurik, climbs one wall. The other church is the 1675 Intercession Church.
Under the riverbank, beneath one of the towers of the monastery, is the site of a mass grave for thousands of Stalin’s victims. At the northern end of the monastery’s grounds are the brick Assumption Cathedral and an extraordinary Moscow-baroque gate tower.

(Старообрядческая Община GOOGLE MAP ; http://starove.ru/rogozhskoe/sloboda/; ul Rogozhsky posyolok 29; h9am-6pm Tue-Sun; mRimskaya/Ploshchad Ilyicha)
One of Russia’s most atmospheric religious centres is the Old Believers’ Community, located at Rogozhskoe, 3km east of Taganskaya pl. The Old Believers split from the main Russian Orthodox Church in 1653, when they refused to accept certain reforms. They have maintained the old forms of worship and customs ever since. In the late 18th century, during a brief period free of persecution, rich Old Believer merchants founded this community, which is among the most important in the country.
The yellow, classical-style Intercession Church contains one of Moscow’s finest collections of icons, all dating from before 1653, with the oldest being the 14th-century Saviour with the Angry Eye (Spas yaroe oko), protected under glass near the south door. The icons in the deesis row (the biggest row) of the iconostasis are supposedly by the Rublyov school, while the seventh, The Saviour, is attributed to Rublyov himself.
Visitors are welcome at the church, but women should take care to wear long skirts (no trousers) and headscarves. There is a popular cafeteria in the premises. To reach the community, take marshrutka 340 to Staroobryadcheskaya ulitsa stop from metro Rimskaya.

LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
IZMAILOVSKY PARK & ROYAL ESTATE

Across a lake from the Izmaylovsky Market, Izmailovsky Park is a former royal estate developed by Peter the Great's father, Tsar Alexey Mikhaylovich. Its 15 sq km contain a recreation park and a much larger expanse of woodland (Izmailovsky Lesopark) east of Glavnaya alleya (the road that cuts north–south across the park). Trails wind throughout, making it a good place to escape the city by hiking or biking.
Tsar Alexey had an experimental farm here in the 17th century, where Western farming methods and cottage industries were sampled. It was on the farm ponds that his son Peter learned to sail in a little British boat, sparking his dream of creating the Russian navy and conquering the seas.
Past an extensive 18th-century barracks is the beautiful five-domed 1679 Intercession Cathedral, an early example of Moscow baroque. The nearby triple-arched, tent-roofed Ceremonial Gates (1682) and the squat brick bridge tower (1671) are the only other original buildings remaining.

A brainchild of famous Georgian film director Rezo Gabriadze, this is much more than just another Caucasian restaurant. It faces the charming Aptekarsky Ogorod gardens for starters, and the interior design – combining naive art with antiques brought from Georgia – is superb. Food is a mixture of Georgian and European. To avoid disappointment, stick to the former.
Also adding to the awesome atmosphere is the live music – mostly piano and some other jazzy ensembles – performed every night.

A carnivore stronghold, Yuzhane (which means 'the Southerners') gets its meat from the Kuban area in southern Russia, hence the name. The chef's philosophy is to utilise every bit of an animal's body, so in addition to juicy steaks, the menu features all kinds of by-products. The southern theme is backed by seafood and a wealth of vegetables, including meaty tomatoes.

It's a blessing when one of the most revered Georgian eateries in town is also one of the cheapest. The object of worship here is khinkali – large, meat-filled dumplings – but the traditional vegie starters are also great. The rather inevitable downside is that the place is constantly busy and there is often a queue to get in.

Come here to celebrate Odessa, affectionately called 'mama' by the residents of this port city. What mama cooks is a wild fusion of Jewish, Ukrainian and Balkan foods, with a strong emphasis on Black Sea fish. It's like island hopping – from forshmak (Jewish herring pate) to Ukrainian borsch and eventually to fried Odessa gobies.
If seafood is not your thing, try Ukrainian Vareniki dumplings or Greek meatballs. Also worth checking out – for cultural as much as gastronomical reasons – are makarony po-flotski (navy-style pasta), a classic Soviet staple, filling locals with nostalgia for the good old times.

The vast majority of Georgian restaurants focus on the most popular, tried-and-true fare, such as shashlyk (meat kebabs) and khinkali (dumplings). This classy place goes far beyond these, listing less well-known delicacies with almost encyclopaedic meticulousness.

Occupying what looks like an abandoned classroom in its Winzavod premises, this easygoing cafe has hip, likeable waiters, an intriguing list of lemonades as well as alcoholic drinks, and a Hemingway portrait hanging above the bar that contributes to the slightly devil-may-care atmosphere.
TSIFERBLATANTICAFE
(Циферблат MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-962-964 6786; www.domnadereve.ziferblat.net; ul Pokrovka 12 str 1; 1st hour R180, subsequent hours R120; h8.30am-midnight Mon-Thu, till 6am Fri, Sat, 10am-midnight Sun; W; mKitay-Gorod)
How often do you head to a cafe just because you need somewhere nice to spend some time in, not because you are desperate to get a coffee? Tsiferblat was the first establishment in Moscow that turned the idea of a coffee shop upside down. Here you pay for time, while coffee, as well as lemonade and cookies, are free.
They call it an 'anticafe'. Looking like an old flat, this place is good for chatting with friends or for fiddling with your gadgets, but it might be slightly too noisy if you need to do some real work. Enter at the back of the building, then walk to the 2nd floor.
CHAYNAYA VYSOTATEAHOUSE
(Чайная высота MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://cha108.ru/; ul Pokrovka 27 str 1; W; mChistye Prudy)
Tearoom? Gelateria? This place looks more like an academic library of tea and ice cream, an impression enhanced by it sharing premises with a bookstore. The tea menu is an endless list of pu'ers and oolongs, while ice-cream flavours represent everything that grows in the former USSR – from gooseberry or fir-needle juice to chestnuts and Crimean rose petals.
The emphasis is on the most unusual and hard-to-find ingredients, which unfortunately makes the place quite pricey.
CAFE DIDUBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-624 1320; www.cafe-didu.ru; Myasnitskaya ul 24; hnoon-6am; W; mChistye Prudy)
This playful club-cafe invites relaxation and fun with lounge furniture, tantalising cocktails and colourful modelling clay. Containers of pliable play dough are found on each table (right next to the condiments) and the sculpted results are on display all around the restaurant.
If that is not enough to keep you entertained, there are also late-night movies (midnight Sunday to Thursday) and weekend dance parties (11pm Friday and Saturday).
SOLYANKACAFE, CLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-903-745 1313; http://s-11.ru; ul Solyanka 11; h11am-6am; W; mKitay-Gorod)
Solyanka is a historic 18th-century merchant’s mansion that has been revamped into an edgy, arty club. Wide-plank floors, exposed brick walls, leather furniture and funky light fixtures transform the space. By day it’s an excellent restaurant, serving contemporary, creative Russian and European food.
In the evening, the big bar room gets cleared of tables and the DJ spins hip-hop, techno and rave. The music usually starts at 11pm (and so does the face control).
OMG! COFFEECOFFEE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-397 7758; www.omgcoffee.net; Arma, Nizhny Susalny per 5/10; h9am-10pm Mon-Fri, from 11am Sat & Sun; mKurskaya)
This smallish local is very scientific (or in its own words – psychotic) about coffee, which is purchased from trusted roasting specialists and brewed using seven different methods. It also serves delightful gourmet burgers and sandwiches.
SECRETCLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.secret-club.ru; Nizhny Susalny per 7, Bldg 8; h11pm-6am; mKurskaya)
The ‘sliding scale’ cover charge and cheap drinks attract a young, student crowd to this gay nightclub. The earlier you arrive, the cheaper the admission, but if you’re a male aged 18 to 22, it’s free any time. Two dance floors, plus live music or drag shows on weekends.
EDWARD'SPUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ArtPlay, ul Nizhnyaya Syromyatnicheskaya per 10, str 9; h8am-midnight; mChkalovskaya)
Ambushing unsuspecting visitors from its hidden location inside a strategic passage at the ArtPlay converted factory area, Edward's is a tiny but noisy place with a few ales and lagers on tap and typical British pub grub. Great for watching artsy types rushing through the passage.
BEAVERS & DUCKSBAR
(Бобры и утки MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.bobryiutki.ru; Chistoprudny bul 1a; h24hr; mChistye Prudy)
This convivial bar is run by two joyful women who mingle with the punters and invent risqué names for cocktails, which we will not cite here for decency reasons. The place is open round the clock and starts serving breakfasts at 4am, which lures in herds of hungry party animals at the most ungodly hours.
TEMA BARBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-624 2720; www.temabar.ru; Potapovsky per 5; h24hr; mChistye Prudy)
There are too many cocktails to count…but we do know that Tema serves more than 20 different martinis, so that should give you an idea of the extent of the drinks menu. The talented bar staff are sure to serve up something that you like. Popular among both expats and locals, Tema has a fun, friendly and sometimes raucous vibe.
LIGA PAPSPORTS BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-624 3636; www.ligapap.ru; ul Bolshaya Lubyanka 24; h24hr; mTurgenevskaya)
It’s a sports bar, but it sure is a snazzy one. The gorgeous interior features big windows, tiled floors and Gothic arched ceilings, in addition to the 20-plus flat-screen TVs. The centrepiece of the main hall is the huge screen, complete with projector, as well as dramatic auditorium-style seating.
PROPAGANDACAFE, CLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.propagandamoscow.com; Bolshoy Zlatoustinsky per 7; hnoon-6am; W; mKitay-Gorod)
This long-time favourite looks to be straight from the warehouse district, with exposed brick walls and pipe ceilings. It’s a cafe by day, but at night they clear the dance floor and let the DJ do his stuff. This is a gay-friendly place, especially on Sunday nights.
3ENTERTAINMENT

GOGOL CENTRETHEATRE
(Гоголь-центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-262 9214; www.gogolcenter.com; ul Kazakhova 8; mKurskaya)
One of the most talked-about theatres in Moscow is under constant political pressure due to the nonconformist position of its director Kirill Serebrennikov. Gogol Centre is a modern venue that hosts many musical and dance performances as well as cutting-edge drama. The latter is difficult to appreciate without knowing Russian.
PIROGI ON MAROSEYKALIVE MUSIC, CINEMA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://pirogicafe.ru; ul Maroseyka 9/2; h24hr; W; mKitay-Gorod)
If you have ever visited Pirogi’s earlier incarnations, you might be surprised by the club’s slick storefront. Inside, it’s not dark and it’s not grungy. Do not fear, however, as the crucial elements have not changed: decent food, affordable beer, and movies and music every night, all of which draw the young, broke and beautiful.
NEW BALLETDANCE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-265 7510; www.newballet.ru; Novaya Basmannaya ul 25/2; hbox office 11am-7pm; mKrasnye Vorota)
If you can’t stand to see another Swan Lake, you will be pleased to know that the New Ballet performs innovative contemporary dance. This performance art, called ‘plastic ballet’, incorporates elements of classical and modern dance, as well as pantomime and drama. The theatre is tiny, providing an up-close look at original, cutting-edge choreography.
GAZGOLDERLIVE MUSIC
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-741 8383; http://gazgolder.com; Nizhny Susalny per 5 str 26; mKurskaya)
A popular concert venue, associated with a namesake label that's responsible for one of Russia's best-known rap acts, Basta.
7SHOPPING

You'll find a number of quirky shops and commercial galleries at Winzavod and Artplay, and more scattered around Meshchansky district.

KHOKHLOVKA ORIGINALCLOTHING
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://hhlvk.ru; Khokhlovsky per 7; hnoon-10pm; mKitay-Gorod)
This is about the most clandestine fashion store we've ever reviewed. To get in, enter a graffiti-covered courtyard, then look for a small gap between two single-storey buildings on your left – the door is inside the tiny passage. The small showroom displays clothes and accessories produced by dozens of young (but often stellar) Russian designers.
The designs may often seem controversial, but you can rest assured you'll never see anyone wearing the same item back home.
ODENSYA DLYA SCHASTYACLOTHING
(Оденься для счастья MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Pokrovka 31; h11am-9pm; mKurskaya)
This sweet boutique – encouraging shoppers to ‘dress for happiness’ – carries unique clothing by a few distinctive designers, including Moscow native Oleg Biryukov. The designer’s eponymous label features refined styles with long, flowing lines and subdued, solid colours. The tastefulness and elegance exemplify the new direction of Russian fashion.
NAIVNO? OCHEN!HOMEWARES
(Наивно? Очень! MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %499-678 0162; www.orz-design.ru; ArtPlay, ul Nizhnyaya Syromyatnicheskaya per 10; h11am-10pm; mKurksaya)
These folks do a great service selling souvenirs – cups, plates and T-shirts – themed on inspired and whimsical drawings produced by children with special needs. Proceeds go to charities that help them. It's a big deal for a country that lags far behind the West on that front.
MIR KINOMUSIC
(Мир кино MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-628 5145; ul Maroseyka 6/8 str 2; h11am-9pm; mKitay-Gorod)
This tiny shop that sells secondhand vinyl and CDs has a few shelves dedicated to Russian indie music from the 1980s to present. There is also a Korean dumpling shop in the same premises.
COSMOTHEKAPERFUME
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cosmotheca.com; 4-y Syromyatnichesky per 1/8, str 6; h10am-10pm; mKurskaya)
Here you'll find perfume brands that you won't come by in a duty-free shop. All fringe international and Russian perfume producers are welcome, while Dior and the likes are not. The shop is located by the entrance to Winzavod art space.
BIBLIO-GLOBUSBOOKS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %495-781 1900; www.biblio-globus.ru; Myasnitskaya ul 6; h9am-10pm Mon-Fri, 10am-9pm Sat & Sun; mLubyanka)
Moscow’s favourite bookshop is huge, with lots of souvenir books devoted to language, art and history, and a good selection of maps and travel guides. A user-friendly computerised catalogue will help you find what you’re looking for. Just to prove that Russia’s consumer culture can keep up with the best of them, there's a coffee shop on the ground floor.
RUSSKAYA USADBAANTIQUES
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://sundook.ru; ArtPlay, ul Nizhnyaya Syromyatnicheskaya 10 str 9; h11am-7pm Mon-Sat)
One of Moscow's best antiques dealers, this gallery specialises in 19th-century furniture salvaged from the mansion houses of the nobility, most of which were burned down or otherwise destroyed by the Bolsheviks. Quite a fascinating place to visit at ArtPlay, even if you don't intend to buy.
FACTORY-EXPEDITIONSPORTS & OUTDOORS
(Фактория-Экспедиция MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.expedicia.ru; Pevchesky per 6; h10am-7pm; mKitay-Gorod)
For all your hunting expedition needs, head to this tiny shop below the restaurant of the same name. As well as guns, knives, camping equipment and outdoor expedition gear, you’ll also find some strange and scary souvenir items from the great Russian countryside.
MAGAZIN CHAI-KOFEFOOD & DRINKS

In 1894 the old Perlov Tea House was redecorated in the style of a Chinese pagoda. Today this fantastical facade contains the Tea-Coffee Store – a simple name for a place that is filled with coffee beans from Italy, Brazil, Costa Rica and Kenya, and tea leaves from China, India and South Africa.

Transport

ARRIVING IN MOSCOW
Travellers to Moscow will likely arrive by air or train. Flights, cars and tours can be booked online at lonelyplanet.com/bookings.
CLIMATE CHANGE AND TRAVEL

Every form of transport that relies on carbon-based fuel generates CO2, the main cause of human-induced climate change. Modern travel is dependent on aeroplanes, which might use less fuel per per person than most cars but travel much greater distances. The altitude at which aircraft emit gases (including CO2) and particles also contributes to their climate change impact. Many websites offer ‘carbon calculators’ that allow people to estimate the carbon emissions generated by their journey and, for those who wish to do so, to offset the impact of the greenhouse gases emitted with contributions to portfolios of climate-friendly initiatives throughout the world. Lonely Planet offsets the carbon footprint of all staff and author travel.
Air
Most travellers arrive in Moscow by air, flying into one of the city’s four international airports: Domodedovo, Sheremetyevo, Vnukovo or Zhukovsky. The vast majority of international flights go in and out of Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo, both of which are about an hour from the city centre by car or train.
There are Aeroflot outlets all around town:
Aeroflot ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Petrovka 20/1; mChekhovskaya)
Aeroflot ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Kuznetsky most 3; mKuznetsky Most)
Aeroflot ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Pyatnitskaya ul 37/19; mTretyakovskaya)
The three main airports – not yet including Zhukovsky – are accessible by the convenient Aeroexpress Train (%8-800-700 3377; www.aeroexpress.ru; one way R420; h6am-midnight) from the city centre; reduced rates are available for online purchases. Alternatively, order an official airport taxi from the dispatcher's desk in the terminal (R2000 to R2500 to the city centre). You can save some cash by booking in advance to take advantage of the fixed rates offered by most companies (usually from R1500 to R1800 to/from any airport). Driving times vary wildly depending on the traffic.
Sheremetyevo
Sheremetyevo (Шереметьево GOOGLE MAP ; %495-578 6565; www.svo.aero) international airport, 30km northwest of the city centre, is the largest airport in Moscow. The Aeroexpress Train makes the 35-minute trip between Sheremetyevo (located next to Terminal E) and Belorussky vokzal every half-hour from 5.30am to 12.30am.
Domodedovo
Domodedovo (Домодедово GOOGLE MAP ; %495-933 6666; www.domodedovo.ru) international airport, located about 48km south of the city, is Moscow's largest and most efficient international airport. The Aeroexpress Train leaves Paveletsky vokzal every half-hour between 6am and midnight for the 45-minute trip to Domodedovo.
Vnukovo
About 30km southwest of the city centre, Vnukovo (Внуково GOOGLE MAP ; %495-937 5555; www.vnukovo.ru) international airport serves most flights to/from the Caucasus, Moldova and Kaliningrad, as well as domestic flights and a smattering of flights to Europe. The Aeroexpress Train makes the 35-minute run from Kievsky vokzal to Vnukovo airport every hour from 6am to 11pm.
Zhukovsky
Opened in 2016, Moscow's fourth international airport, Zhukovsky (Жуковский GOOGLE MAP ; %495-228 9600; http://zia.aero) is about 40km southeast of Moscow. The new airport mostly serves Central Asian destinations, and it is a hub for Ural Airlines.
Train
Rail riders will arrive at one of Moscow's central train stations: Kievsky or Belorussky vokzal if you’re coming from Europe; Leningradsky vokzal if you’re coming from St Petersburg; Yaroslavsky or Kazansky vokzal if you’re coming from the east; and Paveletsky vokzal if you're arriving from the Volga region or Central Asia.
All of the train stations are located in the city centre, with easy access to the metro. Most taxi companies offer a fixed rate of R400 to R600 for a train station transfer.
Leningradsky Vokzal
Located at busy Komsomolskaya pl, Leningrad Station (Ленинградский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://leningradsky.dzvr.ru; Komsomolskaya pl; W; mKomsomolskaya) serves Tver, Novgorod, Pskov, St Petersburg, Vyborg, Murmansk, Estonia and Helsinki. Note that sometimes this station is referred to on timetables and tickets by its former name, Oktyabrsky (Октябрский).
Belorussky Vokzal
At the top of Tverskaya ul, Belarus Station (Белорусский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://belorussky.dzvr.ru; Tverskaya Zastava pl; W; mBelorusskaya) serves trains to/from northern and central Europe, as well as suburban trains to/from the west, including Mozhaysk and Borodino. This is also where you'll catch the Aeroexpress Train to Sheremetyevo international airport.
Kievsky Vokzal
Located in Dorogomilovo, Kiev Station (Киевский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; www.kievsky-vokzal.ru; Kievskaya pl; W; mKievskaya) serves Kyiv and western Ukraine, as well as points further west, such as Moldova, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, Prague, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia and Greece. This is also where you'll catch the Aeroexpress Train to Vnukovo international airport.
Yaroslavsky Vokzal
The main station for Trans-Siberian trains, Yaroslav Station (Ярославский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://yaroslavsky.dzvr.ru; Komsomolskaya pl; W; mKomsomolskaya) serves Yaroslavl, Arkhangelsk, Vorkuta, the Russian Far East, Mongolia, China and North Korea; some trains to/from Vladimir, Nizhny Novgorod, Kostroma, Vologda, Perm, the Ural Mountains and Siberia; and suburban trains to/from the northeast, including Abramtsevo and Sergiev Posad.
Kazansky Vokzal
Kazan Station (Казанский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://kazansky.dzvr.ru; Komsomolskaya pl; W; mKomsomolskaya) serves trains to/from Kazan and points southeast, as well as some trains to/from Vladimir, Nizhny Novgorod, the Ural Mountains and Siberia.
Paveletsky Vokzal
South of the city Pavelets Station (Павелецкий вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://paveletsky.dzvr.ru; Paveletskaya pl; mPaveletskaya) serves points south, including the Volga region and Central Asia. This is also the departure/arrival point for the Aeroexpress Train to Domodedovo international airport.
GETTING AROUND MOSCOW
Metro
The Moscow Metro is by far the easiest, quickest and cheapest way of getting around Moscow. Plus, many of the elegant stations are marble-faced, frescoed, gilded works of art. The 150-plus stations are marked outside by large ‘M’ signs.
Reliability The trains are generally reliable: you will rarely wait on a platform for more than three minutes. Nonetheless, they do get packed, especially during the city’s rush hours.
Tickets Ediny and Troika cards are sold at ticket booths. Queues can be long, so it’s useful (and slightly cheaper) to buy a multiple-ride ticket.
Maps & Signage Stations have maps of the system at the entrance and signs on each platform showing the destinations. The maps are generally in Cyrillic and Latin script, although the signs are usually only in Cyrillic. The carriages also have maps inside that show the stops for that line in both Roman and Cyrillic letters.
Transfers Interchange stations are linked by underground passages, indicated by perekhod signs, usually blue with a stick figure running up the stairs. Be aware that when two or more lines meet, the intersecting stations often (but not always) have different names.
Moscow Central Ring Operated by Russian Railways, the new ring line complements the existing metro system and is good for moving between such far-flung attractions as Izmaylovsky Market, the Botanical Gardens and Moscow International Business Centre.
Taxi
Taxi cabs are affordable. Unfortunately, you can't really flag down an official metered taxi in the street and most taxi drivers and dispatchers do not speak English. That said, mobile phone apps are common and easy to use.
The most popular mobile phone app for ordering taxis is Yandex.Taxi (Яндекс.Такси https://taxi.yandex.com). The interface is available in English, and you provide all details (like departure point and destination address) via the app.
Citymobil (%495-500 5050; www.citymobil.com)
Detskoe Taxi (Детское Такси %495-765 1180; www.detskoetaxi.ru) ‘Children’s Taxi’ has smoke-free cars and car seats for your children.
Lingo Taxi (www.lingotaxi.com) Promises English-speaking drivers (and usually delivers).
New Yellow Taxi (Новое жёлтое такси %495-940 8888; www.nyt.ru)
Taxi Blues (%495-925 5115; www.taxi-blues.ru)
Boat
For new perspectives on Moscow’s neighbourhoods, fine views of the Kremlin, or just good, old-fashioned transport, a boat ride on the Moscow River is one of the city’s highlights. Capital Shipping Co offers a two-day pass, so you can get on and off wherever you wish.
The main route runs between the boat landings at Kievsky vokzal ( GOOGLE MAP ) and Novospassky most ( GOOGLE MAP ), with several stops along the way:
Vorobyovy Gory Landing ( GOOGLE MAP ; Vorobyovskaya nab)
Gorky Park Landing ( GOOGLE MAP )
Krymsky Most Landing ( GOOGLE MAP )
Bolshoy Kamenny Most Landing ( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Ustinsky Most Landing ( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Bicycle
There are more and more bicycles on the streets and pavements of Moscow. Cycling in the centre of Moscow is still a dangerous prospect, as the streets are overcrowded with fast-moving cars and the exhaust fumes are nasty.
That said, the city has launched a campaign to make the city safer for cyclists. As of 2016, there were some 250km of bike lanes, with plans for an additional 500km to be painted in coming years. There are a few parks and other off-road areas that are suitable for pleasure riding, including Gorky Park, Vorobyovy Gory Nature Preserve, Sokolniki and VDNKh.
If you're nervous about navigating the streets on your own (or if you just want some company), Moscow Bike Tours are a great way to see the city by bicycle.
Bike Share
Moscow's new bike-share program is VeloBike (www.velobike.ru), an innovative system designed to cut down on traffic and encourage healthier living in the capital. It started in 2013 and now offers some 2700 bicycles at 350 stations around the city.
AGo online to purchase a membership (R150 for a day, R600 for a month, plus deposit). Now you are ready to roll!
AUse your credit card to unlock a bike at any station, go for a ride, and return your bike to any station. The first 30 minutes incurs no additional charge, but after that you'll pay for use.
AThe system is designed for transportation rather than recreation, so it's a good deal for short rides from point A to point B. For longer rides, you may be better off renting from Oliver Bikes.
GETTING OUT OF TOWN ON YOUR BIKE

ABicycles are not allowed on the metro (with the exception of folding bikes).
AThey are permitted on long-distance trains, but you must buy a special ticket to bring your bike on the elektrichka (suburban commuter train).
ABicycles are allowed on intercity passenger trains as long as your total luggage does not exceed the weight limit (36kg). You should disassemble and package the bike to ensure that you will be able to find space to store it.
AThe Russian Cycle Touring Club (www.rctc.ru) organises weekend rides around Moscow and longer-distance bicycle tours around Russia, including a popular tour of the Golden Ring.
Bus
Buses, trolleybuses and trams might be necessary for reaching some sights away from the city centre. Marshrutki (private buses and minibuses) are particularly useful to reach some destinations on the outskirts of Moscow. Buses can also be useful for a few cross-town or radial routes that the metro misses. In particular, there are several buses that run around the Kremlin Ring (Mokhovaya ul, ul Okhotny Ryad, Teatralyny pr, Staray pl), which is useful for the city centre.
Enter through the first door, with your ticket prepared for validation at the turnstiles (people behind you may get pushy and impatient if you start looking for the ticket in your bag at the last moment). You can travel with Ediny, Troika or TAT cards. If you don't have a ticket, you can buy one or several single-trip Ediny tickets from the driver for R55 per ticket.

White Nights
1In mid-June the sun slumps lazily towards the horizon, but never fully sets, meaning that the magical nights are a wonderful whitish-grey. At this time Petersburgers indulge themselves in plenty of all-night revelry, several arts festivals take place including the spectacular Scarlet Sails (Алые паруса GOOGLE MAP ; http://parusaspb.ru; hJun). Though it’s the busiest time to visit the city, and most hotels are booked up weeks in advance, there’s nothing quite like it, so don’t miss out – even if you come in May or July you’ll be impressed by how late the sun stays out!

The Hermitage
2Perhaps the world’s greatest museum, this iconic establishment’s vast collection is quite simply mind-boggling, with Egyptian mummies, more Rembrandts than the Louvre, and a collection of early-20th-century art that is unrivalled by almost any other in the world. As if this wasn’t enough, your entry ticket allows you to walk around the fascinating apartments and dazzling staterooms of the Romanovs. On top of this, there are still other Hermitage sites: the Winter Palace of Peter I, General Staff Building, Menshikov Palace, Imperial Porcelain factory and the excellent Hermitage Storage Facility.

St Isaac’s View
3No other viewpoint of the historic centre beats the one from the rotunda surrounding the stunning gold dome of St Isaac’s Cathedral, which rises majestically over the uniformly sized Italianate palaces and mansions around the Admiralty. Well worth the climb up the 262 steps, a panorama of the city opens up to you – with fantastic views over the river, the Winter Palace and the Bronze Horseman. The cathedral’s interior is also well worth seeing, with a wonderfully over-the-top iconostasis framed by columns of marble, malachite and lazurite.

Russian Museum
4Even though the Hermitage is unrivalled as St Petersburg’s most impressive museum, that shouldn’t stop you from visiting this superb treasure trove of Russian art, spread out over four stunning palaces in the centre of the city. The main building, the Mikhailovsky Palace, presents a fascinating collection of Russian art from medieval icons to 20th-century avant-garde masterpieces, while the Marble Palace houses a wing of the Ludwig Museum with a focus on contemporary works, and the Stroganov Palace has some of the most spectacular interiors in the city.

Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood
5As much a symbol of the city as the Winter Palace, the spellbinding Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood never fails to impress. The church was built to commemorate the death of Tsar Alexander II, who, in an event that gave the church its unusual name, was attacked here by a terrorist group and later died of his injuries in 1881. Despite its grisly heritage, the glittering, multicoloured onion domes, and intricate interior and exterior mosaics are quite simply stunning, and have to be seen to be believed.

Tsarskoe Selo
6Arguably the most beautiful of the tsarist palace areas that surround St Petersburg, Tsarskoe Selo can be an idyllic place for a day trip. Arrive in good time to see the lavish interiors of the Catherine Palace, including the famous Amber Room, enjoy the gorgeous formal gardens and have a picnic in the landscaped park where Catherine the Great so loved to walk. When it gets impossibly busy at the height of summer, retreat to the nearby scenic estate and palace of Pavlovsk, a beautiful place to escape the crowds.

Mariinsky Ballet
7What could be more Russian than seeing a ballet or opera at the city’s famous Mariinsky Theatre? Formerly known as the Kirov, where Soviet stars such as Nureyev and Baryshnikov danced, the Mariinsky has one of the world's premier ballet troupes as well as a superb orchestra led by artistic director Valery Gergiev. Tickets for productions here are always sought-after, so book online before you travel to ensure you don’t miss out. Even if such performances are not your thing, the historic building is a sight in its own right.

It’s immediately recognisable from its extraordinary golden spire, visible all over the city centre at an incredible (for the 18th century) 122m high. A visit to this large complex is a must for history buffs: here you'll find the tombs of the Romanovs and an excellent history museum; make time, too, for a walk along the ramparts. You can even relax on a surprisingly decent beach with stellar views across to the Strelka and Hermitage!

Cruising the Canals
9St Petersburg is a city that is best appreciated from the water. Despite Peter’s efforts, public boat transport by river and canal never quite caught on in the ‘Venice of the North’. Even so, don't miss a canal-boat tour or, better yet, paddling yourself in a kayak to see some of the city's architectural gems from a different perspective. While cruising the canals is only possible outside the winter months, if you're here when they're frozen over don't miss wandering along their banks for a visual treat.

Taking a Banya
10For a real cultural immersion, head to one of St Petersburg's bani (steam baths), such as the classy Degtyarniye Baths, for the detox of a lifetime. In between basking in the infernal wet heat of the parilka (steam room), having your toxins removed through a sound birch-twig whipping and then plunging into ice-cold water, this is a great place to relax and chat with locals for whom the weekly banya (steam bath) is considered to be almost a sacred rite.





Arriving in St Petersburg
Pulkovo Airport From St Petersburg's superb airport, an official taxi to the centre should cost between R800 and R1000; if you book one via an app it's likely to be R700. Alternatively, take bus 39 (35 minutes) or 39A (20 minutes) to Moskovskaya metro station for R35, then take the metro from Moskovskaya (Line 2) all over the city for R45.
Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal) Easy connection to the nearby pl Vosstaniya (Line 1) and Mayakovskaya (Line 3) metro stations.



Travel at Night
Public transport in St Petersburg shuts down some time after midnight, meaning that taxis and walking are your only options for getting around. There's also the issue of some bridges over the Neva River rising nightly between April and November. This means that if you want to cross the river late at night you need to plan accordingly. Now that there is the Western High Speed Diameter highway it's always possible to get from one side of the Neva to the other, although it will involve a possibly long taxi ride across this toll road.




Top Itineraries

Day One
Historic Heart

MBegin your first day by taking a stroll down Nevsky pr, the city’s central avenue that connects the Hermitage to the Alexander Nevsky Monastery at the far end. Start at Ploshchad Vosstaniya, cross the lovely Fontanka, drop into the Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood and the Kazan Cathedral and end up at the dazzling ensemble of Palace Square, the Winter Palace and the General Staff Building. Wander along the embankment to the Summer Garden and then wander back along the Moyka River.
5Lunch Dine with adorable cuddly toys at cosy Zoom Café.

Sennaya & Kolomna

RContinue along the Moyka to St Isaac’s Cathedral, visit the astonishingly elaborate interiors and then climb to the top of the dome for superb views of the city. Follow the Moyka down to the Yusupov Palace and the Mariinsky Theatre, ending up at the beautiful sky-blue Nikolsky Cathedral.
5Dinner Enjoy the antique atmosphere and vegetarian dishes of Idiot.

Historic Heart

NIf the dive bars of Dumskaya ul don't appeal, Apotheke Bar is a convivial spot for cocktails nearby. Alternatively the Belle View rooftop bar at the Kempinski Hotel Moyka 22 does indeed offer superb views.
Top Itineraries

Day Two
Historic Heart

MAfter a hearty breakfast, head to the Hermitage and get ready for a day of artistic exhilaration. Choose which parts of the collection you want to see, though leave some room for on-the-spot decision making – the exhibition is so enormous that you’ll inevitably discover something new. As well as the art, don’t miss the staterooms, and allow yourself plenty of rest stops to avoid exhaustion.
5Lunch Savour some excellent Russian cuisine at Yat.

Historic Heart

RYou may still want to spend a few hours in the museum and make the most of your day ticket. But if you leave and still have some energy, wander along before picking up a sightseeing cruise around the canals – the best way to sightsee without having to do any more walking!
5Dinner Enjoy a pre- or post-theatre meal at The Répa.

Sennaya & Kolomna

NIf you’ve booked ahead, dress up to spend the evening watching a ballet from the classical repertoire of the Mariinsky Theatre. Even if you haven’t booked, it’s usually quite possible to do so last minute in one of the other theatres in town. For a late-night drink with live jazz drop by Hat.

Day Three
Petrograd & Vyborg Sides

MThis is your chance to explore the beautiful Petrograd Side. Start with a visit to the Peter & Paul Fortress to see where the city began, wander past the mosque and perhaps drop in to see either Peter’s Cabin or the very interesting Museum of Political History. Wander down Kamennoostrovsky pr to take in the Russian Style Moderne architecture.
5Lunch Enjoy great views over the Neva at Koryushka.

Vasilyevsky Island

RAfter lunch, walk across to Vasilyevsky Island, and wander the historic ensemble around the Strelka.

5Dinner Dine in understated Russian elegance at Restoran.

Smolny & Vosstaniya

NHead south to happening Vosstaniya to gallery-, bar- and gig-hop around Ligovsky pr. See some new artwork at Loft Project ETAGI and, if it's summer, enjoy a drink in the sand and some table football at Dyuni.
Top Itineraries

Day Four
Around St Petersburg

MHead out of the city early to spend the day in tsarist opulence. Go first to Tsarskoe Selo in order to visit the Catherine Palace and have a walk in the gardens. If you’re still wanting more, head for Pavlovsk, a quick bus ride away, where the park is even wilder and more beautiful.
5Lunch Eat at White Rabbit in the town of Pushkin.

Historic Heart

RReturn to the city in the afternoon and slot in the Russian Museum, the perfect complement to the Hermitage. This spectacular (and far more manageable) museum showcases seven centuries of Russian art from church icons to the avant-garde.
5Dinner Settle in for a wonderful set meal at EM restaurant.

Smolny & Vosstaniya

NBar hop from ul Rubinshteyna north along the Fontanka, sneaking into the secret bar Commode, followed by Union and Terminal Bar. Catch a live band at Fish Fabrique, Cosmonaut or alternative favourite Griboyedov for a taste of what's cooking on the local music scene.




Walking Tours
There is no shortage of walking tours in St Petersburg, the chief advantage of which is getting a local's perspective on the city. Even though distances are long, walking is a great way to discover courtyards, gardens, quirky sights and side streets that you might otherwise miss. Some operators will provide transport for walking tours as well, meaning that greater areas can be covered. Some highly recommended operators include:
Peterswalk Walking Tours (%812-943 1229; http://peterswalk.com; from R1320) Going for over 20 years, Peter Kozyrev’s innovative and passionately led tours are highly recommended as a way to see the city with knowledgeable locals. The daily Original Peterswalk is one of the favourites and leaves daily from the Julia Child Bistro at 10.30am from April to end of September. The choice of tours available is enormous and includes a Rasputin Walk and a WWII and the Siege of Leningrad tour.
Sputnik Tours (%499-110 5266; www.sputnik8.com; price varies) This online tour agency is one with a difference: it acts as a marketplace for locals wanting to give their own unique tours of their city. Browse, select a tour, register and pay a deposit and then you get given the contact number of the guide. A superb way to meet locals you'd never meet otherwise.
Placemates (%925 845 3747; http://placemates.ru; prices vary) This online portal connects visitors with locals running a variety of tours and interesting experiences around the city, including access to rooftops such as that of the Singer Building, a visit to a glassmaking factory or to a weaver's. They sometimes run free walking tours starting from Admiralteyskaya metro station.
St Petersburg Free Tour (http://petersburgfreetour.com) The central offering of this tour company is its 10.45am daily free city tour, which departs from the Alexander Column on Palace Square. But the company has plenty of other (not free but still reasonably priced) tours on offer, including metro tours, communist Leningrad and the Hermitage.
VB Excursions (%812-380 4596; www.vb-excursions.com) Offers excellent walking tours with clued-up students on themes including Dostoevsky and Revolutionary St Petersburg. Their ‘Back in the USSR’ tour (R3850 per person) includes a visit to a typical Soviet apartment for tea and bliny.




Outdoor Activities
As the seasons change so do the types of outdoor activities that are on offer. Winter sees Yelagin Island morph into a top location for ice-skating and cross-country skiing. The same location and Krestovsky Island are both good spots to hire bicycles or go in-line skating. For downhill skiing (nothing too challenging as the terrain is fairly flat) there are small ski resorts in a radius of 10km to 20km around the city, including Ohta Park (www.ohtapark.ru), Krasnoe Ozero ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-960 0960; www.krasnoeozero.ru; Korobitsyno) and Tuutari Park ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-380 5062; www.tyytari.spb.ru; Retselya 14; h5-10pm Mon-Fri, 10am-9pm Sat & Sun Dec-Mar).
Warmer weather brings the opportunity for kayaking around the city's canals and rivers. Contact Wild Russia to go further afield to Lake Ladoga for yachting and kayaking, as well as off-road biking, parachuting, quad biking and rock climbing outside the city. You can also charter yachts and motorboats via the agency Solnechny Parus ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-327 3525; www.solpar.ru; 2nd fl, Ligovsky pr 94A; mLigovsky Prospekt).
Or you could hit the beach – there's a city-centre one facing the Neva beside the walls of the Peter & Paul Fortress (this is where people famously sunbathe standing up against the stone walls), or head out of town to lovely Beach Laskovy at Repino.
Spectator Sports



Banya
If you’re looking for a uniquely Russian experience, then head to the nearest banya (steam bath) of which St Petersburg has several, both standard and luxury. Enter the parilka (steam room) stark naked and sit back and watch the mercury rise. To eliminate toxins and improve circulation, bathers beat each other (never too hard!) with a bundle of birch branches, known as veniki. It's actually an extremely pleasant sensation. When you can’t take the heat, retreat. A public banya allows access to a plunge pool, usually filled with ice-cold water. The contrast in temperature is invigorating, energising and purifying.
Best Banyas
Krugliye Bani One of the best spots for a traditional banya; includes a heated open air pool.
Degtyarniye Baths Central, modern and one of the most foreigner-friendly bani.
Mytninskiye Bani The oldest communal banya in the city, heated by a wood furnace.
Palace Bridge Wellness Club Offers several styles of sauna in which to steam away all your stresses.




Travelling to Moscow

Many visitors to St Petersburg combine their trip here with one to Moscow. Russia's two largest cities are superbly well connected to each other, with flights leaving at least every hour, Sapsan express trains during the day, slower overnight trains you can sleep on, and even slower boats.

Air
The following airlines fly direct from Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg to three different Moscow airports. Book in advance and you can get tickets as cheap as R2750 one-way, although normally prices are between R4000 and R7000.
Aeroflot (www.aeroflot.ru) Flies around 20 times a day to Sheremetyevo Airport.
Rossiya Airlines (www.rossiya-airlines.com) Flies to Vnukovo Airport and operates 11 flights per day between the two cities.
S7 Airlines (www.s7.ru) Operates 11 flights per day between St Petersburg and Domodedovo Airport.
UTair (www.utair.ru) Operates four daily flights between St Petersburg and Vnukovo Airport.
Ural Airlines (www.uralairlines.com) Offers two daily flights to Domodedovo Airport.
Boat
Boats from Moscow and elsewhere within Russia arrive at the River Passenger Terminal, which is a short walk away from the Proletarskaya metro station. Leaving the metro, turn right onto pr Obukhovskoy Oborony and it’s five minutes up the road.
Train
All trains to Moscow from St Petersburg depart from the Moscow Station. Take your pick from the overnight sleeper trains or the super-fast Sapsan day trains. All train tickets can be bought online at www.rzd.ru, or from the machines at any station in St Petersburg.
Overnight
There are about 10 overnight trains travelling between St Petersburg and Moscow. Most depart between 10pm and 1am, arriving in the capital the following morning between 6am and 8am. On the more comfortable firmenny trains, such as the Red Arrow (Красная стрела) or Grand Express (ГРАНД ЭКСПРЕСС) a de-luxe sleeping carriage is between R12,800 and R16,400, 1st-class compartment (two-person cabin) around R16,300, while a 2nd-class kupe (four-person cabin) is R2800. Less fancy trains offer 3rd-class platzkartny (dorm-style sleeping carriages) for R1570 and even sitting-only carriages for R890.
If in a sleeping carriage you may have to pay a small amount extra for bed linen, although with some tickets this – and breakfast – is included.
Sapsan
These high-speed trains travel at 200km/h to reach Moscow in around four hours. There are six to eight daily departures. Comfortable 2nd-class seats start at R1300, while super-spacious 1st-class seats run from R5000.






Museums & Galleries

St Petersburg is a city of museums and galleries, famed around the world for its world-class collection at the Hermitage, but also for the stellar Russian Museum and the widely renowned Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. Elsewhere, St Petersburg's smaller institutions focus on everything from the Arctic to zoology, via bread, toys, trams, trains, religion and vodka.

The Big Three
If you're only going to visit three museums, make it a triad of art galleries: the Hermitage, the Russian Museum and the Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. The Hermitage needs no introduction – suffice to say that one of the greatest art collections on the planet should always be top of your must-see list. The lesser-known Russian Museum displays Russian art from the medieval times until the early 20th century and is the perfect counterpoint to the Hermitage's Western Art collection. Finally, though it only opened in 2010, Erarta has established itself as one of world's best collections of modern and contemporary Russian art and should not be missed.
Newer Additions
While many of St Petersburg's most august museums are bastions of tradition, things are being kept fresh and exciting by several newer arrivals. Top of the list are the fabulous galleries at the General Staff Building, a major branch of the Hermitage that's home to a superb collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works by the likes of Monet, Matisse and Picasso. The dazzling Fabergé Museum, in a converted palace on the Fontanka, showcases the apex of Peter Carl Fabergé's jewellery making and features some 1500 of his unique creations including nine Imperial Easter eggs. A rather different tone is set by the exciting Street Art Museum, based on the territory of a laminated plastics factory in the suburb of Okhta. Here the brick and concrete walls act as canvases for celebrated and up-and-coming street artists from across Russia and around the world to create a different themed show each year. An old collection of boats, models and paintings has been rejuvenated by a new location for the Central Naval Museum in Kolomna. Nearby you'll find MISP, the Museum of St Petersburg Art (20th–21st centuries), with regularly changing exhibitions of modern and contemporary works by local artists.
The Best of the Rest
Other smaller and often lesser-known museums that are well worth building into your itinerary include the fascinatingly macabre Kunstkamera, Peter the Great's private cabinet of curiosities (think babies in bottles); the Russian Museum of Ethnography displaying traditional crafts and cultures from across the region; the Museum of Political History in a palace that was home to the famous ballet dancer Mathilda Kshesinskaya; and the excellent complex of museums at the Peter & Paul Fortress, the kernel of 18th-century St Petersburg and home to a good museum covering the city's history.
Art Galleries & House Museums
Some of Russia's most famous artists, including Ilya Repin and Karl Bryullov, trained at the renowned Academy of Arts and the Applied Arts School. Both these schools have galleries open to the public that are well worth checking out. An appreciation of the arts continues to be fostered in the city. You can access the best of modern and contemporary arts at places such as the Kuryokhin Centre, Pushkinskaya 10, the Novy Museum, K-Gallery and Marina Gisich Gallery.
St Petersburg is also a city of literary titans. The flat where Pushkin breathed his last after his fatal duel is preserved as a museum. So too are the former homes of the writers Gabriel Derzhavin, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Vladimir Nabokov and Anna Akhmatova. Each provides some insight into the lives of these famed literary figures as well as a chance to glimpse how Russians lived in the past.
NEED TO KNOW

Opening Days & Hours

Nearly all museums close at least one day a week. This tends to vary, although Monday and Tuesday are the most common days. Be aware that in addition to this, many museums close one day a month additionally for cleaning; it’s worth checking a museum’s website for these details.
Language Issues

Things are getting better but few museums have full signage in English. Audioguides, increasingly available in English, are a great way to understand a collection. Guided tours in English vary enormously in quality and usually need to be booked in advance.
Ticket Prices

As a foreigner you will often be charged a ‘foreigner price’, anything from 50% to 100% more than the Russian price. That said, children, students and pensioners all normally receive discounts on entrance fees, even as foreigners, so it’s always worth asking.

Eating

There has never been a better time to eat out in St Petersburg. The range and quality of food available seem to increase year on year, making stereotypes about Russian food now seem like bizarre anachronisms. Petersburgers have well and truly caught the foodie bug, and while little of good quality is cheap in this town, the choice is now bigger than ever.

Getting Serious About Food
St Petersburg has become a place where good food is prized and defined not by its high price tag but rather by the talents of the chef. Fresh, local ingredients, inventive combinations, the use of herbs and spices (other than the ubiquitous dill) and a wider range of flavours are a fixture on the city’s dining tables, and while there’s still plenty of mediocre food out there, visitors today are truly spoiled for choice. We’ve never had an easier time recommending restaurants. However, good places are rarely the most obvious and it's recommend to reserve for the very best.
Modern Russian
Russian food, it’s fair to say, has an image problem – and if you’re not careful you can easily end up with dill-smothered soups, under-seasoned and over-cooked meats, and salads that are more mayonnaise than vegetable. But fret not: there is great Russian cooking to be had in St Petersburg now – both traditional and contemporary, and increasingly a combination of the two. Russian chefs have been rediscovering their own culinary history and have been slowly moving away from the dozen or so standard offerings that are ubiquitous on the country’s menus. They’re preparing rarer or even forgotten dishes, such as venison and duck cooked in subtle and interesting ways and combined with herbs and fresh, organic vegetables. Economic sanctions on food products from the EU have given a boost to local providers, with places such as Cococo and EM Restaurant making a virtue of farm-to-table dining principles.
Local Chains
St Petersburg has a number of home-grown restaurant and cafe chains that are well worth knowing about as they provide cheap and reliable eating options all over town. Chief among these is the now international pie chain Stolle (Штолле; www.stolle.ru), a near-ubiquitous cafe where delicious, moist savoury and sweet pies are available to eat in and take away. Similar and equally numerous is the chain of bakery cafes Bulochnye F. Volcheka (Булочные Ф. Вольчека; www.fvolchek.ru). A couple of other chains to look out for are coffee-and-cake specialists Bushe (Буше; www.bushe.ru) and Baltic Bread (Балтийский Хлеб; www.baltic-bread.ru), which does good sandwiches and pastries.
International Cuisine
Long gone are the days when international cuisine in St Petersburg was limited to the odd Georgian or Italian place. As Russians have travelled more and experienced more foreign cuisines, their tastes have widened and there's a healthy mixture of non-Russian cuisine available in St Petersburg today, running from Thai and Indian to American and even Lithuanian. Gourmet burgers are hugely popular and there's plenty of excellent French, German, Italian and pan-Asian food on the city's menus – especially sushi (which is rarely that great). More common, however, is the international menu, where Russian dishes, pizza, sushi and noodles all compete side-by-side for your attention. In many cases this means that all four are pretty average, but increasingly there are places that know what they’re doing with multiple cuisines.
Vegetarian Options
There is now a very respectable variety of vegetarian cuisine on offer, both at mainstream restaurants and at an increasing number of meat-free places. Look out for vegetarian chains Troitsky Most and Ukrop, as well as individual restaurants such as Botanika and Samadeva. Some non-vegetarian restaurants that offer plenty of choice for non-meat eaters include Marketplace, Zoom Café and Mamaliga. Fish is widely offered on menus, making an excellent alternative for pescatarians. During the 40 days before Orthodox Easter (veliky post in Russian), many restaurants also offer a Lent menu that is animal-free.

Like a Local
Locals still disappear to their local stolovaya (столовая; canteen) at lunchtime for a supremely cheap and social meal, albeit one that's rarely particularly exciting. These places, hangovers from the Soviet days, are usually signposted in Cyrillic and tend to be located in basements and courtyards, but if you stumble across one (look for the sign столовая), you're normally more than welcome to go in. Experiences don't come much more local than this, and you'll usually find yourself saving plenty of cash if you eat in such places. A sign of their enduring popularity is the recent reinvention of the stolovaya in such guises as Marketplace, Obed Bufet and the chain Stolovaya No 1 Kopeika (Cтоловая No. 1 Kопейка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://st1.one; Nevsky pr 25; mains R25-50, set lunch R99; h24hr; mNevsky Prospekt). These modern, attractive spaces that have taken the essential idea of a stolovaya and translated it into something appealing for the contemporary St Petersburg diner.
Eating by Neighbourhood

AHistoric Heart A scattering of gems among many mediocre places.
ASennaya & Kolomna Location of some of the city’s best restaurants.
ASmolny & Vosstaniya Cool and innovative dining options abound.
AVasilyevsky Island Reasonable selection with a good showing of Caucasus restaurants.
APetrograd & Vyborg Sides Best choices are in Petrograd Side.
NEED TO KNOW

Opening Hours

Nearly all restaurants are open seven days a week, generally from around 11am or noon until at least 11pm. Many restaurants open 'until the last customer' – a fairly nonspecific term that means as long as someone is still ordering, they’ll keep serving.
Reservations

The vast majority of restaurants don’t require reservations, though they can be handy on Friday or Saturday evening or for weekend breakfasts in popular places. Reservations are always recommended if you want to sit in a particular place, for example outside on the terrace.
Service

Service has improved; at fancy places it often veers on the over-attentive. The main problem you’ll have is that most waiting staff’s English is limited.
Tipping

In little cafes and cheap eats, tipping is not expected, though you can easily round up the amount you pay if you’re happy with the service. Anywhere more upmarket will usually expect a 10% tip and some add service to the bill.
English Menus

These are a lifeline for non-Russian speakers and are available in nearly all good restaurants, though they’re often not available in cheaper cafes (and when they are, they are very badly translated). Bring along a sense of humour and adventure!

Neighbourhoods at a Glance

1Historic Heart
Radiating out from the golden spire of the Admiralty towards the Fontanka River, the Historic Heart has plenty of obvious attractions, such as the Hermitage, Russian Museum and the Church on the Spilled Blood, not to mention the city's most famous avenue: Nevsky Prospekt. There are also quirky gems like the Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines and a quartet of lovely parks. This is where you will be spending most of your time in St Petersburg, especially as the area is also blessed with excellent hotels, dining and drinking options.

2Sennaya & Kolomna
These two areas adjoin the Historic Heart and are almost as historic themselves. Sennaya is centred on Sennaya Pl (the Haymarket), a traditionally poor area that was immortalised in Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment and has somehow retained its seedy, down-at-heel air despite a big attempt to redevelop it. Kolomna is the largest of seven islands and a quiet, rather out-of-the-way place, although one steeped in history and great beauty. It contains the world-famous Mariinsky Theatre and more canals and rivers than any other part of the city.
3Smolny & Vosstaniya
This agglomeration of four districts (Smolny, Liteyny, Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya) is also part of the city centre. The Smolny peninsula is a well-heeled residential district dominated by the Smolny Cathedral, while next-door Liteyny is centred on Liteyny pr, a commercial street between the Smolny and the Fontanka River. South of Nevsky pr are Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya. Vosstaniya is the focus of St Petersburg’s underground art and drinking scene, while Vladimirskaya, named after the stunning Vladimirsky Cathedral, is a mercantile district full of shopping, markets and a clutch of quirky museums.
4Vasilyevsky Island
The eastern edge of Vasilyevsky Island (or VO as it's usually shortened to) was originally designed to be the administrative heart of the city under Peter the Great. The plan was never carried out but there's still a concentration of historical sights there, including the Strelka and Kunstkamera. The western side of the island is more industrial, but is also home to the fantastic Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art. Transport fans will be thrilled by the opportunity to tour a couple of submarines and an icebreaker, and by museums devoted to trams and the metro.
5Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
The Petrograd Side is a fascinating place that includes everything from the Peter and Paul Fortress to an impressive clutch of Style Moderne buildings lining its main drag. It also hosts a beautiful mosque, many interesting museums and huge swaths of parkland on the Kirov Islands, the city’s largest green lung. The Vyborg Side is famous for its role in Soviet history and can be a little bleak. That said, a walk around the fascinating postindustrial landscape here will appeal to travellers who have palace fatigue, and a few interesting sights make the trip worthwhile.

Explore the Historic Heart
The Historic Heart is a fast-paced, crowded area that's the commercial and tourist focus of the city. For an unforgettable first impression, head straight to vast Palace Sq: on one side is the Winter Palace, home to the main collection of the Hermitage; on the other, the sweeping grandeur of the General Staff Building, its east wing housing the Hermitage's amazing stash of Impressionist and post-Impressionist works.
From here, cherry-pick your way through the rest of the neighbourhood over a couple of days or so. You could spend one day, for example, touring the excellent Russian Museum and its branches such as the Marble Palace and Stroganov Palace. If you're speedy (and have the stamina for visual overload) then also squeeze into the same day the dazzling Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood and the splendid view from the cupola of St St Isaac's Cathedral. When you need a breather, take a break from the hubbub in the lush Summer Garden or Mikhailovsky Garden.
Nevsky pr, the city’s main avenue, dominates every itinerary, and you’ll find yourself back on its broad, busy pavements throughout your visit, popping in and out of shops such as Kupetz Eliseevs. Spend some time off the main drag, though, to find fascinating contrasts, such as the Asian-feeling outdoor market stalls of Apraksin Dvor. In the evening, find high-class entertainment in the theatres around Ploshchad Iskusstv and Ploshchad Ostrovskogo or head to the clubs and cocktails bars that are often hidden away in unexpected places.
Local Life
AParks The vast Mars Field, Summer Garden, Mikhailovsky Gardens or Alexander Garden are delightful green spaces for taking a breather from sightseeing to enjoy a picnic and do some sunbathing on sunny days.
AFree Art Locals flock to the Hermitage on the first Thursday of each month when entrance is free, although the crowds can be huge!
AHangouts See if the Museum of Soviet Arcade Machines is holding one of its ping-pong DJ nights or if there's a movie screening at the rooftop of Mod Club.
Getting There & Away
AMetro This neighbourhood is served by three metro stations: the interconnecting Nevsky Prospekt (Line 2) and Gostiny Dvor (Line 3), and Admiralteyskaya (Line 5) around the corner from the Hermitage.
ATrolleybus The number 7 bus, which runs the length of Nevsky pr, goes past Palace Sq and then crosses Dvortsovy most to Vasilyevsky Island.
ABus Hop on buses 7, 10, 24, 27, 181 or 191 to save some footwork along Nevsky.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
A great boon for time-challenged visitors, or those wanting to avoid daytime crowds – especially tour and school groups – has been the extension of opening hours until 9pm at least once a week at major city museums and galleries, including the Hermitage (Wednesday and Friday) and the Russian Museum (Thursday).

THE HERMITAGE
The geographic and tourism centrepiece of St Petersburg is one of the world’s greatest art collections and usually most visitors’ first stop in the city, even if it is simply to admire the baroque Winter Palace and the extraordinary ensemble of buildings that surround it. No other institution so embodies the opulence and extravagance of the Romanovs.

The Collection
The Hermitage first opened to the public in 1852. Today, for the price of admission, anybody can parade down the grand staircases and across parquet floors, gawping at crystal chandeliers, gilded furniture and an amazing art collection that once was for the Tsar's court's eyes only.
The main complex consists of five connected buildings – the Winter Palace, the Small Hermitage, the Great (Old) Hermitage (also known as the Large Hermitage), the New Hermitage and the Hermitage Theatre – and is devoted to items from prehistoric times up until the mid-19th century. Impressionist, post-Impressionist and modern works are found in the new galleries of the General Staff Building across Palace Sq.
The Western European Collection, in particular, does not miss much: Spanish, Flemish, Dutch, French, English and German art are all covered from the 15th to the 18th centuries, while the Italian collection goes back all the way to the 13th century, including the Florentine and Venetian Renaissance, with priceless works by Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian. A highlight is the enormous collection of Dutch and Flemish painting, in particular the spectacular assortment of Rembrandt, most notably his masterpiece Return of the Prodigal Son.
As much as you will see in the museum, there’s about 20 times more in its vaults, part of which you can visit at the Hermitage Storage Facility. Other branches of the museum include the Winter Palace of Peter I, further east along the Neva, Menshikov Palace on Vasilyevsky Island, and the Imperial Porcelain factory in the south of the city.
Visiting the Hermitage
The Hermitage is a dynamic institution. Displays change, renovations continue, specific pieces go on tour, and temporary exhibitions occupy particular rooms, displacing whatever normally resides there, so be prepared for slight changes.
The main public entrance is via the courtyard of the Winter Palace off Palace Sq. Groups enter via doors facing onto the Palace Embankment (Dvortsovaya nab).
First-Floor Exhibits
To get here you’ll need to go up to the 2nd floor and then down via the stairs between Rooms 153 and 156 or between Rooms 289 and 288.
Rooms 11–24, 27 & 33: Prehistoric Artefacts
The prehistoric collection at the Hermitage contains thousands of artefacts dating from as far back as the Palaeolithic era (500,000 to 12,000 BC). Most of the items were excavated from different regions of the USSR during the Soviet era. The following are the highlights:
ARoom 12 Carved petroglyphs (dating to 2000 BC) were taken from the northeastern shores of Lake Onega after archaeological expeditions in 1935.
ARooms 13–14 Excavations of a burial mound in the northern Caucasus include the corpse of a nomadic chief, lavishly dressed and covered in jewels.
Rooms 26–32, 38–69: Siberian Antiquities, Central Asia & Caucasus
These excellent galleries present exhibits from Central Asia, Siberia and the Caucasus, dating as far back as the 10th century BC.
ARoom 26 Contains mummified human corpses that are more than 2000 years old, as well as a fantastically reconstructed wooden cart.
ARooms 47–51 Feature impressive 7th- and 8th-century relics from Panjakent in present-day Tajikistan.
ARooms 67-69 Feature art and artefacts of the Golden Horde, which swept through Russia in the 13th and 14th centuries.
Rooms 89–91: Ancient Near East
These rooms house a very impressive collection of cuneiform texts from Babylon and Assyrian limestone reliefs.

Room 100: Ancient Egypt
This large hall houses an incredible collection of ancient Egyptian artefacts uncovered by Russian archaeologists. The display spans the Egyptian era from the Old Kingdom (3000–2400 BC) to the New Empire (1580–1050 BC). There are many painted sarcophagi and tombstones carved with hieroglyphics, as well as a fascinating mummy from the 10th century BC.
Rooms 106–131: Greek & Roman Antiquities
The Hermitage has more than 100,000 items from Ancient Greece and Rome, including thousands of painted vases, antique gemstones, Roman sculpture and Greek gold.
ARoom 107 The Jupiter Hall is a sumptuous space with portraits of sculptors on the ceiling.
ARoom 108 Designed by German neoclassicist architect and painter von Klenze to imitate a Roman courtyard.
ARoom 109 Peter I acquired the sculpture Aphrodite (Tauride Venus) from Pope Clement XI. This piece – a Roman copy of a Greek original – was the first antique sculpture ever brought to Russia.
ARoom 111 Another impressive design by von Klenze, this one was intended to be a library (which explains the philosophers’ profiles).
ARoom 130 Hall of Twenty Columns, containing a fabulous collection of Greco-Roman clay urns.
Second-Floor Highlights
On the 2nd floor you'll find the Hermitage’s unbeatable Western European collection and its grandest state rooms.
Rooms 151–189: Russian Culture & Imperial Apartments
Most of the western wing of the Winter Palace contains the huge collection from ancient Rus (10th to 15th centuries) through to the 18th century, including artefacts, icons, portraits and furniture. Also here are the private apartments of the last tsar, Nicholas II, and the imperial family. Many of these rooms were completed in 1894, and they now show off elaborate 19th-century interiors.
ARooms 151 & 153 This long corridor, broken up by a vast clock, contains portraits of all the Russian tsars from Peter the Great to Nicholas II.
ARooms 155–156 Moorish Dining Room and Rotunda.
ARooms 157–162 The Petrovsky Gallery displays personal effects and equipment used by Peter the Great, as well as some beautiful early-18th-century furniture. Look for the ivory chandelier that was partly built by Peter himself.
ARoom 161 In 1880 there was an attempt on the life of Alexander II in this room. A young revolutionary, Khalturin, planted a bomb in the room below. It killed 11 soldiers when it went off, although the tsar had wandered into another room at the time.
ARoom 178 Nicholas II spent much of his time in this wonderful Gothic library, topped with a sublime walnut ceiling.
ARoom 181 The relatively small and intimate Pompeii dining room.
ARoom 187 The griffin-motif furniture in this palace drawing room dates from 1805.
ARoom 188 This small dining room is where the Provisional Government was arrested by the Bolsheviks in 1917.
ARoom 189 Two tonnes of gorgeous green columns, boxes, bowls and urns have earned this room the name ‘Malachite Hall’, and it is one of the most striking rooms in the entire palace. The handiwork of architect Alexander Bryullov, it was completed in 1839. Three figurines on the wall represent Day, Night and Poetry. This was where the last meeting of the 1917 Provisional Government occurred, on the fateful nights of 25 and 26 October 1917; they were arrested soon after, in the Small Dining Room next door.
Rooms 190–192: Neva Enfilade
These three grand ceremonial halls are often used for temporary exhibitions.
ARoom 190 This Concert Hall was used for small soirées. The enormous ornate silver tomb was commissioned by Empress Elizabeth for the remains of Alexander Nevsky.
ARoom 191 As many as 5000 guests could be entertained in the Great Hall (also called Nicholas Hall). The palace’s largest room was the scene of imperial winter balls.
ARoom 192 This anteroom was used for pre-ball champagne buffets.

Rooms 193–198: Great Enfilade
You’ll find more state rooms here.
ARoom 193 Field Marshals’ Hall is known for its military-themed chandelier and its portraits of seven of Russia’s military leaders.
ARoom 194 The Hall of Peter the Great contains his none-too-comfy throne.
ARoom 195 This gilt Armorial Hall contains chandeliers engraved with the coat-of-arms of all the Russian provinces.
ARoom 197 The 1812 War Gallery is hung with 332 portraits of Russian and allied Napoleonic war leaders.
ARoom 198 St George’s Hall served as the state rooms where the imperial throne used to sit. With white Carrara marble imported from Italy and floors crafted from the wood of 16 different tree species, it is a splendid affair.
Room 204: Pavilion Hall & Hanging Garden
The ceremonial Pavilion Hall is an airy white-and-gold room sparkling with 28 chandeliers and the famous Peacock Clock. The south windows look on to Catherine the Great’s hanging garden (built over the stables), while the north overlooks the Neva. The amazing floor mosaic in front of the windows is a copy of that in the Roman bath of Otricoli (Ocriculum) near Rome.
Rooms 207–238: Italian Art
Covering 30-plus rooms, the Hermitage’s collection of Italian art traverses the 13th to the 18th centuries. The highlights are certainly the works by the Renaissance artists: Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Giorgione and Titian. Look also for Botticelli, Caravaggio and Tiepolo.
ARoom 207 The earliest example in this collection is The Crucifixion, painted by Ugolino di Tedice in the second half of the 13th century.
ARoom 214 Of a dozen or so original paintings by da Vinci that exist in the world, two are here. The very different Benois Madonna (1478) and Madonna Litta (1490) are named after their last owners. For years, the latter was considered lost. However, in 1909, the Russian architect Leon Benois surprised the art world when he revealed that it was part of his father-in-law’s collection.
ARoom 217 Giorgione is one of the most mysterious painters of the Renaissance, as only a few paintings exist that are known for certain to be his work. A portrait of idealised beauty, Judith is said to represent the inseparability of life and death.
ARoom 221 The work of Titian, the best representative of the Venetian school during the 16th century, is featured here: Danaya and St Sebastian are widely accepted as two of his masterpieces.
ARoom 224 Accessed off this room is the Hermitage Theatre; there are lovely views from the connecting corridor over the Neva.
ARooms 226–227: Loggia of Raphael When Catherine the Great visited the Vatican she was so impressed that she commissioned Quarenghi to create this copy of a Vatican gallery; a team of Raphael’s students recreated the master’s murals on canvas. Note the occasional Russification on these versions: the two-headed eagle of the Romanov dynasty replaces the papal coat-of-arms.
ARoom 229 Here you’ll enjoy two pieces by Raphael, The Holy Family and Madonna and Child, as well as many pieces by his disciples.
ARoom 230 Contains the Hermitage’s only piece by Michelangelo, a marble statue of a crouching boy.
ARooms 237–238 These Italian Skylight Halls are bathed in natural light, which highlights the ornately moulded ceilings.
Rooms 239–240: Spanish Art
Ranging from the 16th to the 18th centuries, this collection includes the most noteworthy artists of this ‘Golden Age’ of Spanish painting: Murillo, Ribera and, of course, Velázquez. The collection also includes two remarkable paintings from the 16th century: the marvellous St Peter and St Paul, by El Greco, and St Sebastian Cured by St Irene, by Ribera.
Room 243: Knights’ Hall
Nicholas I started collecting artistic weapons and armaments from around the world. Here is the Western European collection, featuring four impressive 16th-century German knights sitting atop their armoured horses.
Rooms 245–247: Flemish Art
These three rooms dedicated to 17th-century Flanders are almost entirely consumed by three artists: Peter Paul Rubens, Anthony Van Dyck and Frans Snyders.
Rooms 249–254: Dutch Art
Dating from the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch collection contains more than 1000 pieces. The 26 paintings by Rembrandt in Room 254 nearly outshine anything else in these rooms. The collection traces his career, starting with Flora and The Descent from the Cross, which are noticeably lighter but more detailed. His later work tends to be darker and more penetrating, such as the celebrated The Return of the Prodigal Son. Painted between 1663 and 1665, it arguably represents the height of Rembrandt’s mastery of psychology in his paintings. The solemn baroque masterpiece is a moving portrait of unquestioning parental love and mercy.
Rooms 263–268: German Art
This small collection of German art ranges from the 15th to the 18th centuries. Among the earliest works here are five paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder.
Room 271: Great Church
Looking splendid following a major renovation completed in 2014, this Rastrelli-designed chapel is one of the Winter Palace's most dazzling spaces, with a white and gilt dome and the ceiling painting The Ascension of Christ by Pyotr Basin.
Rooms 272–288 & 290–297: French Art & Interiors
These rooms trace the development of French art from the 15th to the 18th centuries, including tapestries, ceramics, metalwork and paintings. Look for rooms devoted to Nicholas Poussin, founder of French classicism, and Claude Lorrain, master of the classical landscape. Room 282, Alexander Hall, is a testament to the victory over Napoleon in 1812.
Rooms 298–301: British Art
These rooms showcase 15th- to 18th-century British art. Highlights include:
ARoom 298 Portrait of a Lady in Blue, by Thomas Gainsborough, perhaps the most famous piece in the English collection.
ARoom 300 The Infant Hercules Strangling the Serpents by Sir Joshua Reynolds, which was commissioned by Catherine the Great to symbolise the growing strength of Russia.
Third-Floor Highlights
Access to Rooms 314–332, some of which are used for temporary exhibitions, is via stairs off Rooms 269 or 280 on the 2nd floor. The Far East, Central Asia and Islamic Near East collections are reached via the stairs off Rooms 302 or 156 also on the 2nd floor.
Rooms 351–391: Oriental & Middle Eastern Culture & Art
Art from the Far East, including China, Japan, Tibet, Indonesia, Mongolia and India, can be found in rooms 351 to 376. Rooms 381 to 391 have some wonderful works from Byzantium and Iran including fantastic early 19th-century portraits of Fat'h Ali Shah by Mihr' Ali. Room 391 provides a panoramic view across the Neva from the northwest corner of the Winter Palace.
TREASURE GALLERY

For lovers of things that glitter and the applied arts, the Hermitage's Treasure Gallery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-571 8446; www.hermitagemuseum.org; Winter Palace, Dvortsovaya pl; tour of Diamond or Golden Rooms R350; mAdmiralteyskaya) should not be missed. These two special collections, guarded behind vault doors, are open only by guided tour, for which you should either call ahead to reserve a place, or buy a ticket at the entrance. The Golden Rooms collection focuses on a hoard of fabulous Scythian and Greek gold and silver from the Caucasus, Crimea and Ukraine, dating from the 7th to 2nd centuries BC; the Diamond Rooms section has fabulous jewellery from Western Europe and pieces from as far apart as China, India and Iran.
HERMITAGE TIPS

AAvoid possibly long entrance queues by buying your ticket online. The printed-out voucher or PDF on a wi-fi–enabled device is valid for 180 days.
AAlternatively pay at the computerised ticket machines in the main entrance courtyard and be sure to wait for your tickets to be printed at the end of the transaction (they come after the payment receipt).
AIf you leave jackets and bags in the cloakroom, be aware that you can’t go back for anything without leaving the museum.
AHandbags, small shoulder bags and plastic bags are allowed in the Hermitage, but backpacks aren’t.
AThere is good provision of toilets throughout the Hermitage – don’t make the rookie mistake of thinking that those at the foot of the Jordan Staircase as you enter are the only ones available, as the lines (especially for women) can be very long indeed.

TAKING A BREAK

Eating options in the Hermitage are not great, limited to busy self-serve cafes on the ground-floor corridor between the foot of the Jordan staircase and Room 100.
Yat serves excellent Russian food in a charming atmosphere but a booking is advisable.
If you want to escape the crowds, head to Rooms 1 to 65 on the 1st floor which contain prehistoric relics as well as treasures from Siberia, Central Asia and the Caucasus. Due to the layout of the museum, you have to go up to the 2nd floor and then back down the stairs on the left side of the main entrance to get here. Because of this, you’ll find you have many of the galleries down here almost entirely to yourself.
JORDAN STAIRCASE

The main staircase of the Winter Palace – a magnificent creation of Bartolomeo Rastrelli – was originally known as the Ambassadorial Staircase. However, in the 19th century it became known as the Jordan Staircase as every year on 6 January the imperial family would descend these stairs to the Neva River for the celebration of Christ’s baptism in the River Jordan.
RUSSIAN ARK

Wander with a ghost through 33 rooms of the Hermitage and 300 years of Russian history in Russian Ark (2002). Director Alexander Sokurov shot the movie in one continuous 96-minute take in the Winter Palace.
Rooms 289 and 304–308 comprise the private apartments of Tsar Alexander II. Most spectacular is Room 304, the Golden Drawing Room, which features a fabulous gilt ceiling and a marble fireplace with an intricate mosaic over the mantle.
PEACOCK CLOCK

The centrepiece of the Pavilion Hall (Room 204) is the incredible Peacock Clock, created by James Cox and gifted to Catherine the Great in 1781 by Grigory Potemkin. A revolving dial in one of the toadstools tells the time: as it strikes the hour the automaton peacock spreads its wings and the toadstools, owl and cock come to life. A video beside the clock shows the action in close-up detail should you not be around for the once-weekly performance at 7pm on Wednesday.

GENERAL STAFF BUILDING
The east wing of this magnificent building, wrapping around the south of Palace Sq and designed by Carlo Rossi in the 1820s, marries immaculately restored interiors with contemporary architecture to create a series of galleries displaying the Hermitage's amazing collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist works. Contemporary works are displayed here, too, often in temporary exhibitions by major artists.

New Grand Enfilade
Entry to the galleries is via a new marble staircase, which doubles as an amphitheatre for musical performances. On the 1st floor a 'New Grand Enfilade' of lofty exhibition rooms has been created by throwing a glass ceiling over the building's interior courtyards. Among the giant works on display here are Ilya and Emilia Kabakov's Red Wagon installation and the restored 19th-century German and Austrian canvases from the Steiglitz Mansion on the English Embankment.
Off this central corridor are smaller galleries for temporary exhibitions as well as a beautifully restored trio of rooms that once housed the Imperial Russian Ministry of Finance.
The Art of Empire
Continuing up to the 2nd floor you find the following rooms:
ARooms 300–302 Contain a small collection of pieces by Carl Fabergé.
ARooms 307–316 French 19th-century painting and sculpture including Jean-Léon Gérôme's sultry Pool in a Harem which was stolen from the Hermitage in 2001 only to be mysteriously returned five years later.
ARooms 317–330 Beautifully decorated state rooms overlooking Palace Sq with art and decorative arts from 19th-century Russia; in Room 329 there's an amazing costume worn by Alexander I for an initiation ceremony.
ARooms 333–338 Once occupied by Russian Foreign Ministry.
ARooms 340–352 Nineteenth-century Western European art including works by Caspar David Friedrich.
Impressionists & Post-Impressionists
The 3rd-floor galleries house the Hermitage's collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings, arguably the best in the world. Much of this artwork was displayed for the first time in the 1990s, when the museum revealed some fabulous pieces, kept secret since seizure by the Red Army from Germany at the end of WWII.
Start with the following rooms:
ARoom 403 Monet's early piece Lady in a Garden and his late-career masterpiece Waterloo Bridge, Effect of Mist (1903).
ARooms 407 & 408 Renoir's celebrated Portrait of the Actress Jeanne Samary (1878) and the iconic Child With a Whip (1885).
ARoom 410 Cézanne's Mont Sainte-Victoire, Lady in Blue and The Smoker.
ARooms 411 & 412 Works by Gauguin including the primitive works that he created in Tahiti.
ARoom 413 Van Gogh's Thatched Cottages (1890) and the dreamy Memory of the Garden at Etten (1888).
Barbizon School
Next to Room 452 (where you'll find three sculptures by Rodin) is a series of unnumbered rooms displaying works from the Barbizon School, named for the village in France where this group of artists settled. They were reacting against romanticism, the prevailing school of art for the earlier part of the 19th century, and making a move towards realism. Gustave Courbet, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Théôdore Rousseau and Jean-François Millet are all represented.
Russian Avant-Garde
Russian avant-garde art is not a strong point of the Hermitage (if this is what you're looking for, try the Russian Museum). That said, the General Staff Building does display a couple of Kandinsky’s early works in Room 444 along with Kazimir Malevich's Black Square (1915), the most striking painting of the Petrograd avant-garde. Malevich created several variants of the simple black square against a white background throughout his career, of which this is the fourth and last. It was taken by many as a nihilistic declaration of the ‘end of painting’, causing both awe and outrage.
20th Century
Rooms 430 to 440 are where the big guns of the Hermitage's 20th-century works are shown. On display are over 40 paintings by Matisse and almost as many by Picasso. Henri Matisse was initially classified as a Fauvist, but he continued to paint in his own particular style, even as Fauvism declined in the early 20th century. Around this time, Matisse met Pablo Picasso and the two became lifelong friends. Picasso is best known as the founder and master of cubism, but again his work spanned many styles.
A turning point for Matisse – and perhaps his most famous work – is The Dance (1910). The intense colours and the dancing nudes convey intense feelings of freedom. This panel – along with the accompanying The Music – was painted specifically for Russian businessman Sergei Shchukin. While these panels are certainly commanding, don’t miss The Red Room and Portrait of the Artist’s Wife.
Picasso’s blue period is characterised by sombre paintings in shades of blue. When he was only 22, he painted The Absinthe Drinker, a haunting portrait of loneliness and isolation. The sensuous Dance of the Veils (1907) and Woman with a Fan (1908) are excellent representations of his cubist work, as are the ceramics on display here.
BLACK SQUARE

Kazimir Malevich’s Black Square went missing during the Soviet period, mysteriously reappearing in southern Russia in 1993. Oligarch Vladimir Potanin bought the painting for $US1 million and donated it to the Hermitage in 2002.
Inspired by romanticism, a group of painters in the 1860s began experimenting with painting modern life and landscapes, endeavouring to capture the overall effect of a scene instead of being overly concerned with details. The new trend – radical in its time – was known as Impressionism.

RUSSIAN MUSEUM
Focusing solely on Russian art, from ancient church icons to 20th-century paintings, the Russian Museum's collection is magnificent and can easily be viewed in half a day or less. The collection is less overwhelming than that of the Hermitage, but the masterpieces nonetheless keep on coming as you tour the Mikhailovsky Palace and the attached Benois Wing.

The Museum's Collection
Mikhailovsky Palace was designed by Carlo Rossi and built between 1819 and 1825. It was a gift for Grand Duke Mikhail (brother of Tsars Alexander I and Nicholas I) as compensation for missing out on the throne. Nicholas II opened it as a public gallery on 7 March 1898.
The museum originated from the collection begun by Tsar Alexander III, whose bust greets you on the magnificent main staircase. The collection now numbers around 400,000 pieces (the Russian Museum also manages several other palaces, plus the Mikhailovsky and Summer Gardens). On display are a superb range of ancient icons, paintings, graphic art, sculpture, and folk, decorative and applied art. The collection of avant-garde works is particularly notable, including pieces by Nathan Altman, Natalya Goncharova, Kazimir Malevich and Alexander Rodchenko.
The museum’s Benois Wing houses pieces from the 20th century as well as temporary exhibitions. It was constructed between 1914 and 1919 and is connected to the original palace. It is accessible through an entrance on nab kanala Griboyedova.
Visiting the Russian Museum
Enter the Mikhailovsky Palace's lower floor to the right of the main facade. Pick up a museum map before ascending the magnificent main staircase to the 1st floor, as this is where the chronological ordering of the exhibits from the 10th to the 20th century begins.
Galleries close for restoration and rehangings from time to time, and works are sometimes loaned out, so be prepared for slight changes to the following.
Rooms 1–4: Religious Icons
The first four rooms of the museum encapsulate a succinct but brilliant history of Russian icon painting, including work from the three major schools of Russian icon painting: Novgorod, Muscovy and Pskov. Room 2 has St Nicholas the Miracle Worker with Life, while Room 3 features Russian master Andrei Rublev’s massive paintings of the apostles Peter and Paul as well as his Presentation. Room 4 is notable in its departure from earlier styles. Compare Old Testament Trinity with Scenes from Genesis (c. 1408) with the completely atypical Our Father (1669).

Rooms 5–7: Petrine & Post-Petrine Art
Peter the Great was a great patron of the arts and almost single-handedly brought the Western eye to Russian painting, as witnessed by the massive jump in style from ecclesiastical to secular subjects between Rooms 4 and 5. The rooms include three busts of Peter and two portraits.
Room 6 includes some charmingly odd canvases in very strange shapes as well as mosaic portraits of both Peter and Catherine the Great, as well as of Elizabeth I, Peter’s daughter. The centre of the room is taken up by a huge portrait of the ill-fated Peter III, but look out for the impressive bust of Prince Menshikov. Room 7 has an amazingly ornate ceiling. The room houses a sculpture of Empress Anna with an Arab Boy and a few impressive tapestries, including one that depicts Peter the Great at the Battle of Poltava, his greatest military victory.
Rooms 8–11: Rise of the Academy
These rooms display the early works of the St Petersburg Academy of Arts. These artists borrowed the European classical aesthetic for their work. Look for portraits in Rooms 8 and 10 (including two portraits and a full-sized sculpture of Catherine the Great in Room 10) and biblical themes in Room 9.
Room 11 is the Rossi-designed White Hall, which was Grand Duke Mikhail’s drawing room. Here, the interior is the art – in this case representing the Empire epoch. It’s wonderfully ornate and shiny – a perfect place to host musical greats like Strauss and Berlioz, who performed here.

Rooms 12–17: Dominance of the Academy
By the early 19th century the Academy of Arts was more and more influenced by Italian themes, given the unfashionability of France. In Room 12 look for Vladimir Borovikovsky’s magnificent Catherine II Promenading in Tsarskoe Selo and his Portrait of Murtaza Kuli, his picture of the brother of the Persian Shah. Room 13 is full of paintings of peasant subjects with uplifting titles such as Peeling Beetroot.
Room 14 is truly spectacular, including enormous canvases such as Karl Bryullov’s incredible The Last Day of Pompeii and The Crucifixion, and Ivan Aivazovsky's terrifying The Wave.
Room 15 is also impressive, with the far wall made up of studies for Alexander Ivanov’s masterpiece The Appearance of Christ Before the People (1837–57), which hangs in Moscow’s Tretyakov Gallery. Ivanov spent 20 years on this work, but it was met with a negative critical reception. However, later generations appreciated the work, and even these studies, many of which mark a notable departure in terms of detail and representation.
Rooms 18–22: Genre Painting
At the turn of the 19th century, it became fashionable for ‘genre painting’ to look to themes from (an incredibly idealised) rural Russia, which you can see in Rooms 18 and 20. Room 19 has some beautiful portraits by Ivan Kramskoi, including ones of his daughter Sofia and fellow painter Ivan Shishkin.
Room 21 contains some enormous canvases: Phrina at the Poseidon Celebration in Elesium by Genrikh Semiradsky, Christian Martyrs at the Colosseum by Konstantin Flavitsky and Nero’s Death by Vasily Smirnov. Room 22 is dominated by a huge rendition of Pugachev's Judgement by Vasily Perov.
Rooms 23–24: The Wanderers
In these galleries you'll find works by the Wanderers (Peredvizhniki), a group of Academy artists who saw their future outside the strict confines of that institution. They wandered among the people, painting scenes of realism that had never been seen before in Russian art. Prime examples include Nikolai Perov's animated Hunters at Rest and the Monastery Refectory, a scathing critique of the Church establishment's greed. Also keep an eye out for Pavel Christiakov's serene Jovannina Sitting on Window Sill.
Rooms 25 & 26: Konstantin Makovsky & Nicholas Ghe
Room 25 is devoted to Konstantin Makovsky (1839–1915), who painted the incredibly cinematic Festivity During the Carnival on Admiralty Sq in St Petersburg at the age of just 30. Also a standout is his portrait of his wife Julija.
Ghe’s masterpiece, Peter I Interrogating Tsarevich Alexey in Peterhof, is usually found in Room 26 along with other dark Ghe works such as The Last Supper.
Rooms 27–32: Landscapes & Portraits
Contemporaries of the Wanderers, landscape artists such as Ivan Shishkin were still popular. These rooms also document the rise of populist art, which had a strong social conscience and sought to educate the public. Examples of this are Konstantin Savitsky’s To War (Room 31) and Grigory Myasoyedov's lyrical Harvest Time.
In Room 28 pause to take in the talent of Ukrainian artist Marie Bashkirtseff (1858–84) who died young but not before painting striking portraits, such as Umbrella and the Three Smiles series.
Rooms 33–34: Ilya Repin
Take your time viewing several masterpieces by Ilya Repin (1844–1930), one of Russia’s most famous painters. The iconic Barge Haulers on the Volga is an incredible picture, as is Cossacks Writing a Letter to the Turkish Sultan. There is also his marvellous portrait of a barefoot Leo Tolstoy.
Rooms 35–47: Late-19th-Century Russian Art
These rooms display the large number of contradictory styles that were fashionable in St Petersburg before the explosion of the avant-garde. These include Vasily Surikov, a master of the historical painting that was in vogue in the late 19th century. His portrayals of Yermak’s Conquest of Siberia and Suvorov Crossing the Alps (Room 36) are particularly dramatic, but the lifelike rendition of Cossack rebel Stepan Razin (Room 37) is undoubtedly his most evocative.
Rooms 48–49: Antokolsky’s Sculptures & Folk Art
Mark Antokolsky’s statues Ivan the Terrible and Death of Socrates are on display either side of a souvenir stand. From here you enter the Benois Wing to your right or continue straight ahead for the comprehensive account of Russian folk art, a really lovely display featuring everything from kitchen equipment to giant carved house gables. Room 49 is a long corridor devoted to the museum's history showcasing old photos and posters from past exhibitions.

Rooms 66–71: Early-20th-Century Art
On the 2nd floor of the Benois Wing, the collection moves into the 20th century with works by the father of modern Russian art, Mikhail Vrubel (1856–1910) in Room 66. Some of his groundbreaking works include Epic Hero (Bogatyr) and Flying Demon.
Rooms 67 to 71 include works by an array of important early-20th-century painters including Nikolai Sapunin, Mikhail Nesterov and Boris Kustodiev, whose Merchant’s Wife at Tea is perhaps the most well-known picture here.
Rooms 72–78: Russian Avant-Garde Painting
Between 1905 and 1917, the Russian art world experienced an explosion of creative inspiration that defied the stylistic categorisation that had existed before. Room 72 is home to Nathan Altman’s gorgeous, semi-cubist Portrait of the Poetess Anna Akhmatova, painted in 1914, and it remains one of his most famous works even though Akhmatova apparently didn’t care for it herself. In the same room is Altman’s striking Self Portrait (1911). Room 74 contains primitivist paintings by artist couple Natalya Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov.
Futurism and suprematism, including works by Malevich such as Black Square and Vladimir Tatlin's Counter Relief, can be found in Rooms 75 to 76. Room 77 is devoted to constructivism and features works by Alexander Rodchenko and Vladimir Lebedev. Room 78 displays the bright, ethereal work of Pavel Filonov.
Rooms 80–81: Early Soviet Art
Most paintings from the Stalin era may have been censored beyond meaning, but there are some interesting portraits of daily life here, such as Alexander Samokhvalov’s Militarised Komsomol (1932–33) and various pictures from WWII showing heroic resistance and national unity.
Rooms 82–86: Late Soviet Art
With Stalin gone and the ‘thaw’ under way in the 1950s, Soviet art recovered somewhat from the severity of socialist realism. Idealised images of rural life and peasants still feature very strongly, however. Look for Alexei Sundukov's Queue which captures the failed economy of the times and Dmitry Zhilinsky's The Artist's Family, showing several generations of a family.
Rooms 87–94: Applied & Decorative Art
Works in these galleries range from a beautifully glazed ceramic fireplace by Mikhail Vrubel and other art nouveau–inspired pieces, to Soviet-era porcelain and textiles printed with ingenious patterns made out of tiny tractors or planes.
Rooms 101–109: Temporary Exhibitions
The Russian Museum's temporary exhibitions are hung on the ground-floor galleries either side of entrance to the Benois Wing. To reach these from the 1st floor of the Benois Wing (following your tour of the museum's main collection), use the stairs down off rooms 91 and 92.
OTHER BRANCHES OF THE RUSSIAN MUSEUM

AThe Russian Museum also manages three other impressive palaces in the city centre, where you can view temporary exhibits, permanent collections and grand state rooms: the Marble Palace, the Stroganov Palace and Mikhailovsky Castle.
AOf the palaces, the Marble Palace has the best art collection, while the Stroganov Palace has the best interiors.
ACombined tickets, available at each palace, covers entrance either to your choice of two the same day (adult/student R600/270) or to all four within a three-day period (R850/400).
PETER I INTERROGATING TSAREVICH ALEXEY IN PETERHOF

Ghe's masterpiece captures the tumultuous relationship between Peter the Great and his son Alexey, whom he had imprisoned and tortured to death as he tried to extract information about ‘plotters’ against him. It foreshadows Alexey’s brutal end in the Peter and Paul Fortress. Initially the painting was met with such critical coldness Ghe declared that art should not be for sale, became a follower of Tolstoy, bought a farm and began painting portraits for a pittance so that anyone who wanted one could afford them.

ILYA REPIN

One of Russia's greatest artists, Ilya Repin was born in Chuhuiv, now part of Ukraine. Originally a member of the Wanderers, he outgrew the movement and went on to produce key works of Russian realist and populist art. His masterpiece, Barge Haulers on the Volga, an unrivalled portrait of human misery and enslavement in rural Russia, shows why the early Soviet authorities held him in high regard as a model for the Socialist Realist painters to come.

CHURCH ON THE SPILLED BLOOD
This five-domed dazzler is St Petersburg’s most elaborate church, with a classic Russian Orthodox exterior and an interior decorated with some 7000 sq m of mosaics. Officially called the Church of the Resurrection of Christ, its full colloquial name (Church of the Saviour on the Spilled Blood) references the assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II here in 1881.

Restored Beauty
The church, which was was consecrated in 1907, incorporates elements of 18th-century Russian architecture from Moscow and Yaroslavl, and is so lavish it took 24 years to build and went over budget by 1 million rubles – an enormous sum for the times. Decades of abuse and neglect during most of the Soviet era ended in the 1970s when restoration began. When the doors reopened 27 years later on what is now a museum, visitors were astounded by the spectacular mosaics covering the walls and ceilings. Designs for the mosaics came from top artists of the day including Victor Vasnetsov, Mikhail Nesterov and Andrey Ryabushkin.
The Exterior
The polychromatic exterior – decorated with mosaics of detailed scenes from the New Testament and the coats of arms of the provinces, regions and towns of the Russian Empire of Alexander’s time – is equally showstopping. Twenty granite plaques around the facade record the main events of Alexander’s reign.

ST ISAAC’S CATHEDRAL
Named after St Isaac of Dalmatia, on whose feast day Peter the Great was born, this is one of the largest domed buildings in the world. Most people bypass the museum to climb the 262 steps to the kolonnada (colonnade) around the drum of the dome; the outlook across the city is superb.


akedesign / shutterstock ©
Controversial Design
French architect Auguste de Montferrand began designing the cathedral in 1818. Due partly to technical issues, it took so long to build (until 1858) that Nicholas I was able to insist on an even more grandiose structure than Montferrand had originally planned. More than 100kg of gold leaf was used to cover the 21.8m-high dome alone, while the huge granite pillars on the building’s facade each weigh over 120 tonnes. There’s a statue of Montferrand holding a model of the cathedral on the west facade, although Nicholas I denied the architect his dying wish, to be buried here, considering it too high an honour for a mere artisan.
Interior Decoration
The cathedral’s interior is lavishly decorated with 600 sq m of mosaics, 16,000kg of malachite, 14 types of marble and an 816-sq-m ceiling painting by Karl Bryullov. Look out for some interesting photographs of the cathedral throughout its history, too.

PALACE SQUARESQUARE
(Дворцовая площадь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovaya pl; mAdmiralteyskaya)
This vast expanse is simply one of the most striking squares in the world, still redolent of imperial grandeur almost a century after the end of the Romanov dynasty. For the most amazing first impression, walk from Nevsky pr, up Bolshaya Morskaya ul and under the triumphal arch ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ).
In the centre of the square, the 47.5m Alexander Column (Алексaндровская колонна MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Palace Sq; mAdmiralteyskaya) was designed in 1834 by Montferrand. Named after Alexander I, it commemorates the 1812 victory over Napoleon.
The square’s northern end is capped by the Winter Palace (Zimny Dvorets), a rococo profusion of columns, windows and recesses, topped by rows of larger-than-life statues. A residence of tsars from 1762 to 1917, it’s now the largest part of the State Hermitage Museum.
Curving an incredible 580m around the south side of the square is the Carlo Rossi–designed General Staff Building completed in 1829. The east wing now houses a branch of the Hermitage while the west wing is the headquarters of the Western Military District. The two great blocks are joined by a triumphal arch over Bolshaya Morskaya ul, topped by the Chariot of Glory by sculptors Stepan Pimenov and Vasily Demuth-Malinovsky, another monument to the Napoleonic Wars.
NEVSKY PROSPEKTSTREET
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Nevsky Prospekt is Russia’s most famous street, running 4km from the Admiralty to Alexander Nevsky Monastery, from which it takes its name. The inner 2.5km to Moskovsky vokzal is the city’s shopping centre and focus of its entertainment and street life. Walking Nevsky is an essential St Petersburg experience. If you’re here on a holiday evening (such as 27 May – City Day), the sight of thousands of people pouring like a stream down its middle is one you’ll not forget.
Nevsky Prospekt was laid out in the early years of St Petersburg, as the start of the main road to Novgorod, and soon became dotted with fine buildings, squares and bridges. At the beginning of the 1900s, it was one of Europe’s grandest boulevards, with cobblestone footpaths and a track down the middle for horse-drawn trams. On either side of the tracks were wooden paving blocks to muffle the sound of horse-drawn carriages – an innovation that was a world-first and for which the avenue was dubbed the quietest main street in Europe.
Today, things are quite a bit noisier. The traffic and crowds can become oppressive and, after a while, you’ll find yourself going out of your way to avoid the street.
KAZAN CATHEDRALCHURCH
(Казанский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 4663; http://kazansky-spb.ru; Kazanskaya pl 2; h8.30am-7.30pm; mNevsky Prospekt)F
This neoclassical cathedral, partly modelled on St Peter’s in Rome, was commissioned by Tsar Paul shortly before he was murdered in a coup. Its 111m-long colonnaded arms reach out towards Nevsky pr, encircling a garden studded with statues. Inside, the cathedral is dark and traditionally Orthodox, with a daunting 80m-high dome. There is usually a queue of believers waiting to kiss the icon of Our Lady of Kazan, a copy of one of Russia’s most important icons.
Look for the victorious Napoleonic War field marshal Mikhail Kutuzov (whose remains are buried inside the cathedral) and his friend and aide Mikhail Barclay de Tolly.
The cathedral's design reflects Paul's eccentric desire to unite Catholicism and Orthodoxy in a kind of ‘super-Christianity’ as well as his fascination with the Knights of Malta, of which he was a member.
STROGANOV PALACEMUSEUM
(Строгановский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.rusmuseum.ru; Nevsky pr 17; adult/student R300/150; h10am-6pm Wed & Fri-Mon, 1-9pm Thu; mNevsky Prospekt)
One of the city’s loveliest baroque exteriors, the salmon-pink Stroganov Palace was designed by court favourite Bartolomeo Rastrelli in 1753 for one of the city’s leading aristocratic families. The building has been superbly restored by the Russian Museum, and you can visit the impressive state rooms upstairs, where the Grand Dining Room, the Mineralogical Study and the Rastrelli Hall, with its vast frieze ceiling, are the obvious highlights.
Famously, the Stroganov’s chef created here a beef dish served in a sour cream and mushroom sauce that became known to the world as ‘beef stroganoff’.

This branch of the Russian Museum features temporary exhibitions of contemporary art and a permanent display of paintings from the Ludwig Museum in Cologne that includes works by Picasso, Warhol, Basquiat and Liechtenstein. The palace, designed by Antonio Rinaldi, gets its name from the 36 kinds of marble used in its construction. Highlights include the Gala Staircase, made of subtly changing grey Urals marble; and the impressive Marble Hall, with walls of lapis lazuli and marble in a range of colours from yellow to pink.
Built between 1768 and 1785, the palace was a gift from Catherine the Great to Grigory Orlov for suppressing a Moscow rebellion. Outside it stands the equestrian statue of Alexander III.
SUMMER GARDENPARK
(Летний сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 0374; https://igardens.ru; nab reki Moyki; tours from R1200; h10am-10pm May-Sep, 10am-8pm Oct-Mar, closed Apr; mGostiny Dvor)F
The city's oldest park, these leafy, shady gardens can be entered either at the northern Neva or southern Moyka end. Early-18th-century architects designed the garden in a Dutch baroque style, following a geometric plan, with fountains, pavilions and sculptures studding the grounds. The ornate cast-iron fence along the Neva side was a later addition, built between 1771 and 1784.
The gardens functioned as a private retreat for Peter the Great (his modest Summer Palace ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812 314 0374; Muzey Letny Dvorets Petra 1), closed for renovations, is here) before becoming a strolling place for St Petersburg’s 19th-century leisured classes. Only in the 20th century were commoners admitted.
Tours can be booked in advance or at the Teahouse which is the best of several cafes to be found in the gardens and which occasionally hosts music concerts on summer evenings.
The 92 marble statues, busts and sculptural groups that decorate parts of the garden are replicas: the 18th-century originals are housed in the Mikhailovsky Castle.
MIKHAILOVSKY CASTLEMUSEUM
(Михайловский замок MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-595 4248; www.rusmuseum.ru; Sadovaya ul 2; adult/student R300/150; h10am-6pm Mon, Wed & Fri-Sun, 1-9pm Thu; mGostiny Dvor)
A branch of the Russian Museum, the castle is worth visiting for its temporary exhibits as well as a few finely restored state rooms, including the lavish burgundy and gilt throne room of Tsar Paul I’s wife Maria Fyodorovna.
Rastrelli’s original fairytale wooden palace for Empress Elizabeth was knocked down in the 1790s to make way for this bulky edifice, a bizarre take on a medieval castle, quite unlike any other building in the city.
The son of Catherine the Great, Tsar Paul I, was born in the wooden palace and he wanted his own residence on the same spot. He specified a defensive moat as he (quite rightly) feared assassination. But this erratic, cruel tsar only got 40 days in his new abode before he was suffocated in his bedroom in 1801.
In 1823 the palace became a military engineering school (hence its Soviet-era name, Engineer’s Castle, or Inzhenerny Zamok), whose most famous pupil was Fyodor Dostoevsky.
MIKHAILOVSKY GARDENPARK
(Михайловский сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://igardens.ru; h10am-10pm May-Sep, 10am-8pm Oct-Mar, closed Apr; mNevsky Prospekt)F
Administered by the Russian Museum, these 8.7-hectare gardens are lovely and offer an impressive perspective of Mikhailovsky Castle. They are famous for their Style Moderne wrought-iron fence and gates, a profusion of metallic blooms and flourishes that wrap around one side of the Church on the Spilled Blood.
BRONZE HORSEMANMONUMENT
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Senatskaya pl; mSadovaya)
The most famous statue of Peter the Great was immortalised as the Bronze Horseman in the epic poem by Alexander Pushkin. With his horse (representing Russia) rearing above the snake of treason, Peter’s enormous statue was sculpted over 12 years for Catherine the Great by Frenchman Etienne Falconet. Its inscription reads ‘To Peter I from Catherine II – 1782’.
Many have read significance into Catherine’s linking of her own name with that of the city’s founder: she had no legitimate claim to the throne and this statue is sometimes seen as her attempt to formalise the link (philosophical, if not hereditary) between the two monarchs. The significance of the inscription in both Latin and Cyrillic alphabets would not have been lost on the city’s population, which was still in the process of Westernisation during Catherine’s reign.
Despite completing his lifework here, Falconet departed Russia a bitter, angry man. Years of arguing with the head of the Academy of Fine Arts over the finer details of the sculpture had taken its toll, and he didn’t even bother staying for the unveiling.
It’s tradition for local newlyweds to be photographed here after their weddings, so expect to see plenty of jolly wedding parties.
RUSSIAN MUSEUM OF ETHNOGRAPHYMUSEUM
(Российский Этнографический музей MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-570 5421; www.ethnomuseum.ru; Inzhenernaya ul 4/1; adult/student R300/100, treasure room R250; h10am-9pm Tue, 10am-6pm Wed-Sun; mGostiny Dvor)
This excellent museum displays the traditional crafts, customs and beliefs of more than 150 cultures that make up Russia’s fragile ethnic mosaic. It’s a marvellous collection with particularly strong sections on the Jews of Russia, Transcaucasia and Central Asia, including rugs and two full-size yurts (nomads’ portable tent-houses). Galleries are accessed either side of the magnificent 1000-sq-m Marble Hall, flanked by rows of pink Karelian-marble columns, in which events and concerts are held.
You need to buy an extra ticket to view the treasure room, which has some great weapons and rare devotional objects.
WINTER PALACE OF PETER IMUSEUM

Excavations beneath the Hermitage Theatre in the late 1970s revealed remains of the principal residence of Peter the Great, including a large fragment of the former state courtyard, as well as several suites of palace apartments. Some rooms have been restored to their appearance during Peter’s era, complete with Dutch tiles and parquet floors, and are used to exhibit some of Peter’s personal items from the Hermitage collection.
The cobbled courtyard has one of Peter’s official carriages and a sledge. In the last room before you leave, don't miss the wax effigy of Peter made by Bartolomeo Rastrelli after the tsar died in the palace in 1725.
ADMIRALTYARCHITECTURE
(Адмиралтейство MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Admiralteysky proezd 1; mAdmiralteyskaya)
The gilded spire of the Admiralty is a prime St Petersburg landmark, visible from Gorokhovaya ul, Voznesensky pr and Nevsky pr, as all of these roads radiate outwards from this central point. From 1711 to 1917, this spot was the headquarters of the Russian navy; now it houses the country’s largest military naval college and is closed to the public.
The building itself was reconstructed between 1806 and 1823 to the designs of Andreyan Zakharov. With its rows of white columns and its plentiful reliefs and statuary, it is a foremost example of the Russian Empire style. Get a close look at the globe-toting nymphs flanking the main gate. Despite the spire’s solid-gold appearance, it’s actually made from wood and was almost rotted through before restoration efforts began in 1996.
ALEXANDER GARDENPARK
(Александровский сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Admiralteysky pr; mAdmiralteyskaya)F
Laid out from 1872 to 1874, these pleasant gardens, named after Alexander II, wrap around the Admiralty and are mentioned in Pushkin's famous verse novel Eugene Onegin as a fashionable place for a stroll. They remain so, dotted with statues of Glinka, Lermontov, Gogol and other cultural figures, as well as a fountain that dates to 1879. Opposite St Isaac's there's a very good children's playground within the garden.
PUSHKIN FLAT-MUSEUMMUSEUM

Alexander Pushkin, Russia’s national poet, had his last home here on one of the prettiest curves of the Moyka River. He only lived here four months, and died here after his duel in 1837. The little house is now the Pushkin Flat-Museum, which has been reconstructed to look exactly as it did in the poet’s last days. You can only visit on a tour (run hourly on the hour), given in Russian only.
On display are his death mask, a lock of his hair and the waistcoat he wore when he died.

This gallery showcases rotating exhibitions of photography, videography and other mixed media drawn from across Russia and around the world. It’s definitely one of the best spaces for seeing contemporary photographic work in St Petersburg. Note the beautiful stained-glass windows on the stairwell of the handsome building the gallery is located in, which housed an insurance company before the revolution.
The gallery's well-stocked art bookshop and pleasant cafe are also worth a look.
ST PETERSBURG STATE MUSEUM OF THEATRE & MUSICMUSEUM

This museum is a treasure-trove of items relating to the Russian theatre including model sets, posters and costumes. You'll have to buy separate tickets to its three sections, the best of which is the Legends of St Petersburg exhibition (R150). Also worth a look is the gallery devoted to the painter, scenery and costume designer Leon Bakst (R100).
A section aimed at children (R80) has great models of the Mariinksy stage and antique contraptions used to create effects like the sound of wind, rain and trains.

Karl Bulla (1853–1929) was one of the city's most famous photographers and is immortalised in a life-sized statue ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Malaya Sadovaya ul; mGostiny Dvor) on Malaya Sadovaya ul. Around the corner, his studio is still in operation at the top of this building where there's also a gallery of evocative black-and-white images of the city, shot by Bulla and his sons in the late 19th and early 20th century, alongside photographic portraits of the likes of the imperial family, Tolstoy and Chaliapin.

In the very same building that housed the tsarist and the Bolshevik secret police offices, this small museum recounts the history of this controversial institution and includes one room that recreates the office of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Cheka (Bolshevik secret police). Each of the remaining three rooms is devoted to the secret police during a different period of history: the tsarist police, the Cheka and the KGB.
Exhibitions are heavy on photographs and documents, but some of them are fascinating. Some explanatory materials are available in English.
MARS FIELDPARK
(Марсово поле MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab Lebyazhey kanavki; mNevsky Prospekt)
Named after the Roman god of war and once the scene of 19th-century military parades, the grassy Mars Field is a popular spot for strollers, even though in the early 20th century it was used as a burial ground for victims and heroes of the revolution. At its centre, an eternal flame ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) has been burning since 1957 in memory of the victims of all wars and revolutions in St Petersburg.
LUTHERAN CHURCHCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 0798; www.petrikirche.ru; Nevsky pr 22; h9am-9pm; mNevsky Prospekt)F
Tucked in a recess between Bolshaya and Malaya Konyushennaya uls is this lovely church, in the Romantic-Gothic style, built for St Petersburg’s thriving German community in the 1830s. It's distinguished by a four-column portico and topped with a discreet cupola. Concerts are also held here, including free ones when the church organ is played.
There's an exhibition in the upstairs gallery about the city's German population and the church, which during Soviet times housed a swimming pool (the high diving board was placed in the apse).
BRODSKY HOUSE-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей-квартира И.И. Бродского MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.nimrah.ru/musbrod; pl Iskusstv 3; adult/student R300/100; hnoon-7pm Wed-Sun; mNevsky Prospekt)
This is the former home of Isaak Brodsky, Repin’s favourite student and one of the favoured artists of the revolution (not to be confused with Joseph Brodsky, one of the least-favourite poets of the same regime). Besides being a painter himself, Brodsky was also an avid collector, and his house-museum contains his collection of thousands of works, including lesser-known paintings by top 19th-century artists such as Repin, Levitan and Kramskoy.
ARMENIAN CHURCH OF ST CATHERINECHURCH

Continuing with a tradition of non-Orthodox churches being built on Nevsky pr, the Armenian merchant Ovanes Lazarian paid for the city’s first Armenian church to be erected here in 1771. Designed by German architect Georg Veldten and completed in 1780, the church's intimate interior was destroyed during Soviet times, but has since been restored.
PLOSHCHAD OSTROVSKOGOSQUARE
(Площадь Островского MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mGostiny Dvor)
Created by Carlo Rossi in the 1820s and 1830s, this square is named for Alexander Ostrovsky (1823–86), a celebrated 19th-century playwright. An enormous statue of Catherine the Great ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Ostrovskogo) (1873) stands amid the chess, backgammon and mah-jong players who crowd the benches here. At the Empress’ heels are renowned statesmen of the 19th century, including her lovers Orlov, Potemkin and Suvorov.
The most prominent building on the square is Rossi’s neoclassical Alexandrinsky Theatre.
The square’s west side is taken up by the National Library of Russia ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-310 7137; www.nlr.ru; pl Ostrovskogo 1/3; h9am-9pm Mon-Fri, 11am-7pm Sat & Sun; W; mGostiny Dvor).
PLOSHCHAD LOMONOSOVASQUARE
(Площадь Ломоносова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mGostiny Dvor)
Named after the great scientist Mikhail Lomonosov, this small square forms the southwestern end of the Carlo Rossi–designed ensemble and is the best spot from which to admire the ideal symmetrical proportions of ul Zodchego Rossi: the buildings on this street are 22m wide, 22m apart and 220m long.
The Vaganova School of Choreography at No 2 is the Mariinsky Ballet’s training school, where Pavlova, Nijinsky, Nureyev and others learned their art.
From the square you can also admire Most Lomonosova, a stone drawbridge (no longer functioning) dating from 1787 with four Doric pavilions that housed the drawbridge mechanism.
PLOSHCHAD ISKUSSTVSQUARE
(Площадь Искусств MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mNevsky Prospekt)
In the 1820s and 1830s, Carlo Rossi designed Ploshchad Iskusstv (Arts Square), named after the cluster of museums and concert halls that surrounds it, and the lovely Mikhailovskaya ul, which joins the square to Nevsky pr. There is invariably a pigeon perched atop the statue of Pushkin ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Iskusstv), erected in 1957, which stands in the middle of the tree-lined square.
VORONTSOV PALACEHISTORIC BUILDING
(Воронцовский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Sadovaya ul 26; mGostiny Dvor)
Opposite Gostiny Dvor, this palace (1749–57) is another noble town house by Rastrelli. From 1810 it was the most elite military school in the empire and is still used as a military school for young cadets. The palace is occasionally opened for concerts and such, details of which are posted out the front.
ANICHKOV PALACEPALACE
(Аничков дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 9555; www.anichkov.ru; Nevsky pr 39a; mGostiny Dvor)
Built between 1741 and 1751, with input from a slew of architects, including Rastrelli and Rossi, the Anichkov Palace is now officially known as the St Petersburg City Palace of Youth Creativity. It's the location for over 1000 hobby classes and after-school clubs for the city's children. There’s a small museum inside, but it is only open sporadically for tours.
The palace was twice a generous gift for services rendered: Empress Elizabeth gave it to her favourite Count Razumovsky and later Catherine the Great presented it to Potemkin. This was also Tsar Nicholas II’s favourite place to stay in St Petersburg – he far preferred the cosy interiors to the vastness of the Winter Palace.
PETROVSKAYA AKVATORIASHOWROOM
(Петровская Акватория MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-933 4152; www.peteraqua.ru; Malaya Morskaya ul 4/1; adult/child R400/200; h10am-10pm; mAdmiralteyskaya)
For an idealised view of what parts of St Petersburg looked like back in the early 18th century, this interactive model village is a small revelation. The scaled models of the Peter and Paul Fortress, Vasilyevsky Island, Peterhof, Oranienbaum etc are incredibly detailed with moving horse and carriages and sailing ships.
The ensemble is laid out to reflect the four seasons and lit for both night and day. You'll find it on the 6th floor above the metro entrance.
CHURCH OF THE SAVIOUR NOT MADE BY HUMAN HANDSQUARE
(Храм Спаса Нерукотворного Образа на Конюшенной Площади MAP GOOGLE MAP ; 1 Konyushennaya pl; h9am-7pm; mNevsky Prospekt)
On the north side of Stables Sq, this church – named after a legendary Byzantine icon – is where Pushkin's funeral service was held in 1837. The square was where the imperial court once kept its horses and transportation.

Giving new meaning to 'back in the USSR', this 'museum' is sure to be one of the most entertaining ones you will visit in St Petersburg. Admission includes a stack of 15 kopek coins used to operate the 50-odd game machines in its collection, which date to the Brezhnev era.
Have great fun joining local kids and their nostalgic parents as they play games such as Morskoi Boi (Battleships), table ice hockey and Repka, based on a Russian fable about pulling a giant radish out of the ground!
There's a pleasant cafe here too and at least once a month they host late-night DJ parties when ping-pong tables are rolled out to add to the fun.

TOP SIGHT
FABERGÉ MUSEUM
The magnificently restored Shuvalovsky Palace is home to the world's largest collection of pieces manufactured by the jeweller Peter Carl Fabergé (including nine Imperial Easter eggs) and fellow master craftspeople of pre-revolutionary Russia.
Fabergé founded his jewellery business in St Petersburg in 1842. At its height he employed 700 people across many factories and in four shops in Russia and one in London. The tradition of tsars giving their wives jewelled Easter eggs began in 1885 when Alexander III commissioned the 37-year-old Fabergé to create a present for his Danish wife Maria Feodorovna. From 1897, the new tsar Nicholas II asked the jeweller to continue making the eggs for his mother, now the Dowager Empress, and his own wife Alexandra Feodorovna.
As dazzling as these brilliant baubles are, they are just a prelude to a series of other lavishly decorated halls in which thousands of other pieces are displayed, including silver tea services, enamelled and jewelled cigarette cases and belt buckles, jade bowls and Russian Impressionist paintings. Look out for pieces by Fyodor Rückert, whose cloisonné enamel work is highly distinctive and beautiful.

Cococo has charmed locals with its inventive approach to contemporary Russian cuisine. Your food is likely to arrive disguised as, say, a small bird's egg, a can of peas or a broken flowerpot – all rather gimmicky, theatrical and fun. The best way to sample what it does is with its tasting menu (R2900). Bookings are advised.
Every Thursday at 7pm the chef pushes out the boundaries with a special 10-course tasting menu (R5000). If that all sounds too much, consider popping in here for a pleasant breakfast: the space doubles as the in-house restaurant of the W Hotel.

If this doesn't appeal, the hotel also has a lovely winter garden for meals and afternoon tea and the gentleman's-club-like Xander bar, with a double-sided central fireplace – the perfect place to hole up on a wintery night.

Historic Heart

START DVORTSOVAYA PL
END KUPETZ ELISEEVS
LENGTH 2KM; THREE HOURS
Approach the magnificent 1Palace Square on Dvortsovaya pl, from Bolshaya Morskaya ul. Turning the corner from Nevsky pr, behold the 2Alexander Column, perfectly framed under the triumphal arch with the 3Winter Palace as its elaborate backdrop. Turn right at the square's northeast corner to find the colossal 4Atlantes holding aloft the portico of the New Hermitage.
At the Moyka River, cross to the eastern bank using either span of the 5Pevchesky Most. Head north along the river to the final residence of Russia’s most celebrated poet and now the 6Pushkin Flat-Museum. Around the corner, Konyushennaya pl is dominated by the 18th-century court stables, currently under restoration. In the middle of the complex you can visit the 7Church of the Saviour Not Made by Human Hand where Pushkin's funeral service was held.
Rest for a while in either the 8Mars Field, the former imperial guard parade grounds back over the Moyka River, or in the shady canal-side 9Mikhailovsky Gardens. Revived, you'll now be ready for the spectacular aChurch on the Spilled Blood. There's a spetacular view of the church from bTeatralny most near the intersection of the Moyka and Griboyedov Canal.
Detour off nab kanala Griboyedova to find a statue of Pushkin in the middle of pretty cpl Iskusstv. The square is ringed by celebrated cultural institutions, including the dRussian Museum and eMikhailovsky Theatre.
At the junction of Nevsky pr and nab kanala Griboyedova admire the Style Moderne beauty fSinger Building. It's a whimsical contrast to the formidable gKazan Cathedral opposite. Behind the mammoth church, hBankovsky most is the city’s most picturesque and photographed bridge.
Head up Dumskaya ul to return to Nevsky pr and navigate your way along the exterior vaulted gallery surrounding the iBolshoy Gostiny Dvor, the 18th-century trading arcade still serving shoppers. A short walk east along Nevsky pr is Ploshchad Ostrovskogo, a small park with an impressive jstatue of Catherine the Great and a view the impressive facade of the kAlexandrinsky Theatre. Opposite, you can finish up at one of the cafes at the grand food hall lKupetz Eliseevs.

In an area heavily saturated with hipster cafes, Coffee 22 – with its tattooed baristas and service staff, arty decor (piercing portrait of Joseph Brodsky, a rustic wall of dried mosses) and fashion-forward customers – is perhaps the hippest of them all. Listen to its DJs via its mixcloud.com/coffee22 soundtrack.
oTOP HOPSCRAFT BEER

One of the nicer craft-beer bars in town, this riverside space with friendly staff serves up a regularly changing menu of 20 beers on tap and scores more in bottles.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 1535; http://hatgroup.ru/apotheke-bar; ul Lomonosova 1; h8pm-6am Tue-Sun; mGostiny Dvor)
The antithesis of the nearby dive bars, Apotheke is a calm, cosy cocoon for cocktail connoisseurs. Its slogan is 'think what you drink', so there's no official menu but a friendly young bartender, most likely in a white jacket and sporting a hipster moustache, to make suggestions or simply surprise you.
oKABINETCOCKTAIL BAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-911-921 1944; www.instagram.com/kabinet_bar; Malaya Sadovaya ul 8; h8am-6pm; mGostiny Dvor)

Boroda means beard in Russian, and sure enough you'll see plenty of facial hair and tattoos in this hipster cocktail hang-out. Never mind, as the mixologists really know their stuff – we can particularly recommend their smoked Old Fashioned, which is infused with tobacco smoke, and their colourful (and potent) range of shots.
oMOD CLUBBAR, CLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.modclub.info; nab kanala Griboyedova 7; cover R150-350; h6pm-6am; mNevsky Prospekt)

Gran is a great little neighbourhood cafe that prepares excellent cups by your brew method of choice – Aeropress, Chemex or Hario pour-overs. Of course, if you prefer just a latte or a flat white, the baristas here have you covered. It's a small, raw space with flowers and touches of artwork softening the brick and concrete.
Coffees aside, Gran has waffles, granola and other breakfast fare (served til 4pm), plus panini, bagel sandwiches and desserts.
TEA HOUSETEAHOUSE

CLUB L.U.XCLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-981-972 9342; http://lux-klub.ru; nab kanala Griboyedova 7; h11.30pm-6am Fri & Sat)
One of the city's largest dance clubs offers a hangar-like space hung with crystal chandeliers, wrapped in swathes of satin and gauze and padded with faux leather. Take your pick between popular house music on the main dance floor, and deep-house on the second 'luxury' floor.
VNVNCCLUB

'Abandon hope all ye who enter here,' warns the sign on the door – and it's putting no one off cramming into this popular club that occupies a former chapel in the courtyard area south of the square. In warmer months patrons linger outside where there's a greasy burger bar to help soak up the alcoholic excesses.
KOFE NA KUKHNECAFE
(Кофе на Кухне MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/morecoffee; nab reki Fontanki 13; h8.30am-10pm Mon-Fri, 10am-11pm Sat & Sun; W; mGostiny Dvor)

It's a happening bar, it serves a mean burger and there's a hairdresser at the back – should you fancy a new 'do' part-way through the night. Oh, and there's a fussball table, if conversation lags and you fancy a bit of hand-twisting action.

DOUBLE BCAFE
(ДаблБи MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-928 0818; http://vk.com/doublebspb; Millionnaya ul 18; h9am-10pm Mon-Fri, 11am-10pm Sat & Sun; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)
The young baristas are friendly and take their coffee brewing seriously at this serene hipster hang-out, with specially roasted beans from Ethiopia, Costa Rica and Kenya and methods including Aeropress and drip. They also offer a few artisan teas.
GOLUBAYA USTRITSAGAY
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-921-332 5161; www.boyster.ru; ul Lomonosova 1; h7pm-6am; mGostiny Dvor)
Loud, lewd and lots of fun, this is the coolest gay place in town. Take your pick from the main bar, where the uninhibited crowd is often quite literally hanging from the rafters, the Priscilla Queen of the Desert karaoke bar, or the other upstairs bars and dancefloors.
Meaning Blue Oyster, the bar is named after the leather bar that featured in the 1980s Police Academy movies, but is as unlike it as vinyl is to velvet.
BERMUDY BAR DISCOBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/bar_bermudy; Bankovsky per 6; h6pm-6am; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Resurrecting the time-honoured St Petersburg practice of dancing on the tables, this friendly bar does indeed become more of a disco than a bar after midnight. With low prices, good cocktails, table football and a trashy, fun atmosphere, Bermudy is an anything-goes destination if you want a late night.
W TERRACEBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-610 6155; www.wstpetersburg.com; W Hotel, Voznesensky pr 6; hnoon-1am Sun-Thu, noon-2am Fri & Sat May-Sep; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)
The W's rooftop cocktail bar and terrace offers fantastic city views to be enjoyed over top-notch libations. Bookings are advised for the outdoor space with seating in cosy cabanas and views straight onto St Isaac’s Cathedral.
TANZPLOSHCHADKACLUB
(Танцплощадка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.tancplo.com; Konyushennaya pl 2a; h8pm-6am Fri & Sat; mNevsky Prospket)
Beloved by beautiful young things, this is the dance club of the moment with a shabby-chic indoor space beneath a lofty vaulted brick ceiling and plenty of outdoor space should it get too hot inside. Find it at the back, through the archway and courtyard complex south of Konyushennaya pl.
CENTRAL STATIONGAY
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 3600; http://centralstation.ru; ul Lomonosova 1/28; cover after midnight R100-300; h6pm-6am; mNevsky Prospekt)
Huge, with several bars and dance floors, as well as a men-only dark room, this is a stalwart of the St Petersburg gay scene. There are events on throughout the week. Music is mainly at the pop and house end of the spectrum and there's usually plenty of topless eye-candy gyrating at weekends.
WARSZAWABAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/warszawabufet; Kazanskaya ul 11; h10am-2am Sun-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; mNevsky Prospekt)
Russian urbanites have always harboured a special admiration for the quaint provincialism of Eastern Europe, hence this smallish bar with old-fashioned wallpaper, vintage furniture and portraits of 20th-century Polish film stars. Polish beer is on tap and cocktails are based on liquors you may have never heard of. Good for deep, vodka-infused philosophical conversations.
DACHABAR
(Дача MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/bardacha; Dumskaya ul 9; h6pm-6am; mGostiny Dvor)
This is the joint that kicked off the whole Dumskaya dive-bar scene in 2004. We'd say it's showing its age, but truth is that it was never about keeping up appearances here – just drinking and dancing the night through in a packed-to-the-gills space.
FIDELCLUB
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://vk.com/barfidel; Dumskaya ul 9; h6pm-6am; mGostiny Dvor)
This long-running dive bar is a sort of musical and alcoholic tribute to the ruler who 'outlived six presidents of America and six leaders of the Soviet Union and Russia'.
WITNESS TO HISTORY

Palace Square has been the location for some of the most dramatic moments in St Petersburg's history. On Bloody Sunday (9 January 1905), tsarist troops fired on workers who were peaceably gathered in the square, sparking the 1905 revolution. And it was across Dvortsovaya pl that the storming of the Winter Palace took place during the 1917 October Revolution, an event re-enacted by Lenin and thousands of Red Guards in 1920 and later filmed in 1927 for Sergei Eisenstein's October, commissioned by the government to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.

This illustrious stage delivers the Russian ballet or operatic experience, complete with multitiered theatre, frescoed ceiling and elaborate productions. Pl Iskusstv (Arts Sq) is a lovely setting for this respected venue, which is home to the State Academic Opera & Ballet Company.
It’s generally easier and cheaper to get tickets to the performances staged here than those at the Mariinsky.
oALEXANDRINSKY THEATRETHEATRE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-710 4103; www.alexandrinsky.ru; pl Ostrovskogo 2; tickets R900-6000; mGostiny Dvor)
This magnificent venue is just one part of an immaculate architectural ensemble designed by Carlo Rossi. The theatre’s interior oozes 19th-century elegance and style, and it’s worth taking a peek even if you don’t see a production here.
This is where Anton Chekhov premiered The Seagull in 1896; the play was so badly received on opening that the playwright fled to wander anonymously among the crowds on Nevsky pr. Chekhov is now a beloved part of the theatre's huge repertoire, ranging from Russian folktales to Shakespearean tragedies.
Head through the archway in the southwest corner of the square to find the Alexanderinsky's New Stage.
NEW STAGEPERFORMING ARTS
(Новая сцена MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-401 5341; http://alexandrinsky.ru; nab reki Fontanki 49a; mGostiny Dvor)
The New Stage at Alexandrinsky, which opened in 2013, is a strikingly modern building for the historic city center but one that keeps a low profile due to the architect's ingenious use of glass and a secluded courtyard space. Come here to see contemporary dance, music, film, lectures and other events.
The theatre's roof is also one of the venues for the summer programme of screenings organised by Roof Cinema.
SHOSTAKOVICH PHILHARMONIACLASSICAL MUSIC

Both venues are used for numerous music festivals.

(Кино&Театр Англетер MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-494 5063; www.angleterrecinema.ru; Angleterre Hotel, Malaya Morskaya ul 24; tickets R330; mAdmiralteyskaya)
This cinema inside the Angleterre Hotel is one of the best places in the city to see movies in their original language, with subtitles rather than dubbing. The program, which includes several different features every day, focuses on current art-house releases.
DOM 7JAZZ
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 8250; http://vk.com/dom_7; nab kanala Griboyedova 7; hnoon-midnight Tue-Thu & Sun, noon-5am Fri & Sat; mNevsky Prospekt)

ST PETERSBURG THEATRE OF MUSICAL COMEDYTHEATRE
(Санкт-Петербургский государственный театр музыкальной комедии MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-570 5316; http://web.muzcomedy.ru; Italyanskaya ul 13; tickets from R3800; mNevsky Prospekt)
Dating back to 1929, this theatre, as its name implies, specialises in musical and comedic plays and performances. Over the White Nights tourist season you'll likely find Swan Lake on here. At other times check it out for its high-quality musical productions.
HERMITAGE THEATREBALLET
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-408 1084; https://hermitagetheater.com; Dvortsovaya nab 32; online tickets from R8300; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Designed by Giacomo Quarenghi, this intimate neoclassical auditorium was once the private theatre of the imperial family, and stands on the site of the original Winter Palace of Peter I. Book early if you’d like to see a ballet (usually classics such as Swan Lake and Giselle) at a discount, but still be prepared to pay well over the odds compared to other theatres in the city.
Access to the theatre is via an entrance to the Large (Old) Hermitage on Dvortsovaya nab; look for the door on the southwest side of the stone bridge over the small water channel.
BOLSHOI ST PETERSBURG STATE CIRCUSCIRCUS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-570 5198; www.circus.spb.ru; nab reki Fontanki 3; tickets R500-6000; mGostiny Dvor)
Russia's oldest permanent circus complex (built in 1877) is looking splendid since a recent major renovation. Circus troupes and artists from other cities and countries perform shows here, too.
DOM KINOCINEMA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 5614; www.domkino.spb.ru; Karavannaya ul 12; htickets from R100; mGostiny Dvor)
One of the handful of cinemas in the city where you can see foreign films and some higher-brow Hollywood productions with subtitles, as well as arty Russian movies. It is also where the British Council holds its British Film Festival. Despite a refit, the whole place remains remarkably Soviet in a charming way.
The cinemas are small so book ahead or get here early if there's a film you particularly want to see. In the same building is Rodina, another classy cinema with two screens.
AVRORACINEMA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-315-52-54; www.avrora.spb.ru; Nevsky pr 60; tickets R300-700; mGostiny Dvor)
Opening in 1913 as the Piccadilly Picture House, this was the city’s most fashionable cinema in the early years of Russian film, and it has retained its position pretty consistently ever since. Today most premieres (to which you can nearly always buy tickets) take place here. Foreign films are dubbed into Russian, though sometimes you’ll find the odd subtitled one.
Renamed the more Soviet-sounding Avrora in 1932, it was here that a young Dmitry Shostakovich played piano accompaniment to silent movies.
GLINKA CAPELLA HOUSECLASSICAL MUSIC
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 1058; www.glinka-capella.ru; nab reki Moyki 20; mAdmiralteyskaya)
This historic hall was constructed for Russia’s oldest professional choir, the Emperor Court Choir Capella, founded in 1473. Originally based in Moscow, it was transferred to St Petersburg upon the order of Peter the Great in 1703. These days, performances focus on choral and organ music.

The BDT, which will celebrate its centenary in 2019, has a reputable repertoire and is a good place to see Russian drama. Recently renovated, it is one of the city’s grandest theatres, and its location on the Fontanka River is delightful.
DEMMENI MARIONETTE THEATREPUPPET THEATRE

PRIYUT KOMEDIANTATHEATRE
(Приют комедианта MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-310 3277; www.pkteatr.ru; Sadovaya ul 27/9; htickets R600-1800; mSennaya Ploshchad)
This delightful theatre’s name means ‘the actor’s shelter’ and it does a pretty good job of fulfilling its role, providing refuge for some of the city’s best up-and-coming actors, directors and producers. It was founded by actor Yury Tomashevsky in the late 1980s, when the city turned over a defunct cinema that the group still uses.
Productions are in Russian.
KOMISSARZHEVSKAYA THEATRETHEATRE
(Театр им В.Ф.Комиссаржевской MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-315 5355; www.teatrvfk.ru; Italiyanskaya ul 19; mGostiny Dvor)
Named after Vera Komissarzhevskaya, a great actress who gained her reputation as leading lady in Vsevolod Meyerhold performances during the late 19th century, this theatre is known for its modern treatment of classic plays. Productions are in Russian.
MONUMENT TO ALEXANDER III

‘I don’t care about politics. I simply depicted one animal on another,’ said sculptor Paolo Trubetskoy defending his equestrian statue of Alexander III when it was unveiled in 1909. Originally erected on pl Vosstaniya, the unflattering giant bronze of the stout, unpopular tsar had caused a scandal among St Petersburg society who were divided on its artistic merits. Alexander's son Nicholas II considered shipping it off to Irkutsk, but when rumours started that he wanted to send his dad into Siberian exile, he changed his mind.
In 1937 the statue was removed from pl Vosstaniya and sent to languish in an interior courtyard of the Russian Museum. In post-communist Russia, when the Marble Palace ceased to house the Lenin Museum, the statue was moved to the forecourt there, replacing Lenin's armoured car (which now can be seen at the Artillery Museum).
7SHOPPING

oAU PONT ROUGEDEPARTMENT STORE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://aupontrouge.ru; nab reki Moyki 73-79; h10am-10pm; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Dating from 1906–7, the one-time Esders and Scheefhaals department store has been beautifully restored and is one of the most glamorous places to shop in the city. This glorious Style Moderne building is now dubbed Au Pont Rouge after the Krasny most (Red Bridge) it stands beside. Inside you'll find choice fashions and accessories and top-notch souvenirs.
The restoration included the rebuilding of the glass cupola, destroyed in the 1930s so as not to clutter the view towards the Admiralty down Gorokhovaya ul. On the ground floor there's a branch of the French cafe Patisserie Garçon.
oTAIGAFASHION & ACCESSORIES
(Тайга MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://taiga.space; Dvortsovaya nab 20; h1-9pm; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Like several other of the city's trendy hangouts, Taiga keeps a low profile despite its prime location close by the Hermitage. The warren of small rooms in the ancient building are worth exploring to find cool businesses ranging from a barber to fashion and books. 8 Store is one of the best, a stylish boutique stacked with clothes and accessories by local designers.
Also great for original design gifts and souvenirs is Imenno Lavka.
TYKVAFASHION & ACCESSORIES
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/tykvastore; Bolshaya Konyushennaya ul 9; h10am-10pm; mNevsky Prospekt)
Contemporary Russian designers for both men and women are represented in this stylishly minimalist boutique on the 2nd floor of a grand building that's undergoing something of a revamp as another creative cluster of arty, boho businesses and cafes.
You'll also find branches in the creative clusters of Golytsin Loft and at ul Vosstaniya 24.
MAKER DESIGN LOFTFASHION & ACCESSORIES
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-911-113 4138; www.makerdesignloft.com; Marsovo pole 7; h10am-9pm; mNevsky Prospekt)
Not in the same sprawling, raggedy league as other St Petersburg creative clusters, Maker is really one big shop selling mainly locally designed clothes and accessories, aimed at 'normal people' by which it means its prices are not out of this stratosphere. There's a cafe and a beauty salon here, too.
21 SHOPFASHION & ACCESSORIES
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; https://21-shop.ru; Bolshaya Konyushennaya ul 19/8; h11am-8pm; mNevsky Prospekt)
Pick up a locally designed T-shirt, sweatshirt, bag or other item of streetwear or accessory at this large unisex boutique with its entrance just off Bolshaya Konyushennaya – an affordable antidote to the high fashion of nearby department store DLT.
It also has a branch in the Galeria.
PIF PAF SUPER SHOPFASHION & ACCESSORIES
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-571 7036; nab kanala Griboyedova 31; hnoon-10pm; mNevsky Prospekt)
Next to the cafe-bar of the same name, this is one of the best second-hand fashion stores in the city – it has a good eye for quality labels and a stylish look, but consequently you'll pay more than the average for the goods.

HISTORIC SHOPS OF NEVSKY PROSPEKT

Nikolai Gogol described it as 'Petersburg's universal channel of communication' in his story Nevsky Prospekt. Some 300 years on from its creation, little has changed. Nevsky remains the city's most famous street, running 4.7km from the Admiralty to the Alexandr Nevsky Monastery, from which it takes its name. Taking a stroll along it is an essential St Petersburg experience and particularly special at dusk as the low light casts shadows and picks out silhouettes from the elegant mix of architecture.
The inner 2.5km to Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal) is the city's prime shopping drag that pulses with street life. Here you'll find baroque palaces, churches in a range of denominations, all manner of entertainments and, above all, shops, some historic in their own right. These are the key ones not to miss:
ASinger Building ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 28; mNevsky Prospekt) The former headquarters of the Singer sewing machine company, which opened a factory in the Russian capital in 1904, is one of St Petersburg’s most gorgeous buildings. Its Style Modern architecture, designed by Pavel Suzor, and topped with a glass tower and scuplture, also housed the American consulate for a few years prior to WWI. It's possible to access the offices part of the building including the interior of the glass dome on a tour (R6000 for up to three people) organised with Placemates.
ABolshoy Gostiny Dvor (Большой Гостиный Двор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-630 5408; http://bgd.ru; Nevsky pr 35; h10am-10pm; mGostiny Dvor) One of the world’s first indoor shopping malls, the ‘Big Merchant Yard’ dates from between 1757 and 1785 and stretches 230m along Nevsky pr (its perimeter is more than 1km long). This Rastrelli creation is not as elaborate as some of his other work, finished as it was by Vallin de la Mothe in a more sober neoclassical style. At its height at the turn of the 20th century, Gostiny Dvor contained over 170 shops.
APassage (Пассаж MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-313 7400; http://passage.spb.ru; Nevsky pr 48; h10am-9pm; mGostiny Dvor) Built between 1846 and 1848, this arcade has a glass roof spanning the entire block from Nevsky to Italiyanskaya ul. Dostoevsky wrote a story about a man who was swallowed by a crocodile in Passage, after a live crocodile was exhibited here in 1864. Look for the small exhibition on the 1st floor with historical photos and other items related to the arcade. The handsomely restored ground floor has several good souvenir and antique shops.
AKupetz Eliseevs ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-456 6666; www.kupetzeliseevs.ru; Nevsky pr 56; h10am-11pm; W; mGostiny Dvor) This Style Moderne stunner is St Petersburg's most elegant grocery store. Built in 1904 as the flagship of the Eliseev Brothers' highly successful chain of food emporiums, little expense or design flourish was spared in its construction. In recent years the building has been restored to its full grandeur with huge plate-glass windows providing glimpses into a dazzling interior of stained glass, chandeliers, polished brass and a giant pineapple palm. The building's exterior is no less lavish, graced with four allegorical sculptures representing industry, trade and commerce, art and science. The building also included a theatre, which is still functioning.

History of the Hermitage
When, in 1764, Catherine the Great purchased the art collection of Johann Gotzkowski, which contained a large number of works by Rubens, Rembrandt and Van Dyck, little did anyone suspect that this would form the basis of one of the world’s most celebrated art museums, the repository of millions of artistic masterpieces from around the world.
A New Winter Palace
Some 30 years earlier, it was Empress Anna who engaged a young Bartolomeo Rastrelli to incorporate the existing royal buildings on the Neva into a proper palace. Her successor, the ever-extravagant Empress Elizabeth, wanted something grander so in 1754 she signed a decree ordering the creation of a winter palace, closely supervising its design and construction. Her inopportune death in 1761 occurred only a few months before the Winter Palace was finally completed, but her legacy has been confirmed by what is arguably St Petersburg’s most strikingly beautiful palace.
Visitors and residents were wowed by the capital’s newest addition: ‘visible from a distance, rising above the rooftops, the upper storey of the new Winter Palace, adorned with a host of statues’, as it was described by one 18th-century visitor to the capital. But the palace, of course, was a private residence. After the death of Empress Elizabeth, Peter III lived here for only three months before he was overthrown in a palace coup and replaced by Catherine the Great. This grand baroque building thenceforth became the official residence of the imperial family.
The Imperial Art Collection
Collecting art was an obsession for Catherine, who purchased some of the most extensive private collections in Europe, including those of Heinrich von Brühl, Lord Robert Walpole and Baron Pierre Crozat. By 1774 Catherine’s collection included over 2000 paintings, and by the time of her death in 1796 that number had doubled.
Catherine and her successors didn’t much care for Rastrelli’s baroque interiors and had most of the rooms completely remodelled in classical style. To display her art, Catherine first had built the Small Hermitage and later the so-called Old Hermitage, and allowed prominent people to privately visit the collection on application. In the 1780s Giacomo Quarenghi added the Hermitage Theatre, which served as the private theatre for the imperial family; it is still used today although now for public performances.
The early 19th century saw the expansion of the collection, particularly in the field of classical antiquity, due both to the continued acquisition of other collections and rich finds being discovered in southern Russia. More acquisitions followed Russia’s victory over Napoleon in 1812 and included the private collection of Napoleon’s consort, Joséphine de Beauharnais.
In December 1837 a devastating fire broke out in the heating shaft of the Field Marshals’ Hall; it burned for over 30 hours and destroyed a large portion of the interior. Most of the imperial belongings were saved, thrown out of windows or dragged outside to sit in the snow. Nicholas I vowed to restore the palace as quickly as possible, employing architect Vasily Stasov and thousands of workers to toil around the clock. Their efforts were not in vain, as the project was completed in a little over a year. Most of the classical interiors in the ceremonial rooms that we see today, including the Grand Hall, the Throne Room and the Armorial Hall, were designed by Stasov.

Russia’s First Public Art Museum
While Peter the Great opened the Kunstkamera, his private collection of curiosities, to the public in the early 18th century, it was Nicholas I who eventually opened the first public art museum in Russia. During a visit to Germany in 1838 he was impressed by the museums he saw in Munich – specifically, by the idea of buildings that were architectural masterpieces in themselves, designed specifically to house and preserve artistic masterpieces. He employed German architect Leo von Klenze and local boy Vasily Stasov to carry out such a project in the proximity of the Winter Palace. The result was the ‘neo-Grecian’ New Hermitage, adorned by statues and bas-reliefs depicting great artists, writers and other cultural figures. After 11 years of work, the museum was opened to the public in 1852.
At this time, the first director of the Hermitage was appointed and the collection as a museum, rather than the tsar’s private gallery, began to take shape. Various further acquisitions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries meant that the Hermitage had truly arrived as a world-class museum. Particularly important caches of paintings included the two Leonardo da Vinci Madonnas (acquired in 1865 and 1914), Piotr Semionov-Tien-Shansky’s enormous collection of Dutch and Flemish art, purchased in 1910, and the Stroganov collection of Italian old masters.

Expanding the Collection
It was the postrevolutionary period that saw a threefold increase in the Hermitage’s collection. In 1917 the Winter Palace and the Hermitage were declared state museums, and throughout the 1920s and 1930s the Soviet state seized and nationalised countless valuable private collections, including those of the Stroganovs, Sheremetyevs, Shuvalovs, Yusupovs and Baron Stieglitz. In 1948 it incorporated the renowned collections of post-Impressionist and Impressionist paintings of Moscow industrialists Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov, including works by Matisse and Picasso.
During WWII, Soviet troops in Germany and Eastern Europe appropriated enormous numbers of paintings that had belonged to private collectors. In 1995, after years of keeping the paintings in storage, the Hermitage finally put these works, including those by Monet, Degas, Renoir, Cézanne, Picasso and Matisse, on public display. In recent years, the museum has been building a collection of contemporary art that currently numbers around 1500 pieces, some of which are displayed in the General Staff Building – a tiny fraction of the three million items listed in the Hermitage’s inventory.

St Petersburg’s Bridges
A city threaded with canals and rivers needs bridges. St Petersburg has made a virtue of this necessity, crafting bridges that are both practical and beautiful to look at. Here are a few of our favourites:

Anichkov most | popova valeriya/shutterstock ©
Anichkov most (Аничков мост)
Named after its engineer and featuring rearing horses at all four corners, the striking ornamentation of this bridge symbolises humanity’s struggle with and taming of nature.
Bankovsky most (Банковский мост)
This charming footbridge is suspended by cables emerging from the mouths of golden-winged griffins. The name comes from the Assignment Bank (now a further-education institute), which stands on one side of the bridge.

Griffin statue, Bankovsky most | win-initiative/Getty Images ©
Lviny most (Львиный мост)
Another suspension footbridge over Griboyedov Canal, this one is supported by pairs of regal lions, hence its name.
Panteleymonovsky most (Пантелеймоновский мост)
At the confluence of the Moyka and the Fontanka, this beauty features lamp posts bedecked with the double-headed eagle and railings adorned with the coat of arms.
1-y Inzhenerny most (Первый Инженерный мост)
While there is no shortage of adornment on the cast-iron bridge leading to Mikhailovsky Castle, the highlight is the Chizhik-Pyzhik, the statue of the little bird that hovers over the Moyka.
Troitsky most (Троицкий мост)
Opened in 1903, this Franco-Russian codesign is a Style Moderne classic. Like most other spans across the Neva it is a drawbridge, raised every evening during the shipping season at designated times to allow the passage of river traffic.

Explore Sennaya & Kolomna
Stretching north and south of the meandering Moyka River, these two neighbourhoods may lack the dense concentration of sights found in the Historic Heart, but are still blessed with some spectacular sights. By day, you can explore the lavish interiors of the Yusupov Palace or bask in the greenery and art-filled spaces of New Holland Island, then return by night for magnificent concerts at one of three performing arts venues under the Mariinsky umbrella.
There’s also much history hidden in these scenic streets. Russophiles can wander the lanes off Sennaya Ploschad, a region where Dostoevesky – and some of his best known characters – lived and roamed, and explore pivotal domestic achievements at the Central Naval Museum and the Railway Museum. There are plenty of lesser known attractions as well, including one of the city’s most photogenic cathedrals and Russia’s most impressive synagogue.
You could spend a few days exploring the area, or simply base yourself here. The district offers proximity to the Historic Heart – with more of a local feel – and plenty of great dining options as well.
Local Life
ACanal Life Sennaya and Kolomna are home to some of the prettiest canals in the city, well away from the crowds. Check out the gorgeous Kryukov Canal, the far ends of the Griboyedov Canal and the Fontanka River.
AFree Concerts Check out the Maly Zal (small hall) at the Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory, where you’ll often see fantastic free concerts from students and alumni.
ATransport Issues Get to know the bus and marshrutka routes if you’re going to be spending any time in Kolomna, where there’s no metro and distances on foot can be very long.
ADay at the Park Take a break from sightseeing and join locals for a leisurely hour or two in New Holland. Play chess, ping pong, pétanque or join a yoga or fitness class.
Getting There & Away
AMetro Sennaya is served by the interconnecting Sennaya pl (Line 2), Spasskaya (Line 4) and Sadovaya (Line 5) stations, the city’s biggest interchange, entrances to which are all on Sennaya pl. Kolomna is not served by the metro at all at the time of writing, though an extension to the Mariinsky is planned. Currently the nearest stations are those on Sennaya pl or Admiralteyskaya station in the Historic Heart.
ABus Bus 3 connects the Mariinsky with Nevsky pr via Bolshaya Morskaya ul, while Trolleybus 5 connects pl Truda with Nevsky pr via Konnogvardeysky bul.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
Book ahead of time to see the ballet or opera performance you’re interested in at the Mariinsky Theatre, especially during the White Nights, when performances of popular productions sell out months in advance. You can book and pay for tickets on the website, and then collect them at the box office before the performance, which is much better than trying to find what’s available once you’re in town.

MARIINSKY THEATRE
The Mariinsky Theatre has played a pivotal role in Russian ballet ever since it was built in 1859, and it remains one of Russia's most loved and respected cultural institutions. Its pretty green-and-white main building on aptly named Teatralnaya pl (Theatre Sq) is a must for any visitor wanting to see one of the world's great ballet and opera stages.


brian kinney / shutterstock ©
A Glittering History
The building you see today opened its doors in 1860, and was named in honour of Maria Alexandrovna, the wife of Tsar Alexander II. Since its inception, the Mariinsky has seen some of the world's greatest musicians, dancers and singers on its stage. Petipa choreographed his most famous works here, including Swan Lake and The Nutcracker, and the premieres of Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades and Prokofiev's Romeo & Juliet were also held here. The Soviets initially closed the Mariinsky down, but as the renamed Kirov Ballet it became a major force in promoting the Soviet Union abroad, and is still the main reason that ballet and Russia remain synonymous worldwide.
Performance
The best way to experience the building as its designers intended is to see an opera or ballet. Outside performance times you can wander into the theatre’s foyer and maybe peep into the lovely auditorium. As well as the main Mariinsky Theatre, there is also the newer, world-class Mariinsky II next door, a 2000-seat, six-stage theatre that marks the Mariinsky’s arrival in the 21st century.

YUSUPOV PALACE
This spectacular palace on the Moyka River has some of the best 19th-century interiors in the city, in addition to a fascinating and gruesome history. The palace’s last owner was the eccentric Prince Felix Yusupov, a high-society darling and at one time the richest man in Russia. Most notoriously, this palace is where Grigory Rasputin was murdered in 1916.


peter kovalev / contributor / GETTY IMAGES ©
Amazing Interiors
The palace was built by Vallin de la Mothe in the 1770s, but the current interiors date from a century later, when it became the residence of the illustrious Yusupov family. The palace interiors are sumptuous and rich, with many halls painted in different styles and decked out with gilded chandeliers, silks, frescoes, tapestries and some fantastic furniture. Your visit begins on the 2nd floor, which features an amazing ballroom (the White Column Room), banquet hall, the delightful Green Drawing Room and the ornate rococo private theatre. The tour continues on the ground floor, where you will see the fabulous Turkish Study (used by Felix as a billiards room), the Prince's study and the Moorish Drawing Room, among many other rooms.
The Mad Monk
In 1916 Rasputin was murdered here by Felix Yusupov and some fellow plotters, who considered the Siberian mystic to have become too powerful. To see the room where Rasputin’s murder began (he was poisoned and shot to no avail, finally succumbing to drowning) you have to pay for an extra 90-minute tour, which takes place at 5pm daily.

NEW HOLLAND ISLAND
Closed to the public for much of the past three centuries, New Holland Island has been transformed into a stunning new green space and cultural complex. Come to check out art installations on the grounds, have a meal or a drink in one of the historic brick buildings, and take part in some of the many events happening year-round.


brian kinney / shutterstock ©
Background
In Peter’s time, the complex was used for shipbuilding (its name refers to the place where he learned the trade). The impressive red-brick-and-granite arch, designed by Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe in the late 18th century, is one of the city’s best examples of Russian classicism. In the 19th century, a large basin was built in the middle of the island and experiments were conducted by scientist Alexey Krylov in an attempt to build a boat that couldn’t be capsized. In 1915 the navy built a radio transmitter here – the most powerful in Russia at the time. It was from there that Lenin gave his famous 1917 broadcast, announcing the revolution had begun. During WWII, the island suffered heavy damage during bomb raids and artillery fire. The buildings that did survive fell into ruin in the post-war years, and remained largely derelict until the 21st century.
Buildings & Grounds
Near the entrance to the island, the newly built Pavilion houses temporary exhibitions and is also the place to hear lectures, artist presentations and other events. Around the corner, the handsomely restored Foundry, dating from the mid-19th century, is built on the site that some believe was used as Peter the Great’s original blacksmith shop. Today it houses the casual Volkonsky Deli and the more stylish Kuznya House, a sit-down restaurant that transitions into a late-night lounge with DJs on weekends. In front of the Foundry, a herb garden adds beauty to the setting, with its lavender, dill, thyme, mint and other plants. A small pond at the centre of New Holland invites contemplation (and ice skating in winter). A path skirts the perimeter, while stairs lead down to pontoons, getting you close to the water.
Work continues on New Holland, with 2017 seeing the opening of the Bottle, a brick, three-storey, ring-shaped building dating from the 19th century that has cafes, stores (including an excellent art-minded bookseller) and workshops. An inner courtyard has a small stage with its own line-up of concerts and other events.
Events
There are loads of events happening in New Holland. Outdoor concerts are the big draw in the summer, and past years have brought out top names from SPB’s music scene as well as international artists like Ane Brun from Stockholm and hip-hop trio Digable Planets from Brooklyn. It’s a peaceful place to perfect your sun salutations during yoga sessions on the grass, hone your drawing skills at a sketching class, or work up a sweat during ‘Sports Days’ when trainers give free fitness classes. You can also catch periodic film screenings and lectures on art and architecture.
Hands-on Activities
Aside from lounging on the grass on warm sunny days, the island is a fine spot for a bit of ping pong, pétanque or chess. New Holland even hosts occasional tournaments – all are welcome to join. You can hire out games from the visitor centre. In the winter, there’s also ice skating on the pond.
Playground
A photogenic playground pays homage to New Holland’s shipbuilding days with a model of the Petr and Pavel frigate, built to 80% scale. Stretching 26m long and 6m high, this open wooden structure has rope bridges, platforms, a wooden steering wheel, and a telescope, making it a fantastic setting for kids to explore. Next to it is a smaller playground better suited to younger kids, with swings and slides.

SENNAYA PLOSHCHADSQUARE
(Сенная площадь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Immortalised by Dostoevsky, who lived all over the neighbourhood and set Crime and Punishment here, St Petersburg’s Haymarket was once the city’s filthy underbelly. Indeed, until a much-needed facelift just over a decade ago, the square was overloaded with makeshift kiosks and market stalls, which made it a magnet for the homeless, beggars, pickpockets and drunks. These days, you'll have to look hard to find vestiges of its once insalubrious days.
The peripatetic Dostoevsky, who occupied some 20 residences in his 28-year stay in the city, once spent a couple of days in debtors’ prison in what is now called the Senior Officers’ Barracks, just across the square from the Sennaya pl metro station.
Alyona Ivanovna, the elderly moneylender murdered in Crime and Punishment, lived a few blocks west of here, at nab kanala Griboyedova 104. Her flat would have been No 74, in the courtyard on the 3rd floor.
RAILWAY MUSEUMMUSEUM

This museum near Sennaya pl is a must for train-set fans and modellers. It houses a collection of scale locomotives and model railway bridges, often made by the engineers who built the real ones. The oldest such collection in the world, the museum dates to 1809, 28 years before Russia had its first working train!
Come on weekends for the free Russian-language tours of the museum (held at 11am and 2pm), when guides raise little drawbridges, ring station bells and operate mechanised trains along various tracks in the galleries.
Look out for the fantastic map of Russia hanging above the main museum staircase showing all the train lines in the country, which almost makes up for the total lack of signage in English.
YUSUPOV GARDENSPARK
(Юсуповский сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Sadovaya ul; hsunrise-sunset; mSadovaya)
West of Sennaya pl along Sadovaya ul you’ll find the charming Yusupov Gardens, a pleasant park with a big lake in the middle. The flower-filled grounds are a popular place to stroll, sit and sunbathe. The building set back behind the gardens is the Old Yusupov Palace ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) (not to be confused with the Yusupov Palace on the Moyka River), which is closed to the public and is used mainly for official receptions.
BERTHOLD CENTREARTS CENTRE
(Бертгольд Центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.vk.com/bertholdcentre; Grazhdanskaya ul 13; mSadovaya)
One of St Petersburg's newest 'art clusters', the Berthold Centre has a handful of shops, cafes and galleries spread around a former foundry. There's a courtyard in the centre of the complex that gathers a young, bohemian crowd – especially during special events and concerts (bands sometimes play on a rooftop just overlooking the courtyard).

CENTRAL NAVAL MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Центральный военно-морской музей MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-303 8513; www.navalmuseum.ru; pl Truda; adult/student R600/400; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Following a move to this beautifully repurposed building opposite the former shipyard of New Holland, the Central Naval Museum has moved into the 21st century and is now one of St Petersburg's best history museums. The superb, light-bathed building houses an enormous collection of models, paintings and other artefacts from three centuries of Russian naval history, including botik, the small boat known as the 'grandfather of the Russian navy' – stumbling across it in the late 17th century was Peter the Great's inspiration to create a Russian maritime force.
The real attraction here is the superb collection of model boats, some of which are simply extraordinary in size and detail. There's sadly little signage in English, so it's worthwhile paying extra for an audio guide (R600 to R800) if you're interested in really understanding what you're seeing. The entrance to the museum is opposite New Holland on nab Kryukova kanala.
NIKOLSKY CATHEDRALCATHEDRAL
(Никольский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nikolskaya pl 1/3; h9am-7pm; mSadovaya)
Surrounded on two sides by canals, this ice-blue cathedral is one of the most picture-perfect in the city, beloved by locals for its baroque spires and golden domes. It was one of the few churches that still operated during the Soviet era, when organised religion was effectively banned.
Nicknamed the Sailor’s Church (Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors), it contains many 18th-century icons set against rich green columns, and a fine carved wooden iconostasis, though visitors are limited to only a small area of the church’s interior.
A graceful bell tower overlooks the Griboyedov Canal, which is crossed by Staro-Nikolsky most. From this bridge, you can see seven other bridges, more than from any other spot in the city.
MISPGALLERY

This multi-floored gallery near the Griboyedov Canal stages intriguing exhibitions that showcase the talents of Russian artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. The content changes roughly every two months, and past shows have delved into Russian symbolism, Soviet depictions of femininity, Russian futurism, and portraits and landscapes from the Leningrad school.
NABOKOV MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей Набокова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.nabokov.museums.spbu.ru/En; Bolshaya Morskaya ul 47; h11am-6pm Tue-Fri, to 5pm Sat; mAdmiralteyskaya)F
This 19th-century townhouse was the suitably grand childhood home of Vladimir Nabokov, infamous author of Lolita and arguably the most versatile of 20th century Russian writers. Here Nabokov lived with his wealthy family from his birth in 1899 until the revolution in 1917, when they left the country. Nabokov artefacts on display include family photographs, first editions of his books and parts of his extensive butterfly collection.
The house features heavily in Nabokov’s autobiography Speak, Memory, in which he refers to it as a ‘paradise lost’. Indeed, he never returned, dying abroad in 1977. Aside from the various Nabokov artefacts, there's actually relatively little to see of the former home itself, save for some charming interiors (ask to see the gorgeous stained-glass windows in the stairwell, which are not technically part of the museum, but staff may allow you to take a peek).
RUMYANTSEV MANSIONMUSEUM
(Особняк Румянцева MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Angliyskaya nab 44; adult/student R200/100; h11am-6pm Thu-Mon, to 5pm Tue; mAdmiralteyskaya)
History buffs should not miss this oft-overlooked but superb local museum. Part of the State Museum of the History of St Petersburg, the mansion contains an exhibition of 20th-century history, including displays devoted to the 1921 New Economic Policy (NEP), the industrialisation and development of the 1930s, and the Siege of Leningrad during WWII. Exhibitions are unusual in that they depict everyday life in the city during these historic periods. Each room has an explanatory panel in English.
The museum is housed in the majestic 1826 mansion of Count Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantsev, a famous diplomat, politician and statesman, as well as an amateur historian whose personal research library became the basis for the Russian State Library in Moscow. The history of the mansion and its owners is fascinating in itself, and the few restored staterooms at the front of the house suggest daily life for the Rumyantsevs was an opulent affair.
GRAND CHORAL SYNAGOGUESYNAGOGUE
(Большая хоральная синагога MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %921-978 4464; www.eng.jewishpetersburg.ru; Lermontovsky pr 2; h10am-6pm Sun-Fri, services 10am Sat; mSadovaya)
Designed by Vasily Stasov, the striking Grand Choral Synagogue opened in 1893 to provide a central place of worship for St Petersburg’s growing Jewish community. Its lavishness (particularly notable in the 47m-high cupola and the decorative wedding chapel) indicates the pivotal role that Jews played in imperial St Petersburg. The synagogue was fully revamped in 2003. Visitors are welcome except on the Sabbath and other holy days. Men and married women should cover their heads upon entering.
Also on-site are the Small Synagogue (generally opened for guided tours only), the Jewish restaurant Le'chaim and a Kosher Shop. In summer, the synagogue also hosts performances with a Jewish cantor and other musicians performing chaaznut and klezmer music. The synagogue organises English-language tours of the building, as well as Jewish heritage tours of St Petersburg, all of which need to be organised in advance – see the website.
RUSSIAN VODKA MUSEUMMUSEUM

This excellent private museum tells the story of Russia’s national tipple in an interesting and fun way, from the first production of ‘bread wine’ to the phenomenon of the modern international vodka industry, complete with waxwork models and some very cool bottles. You can guide yourself through the exhibit, or be accompanied by an English-speaking guide who’ll liven things up a bit. If you’d like to sample the exhibits, too, take a tasting tour!
There’s an excellent restaurant in the same building, and if you eat there, you can get a discount on museum entry.

Formerly the Horse Guards’ Riding School, this large white neoclassical building was constructed between 1804 and 1807 from a design by Giacomo Quarenghi. It now houses rotating art and commercial exhibitions, often featuring contemporary and local artists. Check the website to see what's on while you're in town. There's a good cafe and a bookshop on the basement level.

Back in the day, this was called the Museum of Atheism; it had a very strong anti-religious bent and was housed in the Kazan Cathedral. Now the name has changed, as has the location, but the fascinating exhibition remains, describing the history of various world religions, including Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity, and taking in everything from Russian icons to Pacific cults and Greek gods. Very little is signed in English, but there is a good-value audio guide.
HOUSE OF MUSICPALACE
(Дом музыки MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-400 1400; www.spdm.ru; nab reki Moyki 211; tours R350; hticket office 11am-6pm Mon-Thu, to 5pm Fri; mSadovaya)
This fabulous and fully restored mansion on the Moyka River belonged to Grand Duke Alexey, the son of Alexander II. The wrought-iron-and-stone fence is one of its most stunning features, with the Grand Duke’s monogram adorning the gates. Tours of the house usually take place once or twice a week, but the dates vary and tickets often sell out in advance, so check the website. Another way to visit the interior is to attend a concert here.
The palace was built in 1895 by Maximilian Messmacher, and each facade represents a different architectural style. The interior is equally diverse, and since renovation has housed the House of Music (Dom Muzyki), where popular classical concerts (R200 to R1000) are regularly held in the building's English Hall. Guided tours are given in Russian and German only.
ST ISIDORE'S CHURCHCHURCH
(Свято-Исидоровская церковь MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Rimskogo Korsakova 24; h9am-6.30pm; mSadovaya)
The last great church to have been built in St Petersburg before the revolution, this neo-Byzantine beauty dates from 1907 and creates one of the most gorgeous silhouettes in the entire city, best viewed from the nearby Pikalov Bridge, or the Griboyedov Canal. There's little to see inside, but it's worth a detour to see its onion domes.
MARIINSKY PALACEPALACE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Moyki)
The last neoclassical palace constructed in St Petersburg, the Mariinsky Palace (not to be confused with the theatre) was built between 1839 and 1844. Today it houses the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg, and is closed to the public.
ALEXANDER BLOK HOUSE-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей-квартира Блока MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; ul Dekabristov 57; adult/student R150/100; h11am-6pm Thu-Mon, to 5pm Tue; mSadovaya)
This museum occupies the flat where poet Alexander Blok spent the last eight years of his life (1912–20). The 4th-floor apartment has been preserved much as it was when Blok lived here with his wife Lyubov (daughter of chemist and inventor Mendeleev). When the poet fell ill in 1920, his family moved into the 2nd-floor apartment where he died a year later. An exhibition demonstrates the influence of Blok’s work, as well as some original copies of his poems; signage in Russian only.
The revolutionary Blok believed that individualism had caused a decline in society’s ethics, a situation that would only be rectified by the communist revolution he lived to see, though he died before he could become truly disillusioned with post-revolutionary Russia. The room where Blok died contains his death mask and a drawing of Blok on his deathbed, sketched on the last page of the poet’s pad. Chamber concerts and poetry readings occasionally take place here; ask downstairs for the schedule.
POPOV COMMUNICATIONS MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей связи Попова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.rustelecom-museum.ru; Pochtamtsky per 4; adult/student R200/100; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sat; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Housed in the fabulous 18th-century palace of Chancellor Bezborodko, this museum of communications is the perfect addition to Pochtamtskaya ul (Post Office St). It is named for Professor Alexander Popov, inventor of the radio, and it covers all manner of communication, from the Pony Express to the modern era.
Exhibits are interactive and interesting, including an antique telephone switchboard that still works, the first civil communications satellite, Luch-15, which occupies a prominent place in the atrium, and plenty of multimedia explanations of how things work. Stamp collectors will have a field day admiring the national philatelic collection.
DOSTOEVSKY'S DOMAIN

Dostoevsky lived all over this area; he resided in three flats on tiny Kaznacheyskaya ul alone. From 1861 to 1863, he lived at No 1. In 1864, he spent one month living in the faded red building at No 9, before moving to No 7. Here, he lived from 1864 to 1867 and wrote Crime and Punishment; indeed, the route taken by the novel’s antihero Raskolnikov to murder the old moneylender passed directly under his window.
Speaking of Crime and Punishment, one of the most infamous addresses in the neighbourhood is an innocuous house on the corner of Stolyarny per (called ‘S… lane’ in the book). Known as the Raskolnikov House, it's one of two possible locations of the attic apartment of Dostoevsky's troubled protagonist. Those who claim this is the place go further, saying that Rodion retrieved the murder weapon from a street-sweeper’s storage bin inside the tunnel leading to the courtyard.
The house, not open to the public, is marked by a sculpture of Dostoevsky. The inscription says something to the effect of ‘The tragic fate of the people of this area of St Petersburg formed the foundation of Dostoevsky’s passionate sermon of goodness for all mankind’. Other Dostoevsky connoisseurs argue that it would be more appropriate if Raskolnikov’s attic apartment was located further down the street at No 9, which is otherwise unmarked.

CO-OP GARAGEPIZZA$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cooperativegarage.com; Gorokhovaya 47; pizzas R260-390; hnoon-midnight Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri & Sat; Wv)
Tucked into an unmarked courtyard off Gorokhovaya, this sprawling restaurant and drinking den is the go-to spot for creatively topped thin-crust pizzas and craft beers. The industrial setting draws a chatty crowd of tatted-up hipsters and style mavens, with a mostly rock soundtrack playing in the background. On warm days you can take a table in the courtyard.
There's also a small take-out window opposite the pizza spot, where you can get tasty wok-fried noodles and draught beer.
JULIA CHILD BISTROINTERNATIONAL$

This neighbourhood charmer is a fine anytime spot, with good coffees, teas and snacks, plus creative thoughtfully prepared dishes like kasha (porridge) with mushrooms and feta for breakfast, or halibut with lemon cabbage and celery mousse later in the day. Kindly staff and a laid-back setting will make you want to stick around for a while.
Despite the name, there isn't much of a Julia Child connection – aside perhaps from the emphasis on quality ingredients and an interior that vaguely resembles the cookbook virtuoso's studio kitchen.
TESTOITALIAN$
(Тесто MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.testogastronomica.ru; per Grivtsova 5/29; mains R310-550; h11am-11pm; Wv; mSennaya Ploshchad)
This pleasant little place is good value and yet takes Italian cookery very seriously. Choose from a wide range of homemade pastas and top them with your favourite sauce, whether tomato-based bolognese or a rich, creamy salmon sauce. A few options for soup, salad and pizza round out the menu, but the pasta is the main focus.

This sparkling, friendly and capacious offering right on the Haymarket is a major draw for diners at all hours. Like many other Ginza restaurants, Khochu Kharchu has a fully photographic menu of delicious comfort food, focused on Mingrelian (West Georgian) cooking. Come for calorific khachapuri (cheese-stuffed bread), khinkali (dumplings), and of course the eponymous kharcho, a beef, rice, tomato and walnut soup.
OH! MUMBAIINDIAN$$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 0340; per Grivtsova 2; mains R380-880; hnoon-11pm; Wv; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Headed by a chef from New Delhi, this attractive eatery, decorated with colourful metal lamps and strung with prayer flags, serves up some of the best Indian cooking in the city. You'll find filling and satisfying curries, tandoors and a delicious selection of vegetarian options – all go nicely with piping hot naan (flatbread).
Service can be slow, so order some papadums or samosas, and sip that mango lassi slowly while you wait.

An old-fashioned elegance prevails at Severyanin, one of the top choices for Russian cuisine near Sennaya pl. Amid vintage wallpaper, mirrored armoires and tasselled lampshades, you might feel like you've stepped back a few decades. Start off with the excellent mushroom soup or borsch (beetroot soup), before moving on to rabbit ragout in puff pastry or Baltic flounder with wine sauce.
Excellent but friendly service and fair prices.
KARAVANCENTRAL ASIAN$$
(Караван MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Voznesensky pr 46; mains R420-790; h10am-1am; v; mSadovaya)
Despite the somewhat kitschy decor, Karavan is a superb Central Asian restaurant with a lovely location overlooking the Fontanka River. Open grills line the dining room, giving an optimum view (and scent) of the kebabs that are on the menu. Meat aside, there's also satisfying vareniki (dumplings), mushroom soup and rich Adjarian khachapuri (cheese bread topped with egg).
You'll also find good Georgian wines on hand and Weihenstephaner on tap.

Combining a love of bicycles and street food from around the globe, Kafe and Bikes serves up delicious cooking amid upbeat grooves, exposed bulbs and those slate grey walls so prevalent in St Petersburg. Shawarmas (grilled meat and salad wrapped in flat bread), wok-fried buckwheat noodles with vegetables, pizzas, khachapuri (Georgian cheese bread) and syrniki (sweet cheese fritters) are all served up in a hurry by friendly staff.
Don't miss the pedal-powered blender in the corner – a fine way to get in a workout while making your own smoothie. You can also hire a bicycle here (per hour from R150).
VOLKONSKY DELIINTERNATIONAL$

DEDUSHKA KHOSOUP$
(Дедушка Хо MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Lermontovsky pr 10; mains R170-290; h11am-11pm; mSadovaya)
When the weather sours, retreat to this snug, casual spot just west of Nikolsky Cathedral for warming bowls of pho (Vietnamese noodle soup) topped with veal, and shrimp-filled tom yum (spicy soup with lemongrass).
The soups are filling and served up in a hurry, but if you're famished throw in an order of summer rolls (filled with shrimp, chicken and vegetables).

This much-feted, eclectic and original restaurant has got it all just right. The venue itself is a lot of fun to nose around, with multiple small rooms, nooks and crannies. Service is friendly and fast (when it’s not too busy) and the peppy, inventive Italian-leaning menu has something for everyone. Reservations are usually required, so call ahead.
The restaurant is full of unexpected props, from table football to a child’s playroom. Dishes come from all over the world and there are plenty of vegetarian choices, as well as breakfasts served until noon (1pm on weekends).
KUZNYA HOUSEINTERNATIONAL$$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/kuznyahouse; nab Admiralteyskogo kanala; mains R450-890; hnoon-11pm Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat; Wv)
Set in the atmospheric Foundry building, Kuznya House has a creative menu that hopscotches around the globe, with tasty dishes like salmon ceviche with fennel, tandoori chicken, and mussels with frites. It's a stylish but easygoing spot for a meal or a drink, and it transforms into a lounge spot on weekends when DJs spin until the early hours.
Breakfast is served from noon to 2pm (till 4pm on weekends).

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-903 2373; www.sadko-rst.ru; ul Glinki 2; mains R540-1200; hnoon-1am; c; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Serving all the Russian favourites, this impressive restaurant’s decor combines traditional Zhostovo floral designs and Murano glass chandeliers amid vaulted ceilings and elegantly set tables. It’s popular with theatregoers (reserve ahead in the high season), as it’s an obvious pre- or post-Mariinsky dining option.
The waiters, all music students at the nearby Conservatory, give 'impromptu' vocal performances (usually Thursday to Sunday nights around 7pm).
There’s a great children’s room and a full children’s menu to boot, so families are very well catered for.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.graf-in.com; Konnogvardeysky bul 4; mains R480-990; h11am-midnight Sun-Thu, to 2am Fri & Sat; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)
This smart, funky but informal restaurant offers an international selection of food focused mainly on Modern European cooking, with sections of the menu devoted to Josper, pasta and Asian food, among others. The dishes are prepared in the glass-walled kitchen and are all beautifully presented, while the art direction budget attracts a young and chic crowd.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-992 4220; Nikolskaya pl 5; sandwiches R320-480, mains R490-960; h11am-midnight; W; mSadovaya)
Charming Entrée comes in two parts: the cafe-cum-deli to the right has a chessboard floor, rustic decor, delicious éclairs and sandwiches and, for some reason, Michael Douglas’ signature scrawled on the wall. Behind the curtain is a more formal restaurant with a European menu (duck confit, risotto with wild mushrooms) and a sizeable wine list.
Service could be a little friendlier, but otherwise this place is a great find in a rather desolate stretch of the city centre. Breakfast is served all day.

This stylish Italian-run restaurant on one side of the charming Kryukov Canal offers a full menu of traditional Italian cooking, from its large meat selection to main courses such as grilled salmon with red caviar, cherry tomatoes and fennel. Ask for the pizza menu (R360 to R740), as it's separate to the main one. Breakfast is served daily until noon.

Something of an expat favourite, the Idiot is a charming place that has been serving up high-quality Russian fare for years now. The friendly basement location is all about atmosphere, relaxation and fun (encouraged by the complimentary vodka coming with each meal). You can't go wrong here, whether opting for bliny (wheat pancakes) with caviar, grilled trout or pelmeni (Russian-style ravioli) with mushrooms and sour cream.
The cosy subterranean space, the antique furnishings and crowded bookshelves make it an extremely pleasant place to come for a bite or for drinks.

Beef lovers can indulge their habit at this 12,000-sq-metre restaurant, the city’s biggest. Thanks to clever design, though, it doesn’t feel overwhelmingly large or impersonal, with the huge space divided into six stylish yet informal dining spaces. The steaks menu is impressive and there's a large list of side orders, salads and other main courses to choose from as well.
There’s a fun children’s playroom here, making it a good choice for young families.

(Лехаим MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-572 5616; www.spb-lehaim.ru; Lemontovsky pr 2; mains R390-620; h10am-10pm Sun-Thu)
St Petersburg's only kosher restaurant, Le'chaim whips up carefully prepared Jewish and European dishes.

A decent-value, modern and stylish cafe just moments from St Isaac's Cathedral, Dekabrist sounds like it might be too good to be true. The menu is simple but eclectic, and includes burgers, grilled salmon, pork schnitzel, falafel and a range of salads and desserts, while the two-floor space is comfortable and sociable, even if the lighting is borderline interrogatory.
MIGAKOREAN$$

The authentic (read: no frills) Korean restaurant is a great find in this quiet residential neighbourhood. There's a wide-ranging, pictorial menu that includes delicious bulgogi (Korean beef barbecue), bossam (spicy pork belly) and bajon (seafood pancakes), as well as perennial favourite bibimbap. Service is fast and friendly, and there's a private banquet room, which draws in the foreign groups.

Repa may be Russian for turnip but this delightful restaurant, cheek-by-jowl with the Mariinsky, is anything but rustic. Beautifully painted murals of dancers grace the walls as waiters glide by delivering glasses of sparkling wine and plates of bliny, Kamchatka crab or whole baked fish to elegantly attired customers.

This charming, welcoming place is the restaurant of the Russian Vodka Museum, but it’s good enough to be a destination in its own right. The interior enjoys a grand old-world dacha feel, as does the menu: rack of lamb in pomegranate sauce, whole fried Gatchina trout and Kamchatka crab with porcini mushrooms take you back to imperial tastes and tsarist opulence.
As you’d expect there’s a huge vodka list (shots R100 to R500) and the knowledgeable staff will help you match your meal to one of the many bottles they sell.

It's all about glass at the rooftop restaurant of the Gazprom building. This impressive place definitely has the best views in town and you can almost touch the dome of St Isaac’s Cathedral from the nicest tables (book in advance). Yet despite the fixation, the food is no afterthought, with a delicious range of international fare and a superb wine list on offer.

SOLARIS LABCAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/solarislab11; per Pirogova 18, 4th fl; h1pm-midnight; mSadovaya)
Set inside a glass, semi-spherical dome, Solaris Lab has magnificent views over the russet rooftops of St Petersburg to the glittering dome of St Isaac's. It draws a mixed crowd of families and hipsters, who linger over pots of high-quality tea and tasty desserts (try the lemon tart). On warm days, there's outdoor seating on the rooftop.
Head up to the top floor to find this remarkable cafe.
SCHUMLICAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.schumli.ru; Kazanskaya ul 40; h9.30am-10pm Mon-Fri, from noon Sat & Sun; W; mSennaya Ploshchad)
With its large range of coffees, sumptuous selection of cakes and – best of all – freshly made Belgian waffles, this small but friendly cafe is a great place to regain flagging energy when wandering around the city. There's an upstairs dining room for full meals (mains R320 to R640), but coffee with a side of something sweet is the real reason to come.
CROCODILEBAR
(Крокодил MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Galernaya ul 18; h12.30pm-midnight; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)
This pleasant place is a fine low-key setting for a drink. Enjoy a dimly lit but artsy interior (including a piano just waiting to be played) and an interesting, eclectic menu (mains R480-920) when hunger strikes.
STIRKA 40BAR
(Стирка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Kazanskaya ul 26; h11am-midnight Sun-Thu, to 4am Fri & Sat; W; mSennaya Ploshchad)
This friendly joint, whose name means 'washing', has three washing machines, so you can drop off a load and have a few beers while you wait. A novel idea, though one few people seem to take advantage of. Its small and unassuming layout makes it a great place for a quiet drink with a cool young crowd.
3ENTERTAINMENT

oMARIINSKY THEATREBALLET, OPERA
(Мариинский театр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-326 4141; www.mariinsky.ru; Teatralnaya pl 1; tickets R1200-6500; mSadovaya)
St Petersburg's most spectacular venue for ballet and opera, the Mariinsky Theatre is an attraction in its own right. Tickets can be bought online or in person; book in advance during the summer months. The magnificent interior is the epitome of imperial grandeur, and any evening here will be an impressive experience.
Known as the Kirov Ballet during the Soviet era, the Mariinsky has an illustrious history, with troupe members including such ballet greats as Nijinsky, Nureyev, Pavlova and Baryshnikov. In recent years the company has been invigorated by the current artistic and general director, Valery Gergiev, who has worked hard to make the company solvent while overseeing the construction of the impressive and much-needed second theatre, the Mariinsky II, across the Kryukov Canal from the company's green-and-white wedding cake of a building. It is pretty certain that the Mariinsky Theatre will close at some point in 2018 or 2019 for a full (and, again, much needed) renovation, so visit the building's faded grandeur while you can.
MARIINSKY IIBALLET, OPERA
(Мариинский II MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-326 4141; www.mariinsky.ru; ul Dekabristov 34; tickets R350-6000; hticket office 11am-7pm; mSadovaya)
Finally opening its doors in 2013 after more than a decade of construction, legal wrangles, scandal and rumour, the Mariinsky II is a showpiece for St Petersburg's most famous ballet and opera company. It is one of the most technically advanced music venues in the world, with superb sightlines and acoustics from all of its 2000 seats.
There's no denying that the modern-yet-not-modern-enough-to-be-interesting exterior is no great addition to St Petersburg's magnificent wealth of buildings. Inside, though, it's a different story. The interior is a beautifully crafted mixture of backlit onyx, multi-level public areas between which staircases, lifts and escalators weave, limestone walls, marble floors and Swarovski chandeliers. The simple yet superbly designed auditorium boasts plenty of legroom, three stages that can be combined to form one, and an orchestra pit that can hold no fewer than 120 musicians. Serious music fans should come here to see a state-of-the-art opera and ballet venue, while anyone curious to see the results of a decade of building work will also not leave disappointed.
As well as the main auditorium, there are also several smaller venues within the venue (Prokofiev Hall, Stravinsky Foyer, Shchedrin Hall, Mussorgsky Hall), all of which host regular concerts that can be a cheaper alternative to seeing a performance in the main hall.
MARIINSKY CONCERT HALLCLASSICAL MUSIC
(Мариинский концертный зал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mariinsky.ru; ul Dekabristov 37; tickets R700-1800; hticket office 11am-8pm; mSadovaya)
Opened in 2007, this concert hall is a magnificent multifaceted creation. It manages to preserve the historic brick facade of the set and scenery warehouse that previously stood on this spot, while the modern main entrance, facing ul Dekabristov, is all tinted glass and angular lines, hardly hinting at the beautiful old building behind.
Its array of classical orchestral performances is superb, but be aware that it’s a modern venue, and won’t provide your typical ‘night at the Mariinsky’ atmosphere.
RIMSKY-KORSAKOV CONSERVATORYCLASSICAL MUSIC
(Консерватория имени Н. А. Римского-Корсакова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 2519; www.conservatory.ru; Teatralnaya pl 3; tickets R300-2000; mSadovaya)
This illustrious music school was the first public music school in Russia. The Bolshoy Zal (Big Hall) on the 3rd floor is an excellent place to see performances by up-and-coming musicians throughout the academic year, while the Maly Zal (Small Hall) often hosts free concerts from present students and alumni; check when you’re in town for what’s on.
Founded in 1862, the Conservatory counts Pyotr Tchaikovsky among its alumni and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov among its former faculty. Dmitry Shostakovich and Sergei Prokofiev are graduates of this institution, as are countless contemporary artistic figures, such as Mariinsky artistic director Valery Gergiev.
YUSUPOV PALACE THEATRETHEATRE
(Театр Юсуповского дворца MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-314 9883; www.yusupov-palace.ru; nab reki Moyki 94; tickets R700-3200; mSadovaya)
Housed inside the outrageously ornate Yusupov Palace, this elaborate yet intimate venue was the home entertainment centre for one of the city’s foremost aristocratic families. While you can visit the theatre when you tour the palace, seeing a performance here is a treat, as you can imagine yourself the personal guest of the notorious Prince Felix himself.
The shows are a mixed bag – usually a ‘Gala Evening’ that features fragments of various Russian classics.
ST PETERSBURG OPERAOPERA
(Санкт-Петербургская Опера MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-312 3982; www.spbopera.ru; ul Galernaya 33; tickets R700-2000; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Housed in the sumptuous (and dare we say, rather bizarre) former home of Baron von Derviz, the St Petersburg Opera performs regular operas in its intimate and grandly lavish former ballroom. With just 187 seats, you're guaranteed a good view of the Russian, Italian and German classics, even if the quality can't compare to other more established opera houses in the city.
FEEL YOURSELF RUSSIAN FOLKSHOWDANCE

Terrible title, but not a bad show of traditional Russian folk dancing and music. The pricey two-hour performance features four different folk groups, complete with accordion, balalaika and Cossack dancers. As a bonus, it's held inside the spectacular Nikolayevsky Palace.
LENDOKCINEMA
(Лендок MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-714 0806; www.lendoc.ru; nab Kryukova kanala 12; tickets R150-350; h11am-11pm; mSenaya)
Occupying a grand former mansion, this cinema and working film studio specialises mainly in documentary films, including international ones, although they do also screen feature films.
The lobby bar is also a pleasant spot for a drink or something to eat – when they have a week specialising in a nation's cinema here, the menu features dishes from that country.

Near the courtyard of the Berthold Centre, this delightful shop has lots of eye-catching objects, much of it made in-house or produced by St Petersburg artisans. You'll find jewellery imprinted with famous paintings, whimsical wooden clocks, ceramics, tiny Konstructor kits (a kind of miniature Lego), artfully painted flasks, backpacks, sunglasses and handmade soaps, lotions and candles.

MATRYOSHKAFASHION & ACCESSORIES
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.matryoshkadesign.com; ul Dekabristov 28; h11am-8pm; mSadovaya)
Designer Natalia Larchenko has taken the classic Russian nesting doll silhouette and transformed it into a tiny work of art in her attractive necklaces, bracelets, earrings – including works in amber from the Kaliningrad region. The curvy design also features in both bold and subtle patterns on silk scarves and shawls, as well as soft pullovers.
Quality materials (rose gold, sterling silver) and fine craftsmanship (most products are made in Italy) are essential to the brand.
NORTHWAYGIFTS & SOUVENIRS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Angliyskaya nab 36/2; h9am-8pm; mAdmiralteyskaya)
There is quite simply no bigger collection of matryoshki (nesting dolls), amber, fur and other Russian souvenir staples than that on offer at this very impressive and stylish shop right on the Neva embankment. Look no further for Russian gifts to take home.
MARIINSKY ART SHOPGIFTS & SOUVENIRS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mariinsky.ru; Mariinsky Theatre, Teatralnaya pl 1; h11am-6pm on performance days, also open during interval; mSadovaya)
Opera and ballet lovers will delight at the theatre-themed souvenirs for sale in the Mariinsky gift shop. None of it is cheap, but the selection is impressive. Also on sale: a comprehensive collection of CDs, DVDs, books and posters that you won’t find elsewhere.
GALLERY OF DOLLSGIFTS & SOUVENIRS
(Галерея кукол MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshaya Morskaya ul 53/8; entry R50; hnoon-7pm Tue-Sat; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Featuring ballerinas and babushkas, clowns and knights, this gallery depicts just about every fairy-tale character and political persona in doll form. The highly creative figures are more like art than toys and make unusual souvenirs (although they’re admittedly an acquired taste).
KOSHER SHOPFOOD & DRINKS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.en.jeps.ru; Lermontovsky pr 2; h10am-9pm Sun-Fri; mSadovaya)
Serving St Petersburg’s Jewish community, the Kosher Shop is conveniently located next to the Grand Choral Synagogue. Although its emphasis is on hard-to-find kosher food, the shop also sells some souvenirs (Jewish-themed matryoshki), Jewish music and art.
SENNOY MARKETFOOD & DRINKS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Moskovsky pr 4; h8am-7pm; mSennaya Ploshchad)
Cheaper and less atmospheric than Kuznechny Market, Sennoy Market is also centrally located. You’ll find fruit and vegies, as well as freshly caught fish and fresh meat, which makes it a useful spot for self-caterers.
MIR ESPRESSOFOOD & DRINKS
(Мир Эспрессо MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Dekabristov 12/10; h9am-8pm Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; mSadovaya)

Explore Smolny & Vosstaniya
This area, bisected by the second half of Nevsky pr, breaks down into four districts: Smolny, Liteyny, Vosstaniya and Vladimirskaya. An extremely varied place, it contains the closest thing St Petersburg has to a creative hub, as well as its political and diplomatic heart. You could easily spend a few days taking in the major sights of this vast district and still only scratch the surface.
Among the big draws here are the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, worth a half-day visit in the southeast corner, and the collection of museums and historic sites in Liteyny near the Fontanka River, which could warrant a full day (or more) of exploration. Aside from delving into history and culture, there's much to discover just on neighbourhood wanders – from browsing record stores and indie booksellers on streets a few blocks north and south of Nevsky to cafe-hopping on restaurant-lined ul Rubinshteyna. By night, the district has just as much to offer, with some of the best bars in the city, particularly around the Liteyny area.
Slowly gentrifying Vosstaniya still feels a bit run-down, but is the closest Petersburg has to a creative and alternative culture hub, with art galleries, bars and clubs.

ALEXANDER NEVSKY MONASTERY
Named after the patron saint of St Petersburg who led the Russian victory over the Swedes in 1240, the Alexander Nevsky Monastery is the city’s oldest and most eminent religious institution. Today it is a working monastery that attracts scores of devout believers, as well as being the burial place of some of Russia’s most famous artistic figures.


e.o. / shutterstock ©
Historic Victory
Founding the monastery in 1710, Peter the Great sought to link St Petersburg to the historic battle against the Swedes, and thus to underscore Russia’s long history with the newly captured region. Even though the site of Nevsky’s victory was further upstream by the mouth of the Izhora River, the monastery became the centre of the Nevsky cult – his remains were transferred here from Vladimir in 1724 and remain the most sacred item in the cathedral here. In 1797 the monastery became a lavra, the most senior grade of Russian Orthodox monasteries.
Cemeteries
Coming into the monastery complex, you’ll first arrive at the opposing cemeteries, which hold the remains of some of Russia’s most famous names. You’ll find Dostoevsky, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Mussorgsky within the walls of the Necropolis of Art Masters (Некрополь Мастеров Искусств MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.gmgs.ru; Nevsky pr 179/2; incl Necropolis of the 18th Century R400; h9.30am-6pm May-Sep, 11am-4pm Oct-Apr; mPloshchad Aleksandra Nevskogo), which is on your right after you enter the monastery’s main gate. Across the way in the Necropolis of the 18th Century (Некрополь XVIII века MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2; incl Necropolis of Art Masters R400; h9.30am-6pm May-Sep, 11am-4pm Oct-Apr; mPloshchad Aleksandra Nevskogo), you’ll find far more graves, though fewer famous names – look out for polymath Mikhail Lomonosov and Natalya Lanskaya (Pushkin's wife) as well as the graves of the St Petersburg architects Quarenghi, Stasov and Rossi.
Monastery Complex
The monastery itself is within a further wall beyond the cemeteries. The centrepiece is the classical Holy Trinity Alexander Nevsky Lavra (Свято-Троицкая Александро-Невская Лавра MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2; h6am-9pm; mPloshchad Aleksandra Nevskogo), which was built between 1776 and 1790. Hundreds crowd in here on 12 September to celebrate the feast of St Alexander Nevsky, whose remains are in the silver reliquary by the elaborate main iconostasis, which you'll find to the right of the main altar, under a red and gold canopy. Behind the cathedral is the Nikolsky Cemetery ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2; h9.30am-6pm May-Sep, 11am-4pm Oct-Apr; mPloshchad Aleksandra Nevskogo), a beautiful spot with a little stream running through it, where more recently deceased Petersburgers can be found, including former mayor Anatoly Sobchak and murdered Duma deputy Galina Starovoytova.
Opposite the cathedral is the Metropolitan’s House ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2) (built 1775–78), the official residence of the spiritual leader of St Petersburg’s Russian Orthodox community. In the surrounding grounds is a smaller cemetery where leading Communist (ie atheist) Party officials and luminaries are buried. On the far right of the grounds facing the canal is St Petersburg’s Orthodox Academy ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2), one of only a handful in Russia (the main one is at Sergiev Posad, near Moscow).
Also on the grounds of the monastery is the State Museum of Urban Sculpture, which holds temporary exhibits of local artists’ work. Enter from outside the monastery walls off pl Alexandra Nevskogo.
Annunciation Church
Between the cemeteries and the main church, you'll pass a ticket kiosk with a separate admission to the old Annunciation Church ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 179/2; R150; h11am-5pm Tue, Wed & Fri-Sun; mPloschad Alexandra Nevskogo), aka the Blagoveshchenskaya Burial Vault. This was actually the sight of St Petersburg's first stone temple, completed in 1725, though it's been modified over the years. Intended as a burial chamber for the royal family, the ground floor today houses the remains of various minor royals, statesmen and tsarist generals. One of the most impressive tombs belongs to Alexander Golitsyn, who served as a governor of St Petersburg from 1780 to 1783. You'll also find the oldest tombstones in the monastery here – Ivan and Darya Ryevsky, who died in the early 1700s.
Upstairs, the former church today contains a collection of sculptures (dedicated to sorrow, early death and other uplifting topics). There are also a few documents related to the monastery's founding – note the intriguing early map of St Petersburg dating from 1753.
TOP TIPS

AYou can wander for free around most of the grounds and the main church, but you must buy tickets to enter the two most famous cemeteries as well as the Blagoveshchenskaya Burial Vault.
AThe route to the Nikolsky Cemetery is not signed. Take one of the passages on either side of Trinity Cathedral's main entrance – marked with туалет (toilet) signs.
AAt the Blagoveshchenskaya Burial Vault ask the docent for info in English, which is available on a small touchscreen in the corner.
Anyone wanting to visit the Trinity Catheral should dress respectfully (no shorts, or sleeveless tops, for example) and women should cover their heads before entering.
TAKE A BREAK

The monastery's on-site canteen (open 9am to 7pm) has snacks, as well as inexpensive cafeteria-style lunch fare from 1pm to 2pm.
For sandwiches, pastas and snacks, Bien Cafe & Bar ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 166; mains R340-480; h8am-11pm Mon-Fri, from 10am Sat & Sun; mPl Alexandra Nevskogo) is a 10-minute walk up Nevsky pr.

MUSEUM OF THE DEFENCE & BLOCKADE OF LENINGRADMUSEUM
(Музей обороны и блокады Ленинграда MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.blokadamus.ru; Solyarnoy per 9; R250, audio guide R300; h10am-6pm Thu-Mon, 12.30-8.30pm Wed; mChernyshevskaya)
The grim but engrossing displays here contain donations from survivors, propaganda posters from the blockade period and many photos depicting life and death during the siege. You'll see the meagre bread rations as they dwindled by the month, drawings made by children trying to cope with the loss of family members, and snapshots taken during Shostakovich's Symphony No.7 – composed and played during the siege (by famished musicians), to show the world that Leningrad was not down for the count.
There's decent English signage, though it's worth investing in the audio guide which delves deeper into the experience of life during those horrific 900 days. This museum opened just three months after the blockade was lifted in January 1944 and boasted 37,000 exhibits, including real tanks and aeroplanes. But three years later, during Stalin’s repression of the city, the museum was shut, its director shot, and most of the exhibits destroyed or redistributed. Not until 1985’s glasnost was an attempt made once again to gather documents to reopen the museum; this happened in 1989.
ANNA AKHMATOVA MUSEUM AT THE FOUNTAIN HOUSEMUSEUM
(Музей Анны Ахматовой в Фонтанном Доме MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.akhmatova.spb.ru; Liteyny pr 51; adult/child R120/free, audio guide R200; h10.30am-6.30pm Tue & Thu-Sun, noon-8pm Wed; mMayakovskaya)
Housed in the south wing of the Sheremetyev Palace, this touching and fascinating literary museum celebrates the life and work of Anna Akhmatova, St Petersburg’s most famous 20th-century poet. Akhmatova lived here from 1926 until 1952, invited by the art scholar Nikolai Punin, who lived in several rooms with his family. The two had a long-running affair, somewhat complicated by the tight living situation – Punin didn't want to separate from his wife.
The apartment is on the 2nd floor and is filled with mementos of the poet and correspondence with other writers, as well as elements from the life of Punin (like the overcoat hanging in the entry) and other boarders who lived here; sadly Punin would die in a gulag in 1953. A visit to this contemplative place also provides a glimpse of the interior of an (albeit atypical) apartment from the early to mid-20th century, even if relatively few pieces of original furniture have survived. Particularly moving is the study where, in her own words, Akhmatova 'quite unexpectedly' started her masterpiece Poem Without a Hero in 1940, and her living room where the poet had a famous all-night conversation with British diplomat Isaiah Berlin during the height of Stalinism, an event that had become legendary in Russian literary history. There are information panels in English in each room, as well as an audio guide available in English and several other languages.
Admission also includes the Josef Brodsky American Study. Brodsky did not live here, but his connection with Akhmatova was strong. For lack of a better location, his office has been recreated here, complete with furniture and other artifacts from his adopted home in Massachusetts. Funds are currently being collected to open a Josef Brodsky Museum at the poet's former home a few blocks away on Liteyny pr.
When coming to the museum, be sure to enter from Liteyny pr, rather than from the Fontanka River, where the main palace entrance is, as it's not possible to reach the museum from there.
RIMSKY-KORSAKOV FLAT-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Мемориальный музей-квартира Римского-Корсакова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-713 3208; www.theatremuseum.ru; Zagorodny pr 28; R100, audio guide R100; h11am-6pm Thu-Sun, 1-9pm Wed; mVladimirskaya)
Home of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov for the last 15 years of his life (1893–1908), this is where he composed 11 of his 15 operas, including the Fairy Tale of the Tsar Saltan and the Golden Rooster. The memorial flat (a branch of the State Museum of Theatre & Music) includes four rooms that have been lovingly restored to their original appearance.
A Becker grand piano graces the living room, played over the years by Rachmaninov, Glazunov, Scriabin, Stravinsky – and of course by Rimsky-Korsakov himself. The composer maintained a tradition of hosting musical soirées at his home; this tradition continues today, with periodic concerts (although you are unlikely to see Chaliapin perform here today). Enter from the courtyard.
MUSEUM OF THE ARCTIC & ANTARCTICMUSEUM
(Музей Арктики и Антарктики MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.polarmuseum.sp.ru; ul Marata 24A; adult/child R300/80; h10am-6pm Wed-Sun; mVladimirskaya)
This museum is devoted to polar expeditions, wildlife, cultures and history. The enormous collection includes scientific equipment, maps, taxidermy, photographs, clothing and artefacts from polar cultures. Apart from the stuffed polar bears and emperor penguins, the most impressive exhibit is a 1930s wooden seaplane hanging from the ceiling, used during the Soviet exploration of the 'Red North' under Stalin. As you'd expect there's a strong focus on Soviet polar exploration, and there's very little signage in English.
Its location in the former Old Believers’ Church of St Nicholas is not well disguised, and the premises are very impressive, especially the upper floor, a round gallery overlooked by a crumbling cupola.
SMOLNY CATHEDRALCHURCH
(Смольный собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-577 1421; pl Rastrelli 3/1; belltower adult/child R150/50; hchurch 7am-8pm, bell-tower 10am-6pm; mChernyshevskaya)
If baroque is your thing, then look no further than the sky-blue Smolny Cathedral, an unrivalled masterpiece of the genre that ranks among Bartolomeo Rastrelli’s most amazing creations. The cathedral is the centrepiece of a convent mostly built to Rastrelli’s designs between 1748 and 1757. His inspiration was to combine baroque details with the forest of towers and onion domes typical of an old Russian monastery. You'll get a fascinating perspective over the church and city beyond from the 63m-high belltower.
There’s special genius in the proportions of the cathedral (it gives the impression of soaring upwards), to which the convent buildings are a perfect foil. In stark contrast, the interior is a rather austere plain white as Rastrelli fell from favour before he was able to begin work on it. Recent years, however, have seen ongoing restoration and the transformation of the cathedral (used as a concert hall and exhibition space) back into a working church.

(Шереметьевский дворец MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-272 4441; www.theatremuseum.ru; nab reki Fontanki 34; one/two exhibitions R300/370; h11am-7pm Thu-Mon, 1-9pm Wed; mGostiny Dvor)
Splendid wrought-iron gates facing the Fontanka River guard the entrance to the Sheremetyev Palace (built 1750–55), now a branch of the State Museum of Theatre & Music, which has a collection of musical instruments from the 19th and 20th centuries. The Sheremetyev family was famous for the concerts and theatre performances they hosted at their palace, which was a centre of musical life in the imperial capital.
Upstairs, you'll find a lovely collection of 18th-century mahogany furniture, Italian renaissance paintings and rare instruments (including a grand piano that belonged to Glinka), spread among handsomely restored rooms. The most impressive, such as the green drawing room, were designed in second empire baroque style. The ground floor is given over to an enormous collection of more instruments (separate admission fee), but is probably only of great interest to collectors.
MUSEUM OF DECORATIVE & APPLIED ARTSMUSEUM
(Музей прикладного искусства MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-273 3258; www.spbghpa.ru; Solyanoy per 15; adult/student R300/150, excursion in Russian R2000; h11am-5pm Tue-Sat; mChernyshevskaya)
Also known as the Stieglitz Museum, this fascinating establishment is as beautiful as you would expect a decorative arts museum to be. An array of gorgeous objects is on display, from medieval furniture to 18th-century Russian tiled stoves and contemporary works by the students of the Applied Arts School (also housed here). This museum is less visited than some of its counterparts in the city, but the quiet atmosphere only adds to its appeal.
In 1878 the millionaire Baron Stieglitz founded the School of Technical Design and wanted to surround his students with world-class art to inspire them. He began a collection that was continued by his son and was to include a unique array of European and Oriental glassware, porcelains, tapestries, furniture and paintings. It eventually grew into one of Europe’s richest private collections. Between 1885 and 1895, a building designed by architect Maximilian Messmacher was built to house the collection and this building also became a masterpiece. Each hall is decorated in its own unique style, including Italian, Renaissance, Flemish and baroque. The Terem Room, in the style of the medieval Terem Palace of Moscow’s Kremlin, is an opulent knockout.
After the revolution the school was closed, the museum’s collection redistributed to the Hermitage and the Russian Museum, and most of the lavish interiors were brutally painted or plastered over or even destroyed (one room was used as a sports hall). The painstaking renovation continues to this day, despite receiving no state funding.
To find the museum, take the second entrance to the Academy as you walk up Solyanoy per from ul Pestelya. After buying tickets, head up the main staircase, turn right at the top, walk through two halls and then go down the lovely fresco-covered staircase to your left. Once you've visited the museum, feel free to wander around the grand halls and corridors of the Applied Arts School. If you continue the way you came to get to the museum and turn right you'll get to the school's main hall, with its signature skylights, where exhibitions of students' work are often held.
CATHEDRAL OF THE TRANSFIGURATION OF OUR SAVIOURCATHEDRAL
(Спасо-Преображенский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Preobrazhenskaya pl; h8am-8pm; mChernyshevskaya)
The interior of this marvellous 1743 cathedral, which has been beautifully restored and repainted both outside and in, is one of the most gilded in the city. The grand gates bear the imperial double-headed eagle in vast golden busts, reflecting the fact that the cathedral was built on the site where the Preobrazhensky Guards (the monarch’s personal protection unit) had their headquarters.
Architect Vasily Stasov rebuilt the cathedral from 1827 to 1829 in the neoclassical style. It is dedicated to the victory over the Turks in 1828–29; note the captured Turkish cannons, wrapped in chains, in the gate surrounding the cathedral.
SMOLNY INSTITUTEHISTORIC BUILDING
(Смольный институт MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Proletarskoy Diktatury 3; mChernyshevskaya)
Built by Giacomo Quarenghi between 1806 and 1808 as a school for aristocratic girls, the Smolny Institute was thrust into the limelight in 1917 when it became the headquarters for the Bolshevik Central Committee and the Petrograd Soviet. From here, Trotsky and Lenin directed the October Revolution, and in the Hall of Acts (Aktovy zal) on 25 October, the All-Russian Congress of Soviets conferred power on a Bolshevik government led by Lenin.
The Smolny Institute served as the seat of Soviet power until March 1918, when the capital was relocated to Moscow. In 1934, the powerful Leningrad Party chief Sergei Kirov was assassinated in its corridors, on orders from Stalin, ridding the Soviet leader of a perceived rival and simultaneously providing the perfect pretext for the notorious Leningrad purges. Today St Petersburg’s governor continues to run the city from here. Although it's closed to the public, some of the big tour companies, such as SPB Tours (www.spb-tours.com), include a short visit inside the Smolny Institute on multiday tours around St Petersburg.
TAURIDE PALACE & GARDENSPARK
(Таврический дворец и сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h8am-8pm Aug-Mar, to 10pm May-Jul, closed Apr; mChernyshevskaya)
Catherine the Great had this baroque palace built in 1783 for Grigory Potemkin, a famed general and her companion for many years. Today it is home to the Commonwealth of Independent States and is closed to the public. The gardens, on the other hand, are open to all; once the romping grounds of the tsarina, they became a park for the people under the Soviets, and their facilities include a lake, several cafes and an entertainment centre.
The palace was named after Tavria (another name for Crimea, the region that Potemkin conquered) and was a thank-you present to Potemkin from Catherine. Catherine’s bitter son, Paul I, turned the palace into a barracks after his ascension to the throne in 1796, which ruined most of the lavish interiors. Between 1906 and 1917 the State Duma, the Provisional Government and the Petrograd Soviet all met here; in the 1930s it housed the All-Union Agricultural Communist University, a fate that would have no doubt horrified Catherine the Great.
GOLITSYN LOFTCULTURAL CENTRE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reky Fontanki 20; mGostiny Dvor)
The new epicentre of creativity on the Fontanka River is this mazelike complex of shops, bars, cafes, beauty salons, tattoo parlours, galleries and even a hostel with capsule-style bunks. Enter via the archway into a large courtyard, which is spread with outdoor eating and drinking spots in the summer, then head up any of the stairwells into the five buildings for a bit of urban exploration. On weekends the centre stages one-off events, such as craft markets, concerts and film screenings.
According to legend, literary salons were held here in the early 1800s and Pushkin was a regular guest – some claim he even wrote his political screed 'Volnost' ('Freedom') in the rooms today occupied by the Ziferburg cafe.

(Ленинград центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-242 9999; www.leningradcenter.ru; Potyomkinskaya ul 4; hnoon-1am; W; mChernyshevskaya)
This new high-tech entertainment complex houses two theatres, a gallery, a top-floor restaurant and two bars on the ground floor. It's set in a former mansion that was converted into a massive cinema during the Soviet era. In 2014, the building reopened in its present form and hosts a wide-ranging repertoire of concerts, dance performances, musical theatre and film screenings. You can't miss the video wall in the foyer – said to be the largest in Europe.
It's worth stopping by if passing through the area. Most exhibitions in the gallery are free.
BOLSHOY DOMHISTORIC BUILDING
(Большой дом MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Liteyny pr 4; mChernyshevskaya)
Noi Trotsky’s monolithic design for the local KGB headquarters (and currently the St Petersburg headquarters of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, its successor organisation) is referred to by everyone as the ‘Bolshoy Dom’ or ‘Big House’. It’s a fierce-looking block of granite built in 1932 in the late-constructivist style and was once a byword for fear among the people of the city: most people who were taken here during the purges were never heard from again. Obviously, the building is not open to the public.
Employees who have worked here include Vladimir Putin during his KGB career. The Bolshoy Dom made the news in 2010, when the subversive art collective Voina (War) drew a 65m-long penis on the nearby Liteyny Bridge, which, when the bridge was raised, made a very clear statement towards the FSB.
ANNA AKHMATOVA MONUMENTMONUMENT
(Памятник Анне Ахматовой MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab Robespierre; mChernyshevskaya)
This moving statue of St Petersburg’s most famous 20th-century poet was unveiled in 2006, across the river from the notorious Kresty holding prison, to mark the 40th anniversary of Akhmatova’s death. The location is no coincidence – Kresty Prison was where Akhmatova herself queued for days in the snow for news of her son after his multiple arrests during Stalin’s terror.
The inscription on the monument comes from her epic poem ‘Requiem’, in which she describes life during the purges. It reads: ‘That’s why I pray not for myself/But for all of you who stood there with me/Through fiercest cold and scorching July heat/Under a towering, completely blind red wall.’
MONUMENT TO THE VICTIMS OF POLITICAL REPRESSIONMONUMENT
(Памятник жертвам политических репрессий MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab Robespierre; mChernyshevskaya)
This gruesome piece of sculpture by Russian artist Mikhail Shemyakin was unveiled in 1995, shortly after the end of the Soviet Union, and during a time of relative lustration. The scultpure is centred on two sphinxes, both of which look, from one side, like beautiful creatures. However, view them from the other side (facing the infamous Kresty Prison across the water) and it's clear the beauty has been corrupted beyond recognition and half the face is a mere skull.
Lines of writing from many of the Soviet system's victims are engraved on the monument's granite base. It's a sad and deeply moving place.

This now legendary locale is a former apartment block – affectionately called by its street address despite the fact that the public entrance is actually on Ligovsky pr – that contains studio and gallery space, as well as music clubs Fish Fabrique and Fabrique Nouvelle, plus an assortment of other shops and galleries. It offers a unique opportunity to hang out with local musicians and artists, who are always eager to talk about their work.
One ticket gives admission to all the galleries.

Named after Sergey Kuryokhin (1954–96), a legend of the Russian contemporary arts and music scene, this is the temporary home of the arts centre until its new home on Vasilevsky Island is ready (late 2019). You can view some of the talented avant-garde artist's work and that of his contemporaries including the band Kino and performance artist Vladislav Mamyshev-Monroe. You can also see exhibitions of new works that push the artistic boundaries.

WORTH A DETOUR
THE SOVIET SOUTH

Sprawling southern St Petersburg was once planned to be the centre of Stalin’s new Leningrad, and anyone interested in Stalinist architecture should make the easy trip down here to the Moskovskaya metro station for a wander around and to see a clutch of sights all within easy walking distance.
HOUSE OF SOVIETSNOTABLE BUILDING
(Дом советов GOOGLE MAP ; Moskovsky pr 212; mMoskovskaya)
Right outside the Moskovskaya metro station you’ll see the House of Soviets, a staggeringly bombastic Stalinist beauty. Planned to be the central administrative building of Stalin’s Leningrad, it was built with the leader’s neoclassical tastes in mind. Begun by Noi Trotsky in 1936, it was not finished until after the war, by which time the architect had been purged. Nonetheless, this magnificent, sinister building is a great example of Stalinist design, with its columns and bas-reliefs and an enormous frieze running across the top. Today it houses the Moskovsky Region’s local administration and is closed to the public.
MONUMENT TO THE HEROIC DEFENDERS OF LENINGRADMONUMENT
(Монумент героическим защитникам Ленинграда GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; pl Pobedy; R200; h10am-6pm Thu-Mon, until 5pm Tue; mMoskovskaya)
Due south of the House of Soviets, on Moskovsky pr is this awe-inspiring monument. Centred around a 48m-high obelisk, the monument, unveiled in 1975, is a sculptural ensemble of bronze statues symbolising the city’s encirclement and eventual victory in WWII. On a lower level, a second bronze ring 40m in diameter surrounds a very moving sculpture standing in the centre. Haunting symphonic music creates a sombre atmosphere to guide you downstairs to the underground exhibition in a huge, mausoleum-like interior.
Here, the glow of 900 bronze lamps creates an eeriness matched by the sound of a metronome (the only sound heard by Leningraders on their radios throughout the war save for emergency announcements), showing that the city’s heart was still beating. Twelve thematically assembled showcases feature items from the war and siege. An electrified relief map in the centre of the room shows the shifting front lines of the war.
PARK POBEDYPARK
( GOOGLE MAP ; Moskovsky pr; h6am-midnight; mPark Pobedy)
This large green space gathers a cross-section of Petersburgers, including young families, teens and canoodling couples who stroll the leafy paths and enjoy the views over the ponds and flower gardens. Built to celebrate Russia’s victory in WWII, the park is full of statues of Soviet war heroes and has a beneficent depiction of Lenin interacting with small children. To get to the Park, walk 1.7km north up Moskovsky pr, or hop on a bus or tram heading north.

Russia in all its grit and glory – from the industrial sprawl of Magnitogorsk to the glittering domes of Moscow – is on full display at this vast recreation of the motherland in miniature. One huge room contains mountains, cities, rivers and lakes, with lots of mechanised action that you can observe while strolling around the perimeter of the varied landscape. Tiny trains shuttle around the countryside, helicopters ascend, and trucks and cars move across bridges, up mountain roads and along industrial sites.
The level of detail is staggering, from the spot-on recreations of Soviet-style apartment blocks, to the clothing worn by waiting passengers at the train depot. It's hard not to be charmed by this ambitious, miniaturised work of art.

Fyodor Dostoevsky lived in flats all over the city (mostly in Sennaya), but his final residence is this ‘memorial flat’ where he lived from 1878 until he died in 1881. The apartment remains as it was when the Dostoevsky family lived here, including the study where he wrote The Brothers Karamazov, and the office of Anna Grigorievna, his wife, who recopied, edited and sold all of his books.
The objects here include an image of Raphael's Sistine Virgin, which Doestoevsky was quite fond of; a clock that belonged to Dostoevsky's younger brother, which shows the hour and time when Dostoevsky died; and various family photos (including Dostoevsky's daughter Liubov Fyodorovna, who also became a writer). Apart from the six-room flat, there are two other rooms devoted to his novels, his travels and his legacy. A rather gloomy sculpted likeness of the man himself (as if there’s any other kind) is just outside the nearby Vladimirskaya metro station.

In a once-industrial part of the city, Lumiere Hall hosts large-format multimedia exhibitions – basically massive 3D projections in a 360-degree space, with audio commentary on the works displayed and the artists behind the creations. Take a seat on beanbags and enjoy the show. Recent installations have included projections of paintings by Ivan Aivazovsky, Van Gogh and Gustav Klimt. It's a 1km walk from the metro station. Head up to the canal and turn right.
On Friday and Saturday, Lumiere Hall also has late-night screenings of popular Hollywood and foreign films. These kick off around 11.30pm.
VLADIMIRSKY CATHEDRALCATHEDRAL
(Владимирский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Vladimirsky pr 20; h8am-6pm, services 6pm daily; mVladimirskaya)
This fantastic, five-domed cathedral, ascribed to Domenico Trezzini, is the namesake of this neighbourhood. Incorporating both baroque and neoclassical elements, the cathedral was built in the 1760s, with Giacomo Quarenghi’s neoclassical belltower added later in the century. One famous member of the congregation was Dostoevsky, who lived around the corner. The cathedral was closed in 1932 and the Soviets turned it into an underwear factory, but in 1990 it was reconsecrated and resumed its originally intended function.
The baroque iconostasis was originally installed in the private chapel of the Anichkov Palace, but was transferred here in 1808. For an impressive perspective on the onion domes, have a drink in Birreria across the road.
MUSEUM OF THE IMPERIAL PORCELAIN FACTORYMUSEUM

Run as an outpost of the Hermitage, this superb museum has a stellar display of the various designs the factory has produced over the centuries and will appeal to anyone interested in this very Russian handicraft. Among the collection you'll find everything from bespoke dinner services used by the tsars to unique constructivist tea sets created in the 1920s, indicative of the factory's versatility in serving its various political masters.
Don't miss the exquisite collection of porcelain statuettes depicting the various peoples of Russia and beyond, with clothing so beautifully rendered it looks like fabric. There's also a porcelain shop here where prices are slightly lower compared to the factory's city-centre outlets. To get here, turn left out of the metro station and walk under the bridge. Turn left on the embankment and you’ll see the factory ahead.
DERZHAVIN HOUSE-MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей-усадьба Державина GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Fontanki 118; adult/student R300/200; h10am-6pm Wed & Fri-Mon, noon-8pm Thu; mTekhnologichesky Institut)
This grand old Petersburg residence was the home to court poet Gabriel Derzhavin (1743–1816), one of Russia's greatest early writers, who recognised the genius of Alexander Pushkin during Pushkin's own childhood. Having been divided into some 60 communal apartments under the Soviets, the mansion was fully renovated in 2003 and is now a charming museum. The focus of the house is Derzhavin's own study, with its three secret entrances.
After exploring the house, you can take a stroll in the pretty gardens with its little bridges and tiny canals; you can also enter the greenery via Derzhavinksy per.
STATE MUSEUM OF URBAN SCULPTUREMUSEUM

Despite the name, this two-storey gallery typically has more than just sculpture on display at its changing exhibitions. You may find paintings, video art and mixed media – most of which are created by avant-garde St Petersburg artists. There are a few sculptures in front of the gallery – and occasional installations tucked in the museum courtyard (staff will be sure to take you there if so). Enter from just outside the monastery walls off pl Alexandra Nevskogo.

(Троицкий собор GOOGLE MAP ; Izmailovsky pr 7A; h9am-7pm Mon-Sat, 8am-8pm Sun, services 10am daily & 5pm Fri-Sun; mTekhnologichesky Institut)
The Trinity Cathedral boasts stunning blue cupolas emblazoned with golden stars. A devastating fire in 2006 caused the 83m-high central cupola to collapse, but it has been fully restored and now looks even better than it did before. Construction of the vast cathedral began in 1828, according to a design by Vasily Stasov. The cathedral was consecrated in 1835 and functioned as the chapel for the Izmailovsky Guards, who were garrisoned next door.
In honour of the Russian victory in the Russo-Turkish War in 1878, the memorial Column of Glory was constructed out of 128 Turkish cannons. (The present monument was erected on the north side of the cathedral in 2003: it is an exact replica of the original, which was destroyed by Stalin.)
The cathedral was famed for its immense collection of icons, as well as several silver crosses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. After the revolution, most of these treasures were looted, the ornate interiors were destroyed and the cathedral was finally closed in 1938.
Trinity Cathedral was returned to the Orthodox Church in 1990, but the interior is decidedly bare, especially compared with its previous appearance. It was here that Fyodor Dostoevsky married his second wife, Anna Snitkina, in 1867.

TARTARBARRUSSIAN$$
(Тартарбар MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %911-922 5606; www.tartarbar.ru; Vilensky per 15; mains R450-650; h1pm-midnight)
The same team behind the celebrated Duo Gastrobar recently opened this clever dining space to showcase a creative menu of small plates. Rawness features in various forms (lamb tartare, tuna ceviche, beef carpaccio), though you'll also find grilled octopus, oxtail with morels, and flounder in garlic sauce.
The eclectic setting mixes exposed brick and mid-century Scandinavian furnishings with artful whimsy – concrete panels with plants dangling over the side.
VSYO NA SVYOM MESTYEINTERNATIONAL$$
(Всё на Своём Месте MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-932 0256; Liteyny pr 7; mains R380-740; hnoon-midnight)
A hip little gastrobar with warm ambiance, tables made of converted sewing machines, and a record player providing the tunes. Stop in for creative market-fresh fare, which might include cod filet on cauliflower purée, ramen soup, or polenta with roast chicken and oyster mushrooms – all goes nicely with the craft brews and easygoing vibe.
KVARTIRA KOSTI KROITSAINTERNATIONAL$$
(Квартира Кости Кройца MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kreutzflat.com; 5th fl, apt 8, ul Marata 1, 921-651 7788; mains R450-730; h24hr; Wv; mMayakovskaya)
A beautifully designed bourgeois hideaway, Kvartira Kosti comprises a stylish restaurant with views over Nevsky pr, a small handsomely designed bar, and a surprising tea salon tucked in the back, with a stained-glass skylight and elegant furnishings set amid a circular room. The menu features Asian-style noodle dishes, creative salads, risotto, fish and chips, and a full breakfast lineup.
The big draw, though, is the secretive setting. You need to reserve ahead, and then you'll have to call/text to receive a code and instructions that give access to the building. There's also one plush apartment adjoining the restaurant, though you'll have to share the bathroom (shower attached) with the restaurant guests.

This self-termed 'art cafe' is tucked into a tiny basement, its two rooms crowded with mismatched furniture, musical instruments, carefully posed mannequins and lots of other junk (or ‘art’), creating a bohemian atmosphere. The European menu has a hearty selection of meat and fish, with plenty of Russian classics, plus the odd Asian dish to spice things up.
There is live music nightly at 8.30pm.

In a city awash with wannabe Japanese restaurants, this large and lively operation is one of the most authentic, with a wide range of sushi, sashimi, kebabs, tempura and bento box lunches. A photo menu makes ordering no hassle at all, and their homemade beer is an excellent accompaniment to any meal.

The best seats are on the terrace overlooking the city outside, but you'll need to reserve ahead for these.

Inspired by the cookbook of Elena Molokhovets, the menu at 'Molokhovets' Dream' covers all the classics from borsch to beef stroganoff, as well as less frequently seen dishes such as venison tenderloin with juniper sauce or wild mushrooms with sour cream and pickled onions. Whatever you have here, you can be sure it’s the definitive version.

(Палкинъ MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-703 5371; www.palkin.ru; Nevsky pr 47; mains R1200-3700; hnoon-midnight; Wc; mMayakovskaya)
This historic restaurant, which has roots dating back to 1785, evokes a touch of royal grandeur with its elegantly set dining room, exquisite cuisine and rather theatrical service. Start off with caviar or foie gras, before moving on to grilled Ladoga white fish or beef Stroganoff a la Palkin.

(Блок MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-415 4040; www.blok.restaurant; Potyomkinskaya ul 4; mains R750-5800; hnoon-1am; W; mChernyshevskaya)
On the top floor of the Leningrad Centre, Blok aims to dazzle with big, bold artworks, a sculptural chandelier running down the glass-covered ceiling, and two terraces with sweeping skyline views. None of this detracts from the star of the show: perfectly grilled steak, which comes in 23 varieties – including muromets, a tender perfection which is dry-aged in house.

Always crowded and spilling out into the street, this Israel-themed eatery and drinking den lures hip and joyful people with its creative cocktails, Israeli Shiraz and the best falafel wraps this side of the Baltic Sea. Other culinary temptations include sabich salad (with eggplant, egg, hummus and tahini), appetiser spreads with baba ghanoush and pitas, and rather imaginative matzah pizzas.
BGL CAFE & MARKETBAGELS$

Finally, somewhere decent to enjoy bagels! This sunny little cafe is popular with a young, well-read crowd, and has a great location overlooking the Fontanka River.

The converted industrial space has an airy interior, with plants and other organic elements, and an excellent-value menu.
GREY'SBISTRO$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.greys-bistro.ru; Konnaya ul 5/3; mains R380-580; h11am-11pm; W; mPl Vosstaniya)
The name may be literal (the walls are an understated light grey that complements the dark timber floors and stylish lighting), but the food is far from dour. Grey's excels at uncomplicated classics like fish soup, homemade roasts, rack of lamb and grilled trout, along with popular desserts like berry tart – all quite reasonably priced.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-640 1616; 6th fl, Stremyannaya ul 21; mains R560-1290; hnoon-1am; Wv; mVladimiriskaya)
On the top floor of the Olympic Plaza shopping complex, Gastronomika is the go-to spot for a wide-ranging menu of pizzas, barbecue brisket, Asian noodle soups and salmon or halibut with rich sauces. The cooking gets solid reviews, but the real draw is the outstanding view over the rooftops of St Petersburg.
A party vibe prevails on weekends, when DJs spin from 9pm onward, and diners receive a welcome drink.

(Вкус Есть GOOGLE MAP ; %812-983 3376; http://tastetoeat.tastetoeat.ru; nab reki Fontanki 82; mains R480-680; h1-11pm; W)

True to its name, this hip little place takes diners on a culinary journey around the globe, with a standout menu of Singapore-style noodles with seafood, Szechuan beef with jasmine rice and Thai coconut soup, plus plenty of Russian classics (like homemade dumplings).
An equally eclectic soundtrack, vintage travel posters, and a huge cocktail menu all set the stage for a fine start to the night. DJs spin on Friday and Saturday nights (from 9pm).

‘Happiness’ comes in several forms here: a multiroomed venue full of cosy nooks and crannies to huddle up in, an expansive Italian menu, delicious pastries and tempting sweets, and lavish and thoroughly warm (if somewhat random) decor (think jars full of pasta and photo frames with stock shots of family members).

On the fourth floor of the posh Galeria shopping center, Baklazhan is yet another success from the Ginza chain.

Baklazhan (eggplant) plays a starring role in tasty roasted eggplant salads and stuffed eggplant with cheese.
A GIFT TO YOUNG HOUSEWIVES

The most popular cookbook in 19th-century Russia was called A Gift to Young Housewives, a collection of favourite recipes and household management tips that turned into a bestseller. The author, Elena Molokhovets, a housewife herself, was dedicated to her 10 children, to the Orthodox Church, and to her inexperienced ‘female compatriots’ who might need assistance keeping their homes running smoothly.
This book was reprinted 28 times between 1861 and 1914, and Molokhovets added new recipes and helpful hints to each new edition. The last edition included literally thousands of recipes, as well as pointers on how to organise an efficient kitchen, how to set a proper table and how to clean a cast-iron pot.
Molokhovets received an enormously positive response from readers who credited her with no less than preserving their family life. The popular perception of the time was that a wife’s primary responsibility was to keep her family together, and keeping her husband well fed seemed to be the key. As one reader wrote, ‘A good kitchen is…not an object of luxury. It is a token of the health and well-being of the family, upon which all the remaining conditions of life depend’. Molokhovets included some of these letters in later editions as testimony to her work.
The classic cookbook was never reprinted during the Soviet period. The details of sumptuous dishes and fine table settings – let alone questions of etiquette and style – would certainly have been considered bourgeois by the Soviet regime. Yet still, copies of this ancient tome survived, passed down from mother to daughter like a family heirloom. Today, the book reads not only as a cookbook, but also as a lesson in history and sociology.
6DRINKING & NIGHTLIFE

oUNION BAR & GRILLBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/barunion; Liteyny pr 55; h6pm-4am Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat; W; mMayakovskaya)
The Union is a glamorous and fun place, characterised by one enormous long wooden bar, low lighting and a New York feel. It's all rather adult, with a serious cocktail list and designer beers on tap. The hip 20- and 30-something crowd packs in on weekends to catch live bands, but it's generally quiet during the week.
There's good snack fare (burgers, hummus with pita, shawarma) from the grill in the back room, and a tiny rear patio for the smoking crowd.
oHATBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Belinskogo 9; h7pm-5am; mGostiny Dvor)
The wonderfully retro-feeling Hat is a serious spot for jazz and whiskey lovers, who come for the nightly live music and the cool cat crowd that makes this wonderfully designed bar feel like it's been transported out of 1950s Greenwich Village. A very welcome change of gear for St Petersburg's drinking options, but it can be extremely packed at weekends.
oCOMMODEBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.commode.club; ul Rubinshteyna 1, 2nd fl; per hr R180; h4pm-2am Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat)
Stopping in for drinks at Commode feels more like hanging out in an upper-class friend's stylish apartment. After getting buzzed up, you can hang out in various high-ceilinged rooms, catch a small concert or poetry slam, browse books in the quasi-library room, play a round of table football, or chat with the easygoing crowd that have fallen for the place.
Drink and snack prices and are kept low (cocktails run R100 to R150), but you'll pay by the hour – not unlike an anticafe – for time spent at this so-called self-cost bar.
oREDRUMBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-416 1126; www.facebook.com/redrumbarspb; ul Nekrasova 26; h4pm-1am Sun-Thu, to 3am Fri & Sat; mMayakovskaya)
One of St Petersburg's best drinking dens, Redrum hits all the right notes. It has a cosy, white brick interior, a welcoming, easygoing crowd, and a stellar selection of craft brews (some two dozen on tap). There's also good pub fare on hand to go with that creative line-up of Session Indian Pale Ales, sour ales, Berliner Weisse and porters.
Have a seat at the small circular bar and get ordering tips from the friendly bartenders, who will be happy to point you in the right direction.
DEAD POETS BARCOCKTAIL BAR

This very cool place has a sophisticated drinks menu and an almost unbelievable range of spirits stacked along the long bar and served up by a committed staff of mixologists. It's more of a quiet place, with low lighting, a jazz soundtrack and plenty of space to sit down.
TERMINAL BARBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Belinskogo 11; h2pm-4am; W; mMayakovskaya)
A slice of New York bohemia on one of the city’s most happening streets, Terminal is great for a relaxed drink with friends, in a small, intimate setting. Bar staff take their cocktails seriously.
MISHKABAR
(Мишка MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/bar.mishka; nab reki Fontanki 40; h6pm-2am Mon-Thu, 2pm-6am Fri-Sun; W; mGostiny Dvor)
Hipster ground zero in St Petersburg is this two-room basement place that is massively popular with a cool student crowd. The frenetic front room becomes a dancefloor later in the evening, while the quiet backroom is a chill-out area. DJs spin nightly and there's a big cocktail list.
BAR 812COCKTAIL BAR

FREEDOMANTICAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Nevsky pr 88; per min R2; hnoon-midnight Sun-Thu, until 6am Fri & Sat; W; mMayakovskaya)
In a courtyard off Nevsky pr, this very popular anticafe is spacious and friendly and full of rooms where you can play board games, watch TV, hang out and meet like-minded boho types.
There are occasional music jams, and a piano and guitar if you wish to play.
ZIFERBURGANTICAFE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Fontanki 20; per min R3; h11am-midnight; mGostiny Dvor)
Tucked inside the Golitsyn Loft, this is one of St Petersburg's loveliest spots to while away an afternoon. Elegant furnishings, huge windows and a piano in the corner set the scene. Like other anti-cafes, you'll pay by the minute, with drinks and cookies part of the deal.
The price tops out at R540, meaning you won't pay more than that even if you spend all day here.
FARSH & BOCHKABAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.beercard.ru; ul Belinskogo 11; h5pm-midnight Mon-Thu, noon-2am Fri & Sat, noon-midnight Sun)
On bar-lined ul Belinskogo, Farsh & Bochka stands out for its wide-ranging line-up of craft brews, with over 30 on draft, including SPB and Russian varieties. It's a noisy, buzzing place – a fine spot to catch a game or have a low-key night while sipping a full-bodied Vienna-style lager and munching on barbecued meats, rosemary fries or shrimp tacos.
PIVNAYA KARTABAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.beercard.ru; ul Vosstaniya 55; hnoon-11pm; mChernyshevskaya)
A mecca for beer lovers, Pivnaya Karta has over 400 varieties of beer from around the globe, with some 20 different rotating draft selections. That said, it's a small stand-up space that feels more bottle shop than bar, and of interest for only a small slice of SPB society.
DRINKS WITH A VIEW

SKY BARBAR
( GOOGLE MAP ; Top fl, Hotel Azimut, Lermontovsky pr 43/1; h5pm-1am; W; mBaltiyskaya)
The top floor of the Soviet-era Azimut Hotel, one of the city's biggest eyesores, is also home to the Sky Bar, quite simply the best place to get a bird's-eye view of the city. Taking up much of the 18th floor, the bar has plenty of space to sit back and enjoy the incredible view of the historic centre through its vast floor-to-ceiling windows. In addition to cocktails and coffee, there's also a full food menu.
Even the nearest metro is some distance away, however, so it's best to wander here along the Fontanka from the centre.
6Vladimirskaya & Vosstaniya
oZIFERBLATANTICAFE

A charming multiroom 'free space' that has started a worldwide trend, Ziferblat is the original anticafe in St Petersburg. Coffee, tea, soft drinks and biscuits are included as you while away your time playing chess and other board games, reading, playing instruments (help yourself to the piano and guitar) or just hanging out with the arty young locals who frequent its cosy rooms.
The unsigned entrance is hard to find. Look for the big #81 sign on Nevsky pr, then find the door with buzzers just east of there. Ring Циферблат (labelled in Russian only).
BEER GEEKCRAFT BEER

Duck into the courtyard to find this very cosy basement bar that's recommended by local beer fanatics for its regularly updated range of 12 local and international craft ales on tap and curated selection of bottles to drink in or take out.
Sit either on the couple of stools at the bar or on some wooden tiered steps alongside three cuddly toy tigers and a moose!

What looks like a small suburban house sits rather incongruously here amid repurposed warehouses in this vast courtyard. There’s a cosy indoor bar and a sand-covered outside area with table football and ping pong, which keeps the cool kids happy all night in the summer months. To find it, simply continue 300m in a straight line from the courtyard entrance on Ligovsky pr.
DJs spin from Wednesdays to Sundays, with the odd band from time to time.
FISH FABRIQUE NOUVELLELIVE MUSIC
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.fishfabrique.spb.ru; Ligovsky pr 53; h3pm-late; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
This legendary bar is set in the building that’s the focus of the avant-garde art scene – it attracts an interesting crowd who give this cramped space its edge. Live bands kick up a storm most nights around 10pm.
ETO BARBAR
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Vladimirsky per 14; h6pm-2am Sun-Thu, to 6am Fri & Sat; mVladimirskaya)
An easygoing newcomer to the nightlife scene, Eto is a cosy, brick-walled space with a wooden bar (recycled from the theatre stage next door) and live music nightly from 9pm to midnight. Stop in for good wines by the glass (from R270), classic cocktails and an eclectic lineup of jazz, blues and rockabilly.
If you play an instrument, ask about joining in. Look for the archway entrance just visible from the street.
GRIBOYEDOVCLUB
(Грибоедов MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.griboedovclub.ru; Voronezhskaya ul 2a; hnoon-6am Mon-Fri, from 2pm Sat & Sun; W; mLigovsky Prospekt)
Griboyedov is hands-down the longest-standing and most respected music club in the city. Housed in a repurposed bomb shelter, this one was founded by local ska collective Dva Samolyota. It’s a low-key bar in the early evening, gradually morphing into a dance club later in the night. Admission varies from free to upwards of R400, depending on who's playing or spinning.
BIRRERIABAR
(Биррерия MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.facebook.com/birreriaspb; 2nd fl, Vladimirsky pr 19, Vladimirsky Passage; hnoon-2am; mVladimirskaya)
On the second floor of the Vladimirsky Passage shopping complex, this upscale place has an excellent line-up of Belgian, German and English beers on tap and far more selections by the bottle. Good bistro fare and great views of the Vladimirsky Cathedral.
NA ZDOROVYE!

‘To your health!’ is what Russians say when they throw back a shot of vodka. But this pronouncement hardly suffices as a proper toast in a public forum or an intimate drinking session among friends. A proper toast requires thoughtfulness and sincerity.
A few themes prevail. The first toast of the night often acknowledges the generosity of the host, while the second usually recognises the beauty of the ladies present. In mixed company, you can’t go wrong raising your glass to international friendship (za mezhdunarodnuyu druzhbu) or world peace (za miravoy mir). But in all cases, the toast requires a personal anecdote or a profound insight, as well as a bit of rambling preamble to make it meaningful.
In Russia, drinking vodka is a celebration of life in all its complexity – the triumph, the tragedy and the triviality. A toast is a vocalisation of that celebration, so say it like you mean it. And drink it in the same way – zalpom – bottoms up!

Nowadays, the newer Fabrique Nouvelle in the same courtyard hosts concerts nightly, while the old Fish Fabrique only has them on weekends; whichever one you’re in, you’re sure to rub shoulders with an interesting crowd.

Lots of silly fun, but massively popular.

Its director Lev Dodin is famed for his long version of Fyodor Dostoevsky’s The Devils, as well as Anton Chekhov’s Play Without a Name, both of which toured the world to great acclaim.

Now this local celebrity showcases her stuff at her Nevsky pr boutique, where you’ll find her striking monochromatic prêt-à-porter designs as well as her famous scarves.
Each scarf is an extraordinary work of art – one of a kind, made from silk and elaborately hand-embroidered in a painstaking process that takes three to four months (with prices from R179,000). Less expensive in-store items include shoes, pillowcases and duvet covers.

On the ground floor you'll find gifts, clothes, bikes and electronics, while the 5th floor is a huge exhibition space and restaurant.

2SPORTS & ACTIVITIES

COACHMEN'S BANYABATHHOUSE

Multilevel complex with both ordinary and lux banya as well as private rooms and saunas for you to rent with up to eight friends. The attendants are friendly and the patrons take their bathing very seriously. Last entry to all baths is 9pm.
DEGTYARNIYE BATHSBATHHOUSE
(Дегтярные Бани MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-985 1983; www.d1a.ru; Degtyarnaya ul 1a; per hr R400-750, private banya R4500-17,500; h8.30am-10pm; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
These modern baths are divided up into men’s and women’s sections, or you can book private unisex bani (hot baths) of varying degrees of luxury (these accommodate up to 14 people). Prices are cheaper before 1pm on weekdays. Minimum charge of two hours.
MYTNINSKIYE BANIBATHHOUSE
(Мытнинские бани MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mybanya.spb.ru; ul Mytninskaya 17-19; per hr R200-350; h8am-10pm Fri-Tue; mPloshchad Vosstaniya)
Unique in the city, Mytninskiye Bani is heated by a wood furnace, just like the log-cabin bathhouses that are still found in the Russian countryside. It's actually the oldest communal banya (hot bath) in the city, and in addition to a parilka (steam room) and plunge pool, the private ‘lux’ banya (R1000 to R2000 per hour) includes a swanky lounge area with leather furniture and a pool table.
KAZACHIYE BANIBATHHOUSE
(Казачьи бани GOOGLE MAP ; www.kazbani.ru; Bolshoy Kazachy per 11; per 2hr R100-300, private banya per hr R850-1700; h8am-10pm Tue-Sun; mPushkinskaya)
Following a trend that is occurring throughout the city, the communal banya is something of an afterthought here. The majority of the venue is given over to very swanky, private bani, which are an excellent option for groups of up to 10 people. The cheaper communal banya is good value though.
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday are for women; Wednesday, Friday and Sunday are for men.
KOPEJKA WORLDSCENIC DRIVE
(Копейка Мир %931-585 1021; www.kopejka-world.com; 2hr tour R6000)

Explore Vasilyevsky Island
This large, triangular island is among the oldest neighbourhoods in St Petersburg, especially the eastern tip known as the Strelka (‘tongue of land’). Crammed with classical buildings housing institutions, excellent museums such as the Kunstkamera and Menshikov Palace, and the sprawling campus of St Petersburg State University, this is the best place to start your exploration of the island.
Further back from the Strelka, Vasilyevsky Ostrov (or VO as it's commonly shortened to) is an orderly, residential place, with a grid system of wide roads lined with shops, restaurants and cafes. Make a beeline for the Russian Academy of Arts Museum, the historic St Andrew's Cathedral, the stunningly decorated Temple of the Assumption, and the compact Novy Museum showcasing late-20th-century art from the Soviet Union.
The northern and western ends of the island are rather post industrial and remote. Even so, there are things worth coming out this way to see, including the fantastic Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art, and the chance to tour around the Icebreaker Krasin and two submarines. Transport wonks will also be thrilled to find museums devoted to the city's metro and tram systems.
Local Life
ABridge Advice If you’re staying on Vasilyevsky Island, remember that in the summer months the bridges go up at night. Dvortsovy most's timetable is up at 1.10am and down for 20 minutes at 2.50am before going up again until 4.55am. Blagoveshchensky most is crossable from 2.45am until 3.10am and then not again until 5am.
ACool Street Hang with the locals on 6-ya and 7-ya liniya, the main pedestrian and commercial street of Vasilyevsky Island. Lined with cafes, bars, restaurants and shops, this is where to escape the tourist crowds at the Strelka.
ANightlife events Concerts and other events are often staged at Erarta Museum of Contemporary Art; also check out about various parties held up on the terrace of Artmuza.
Getting There & Away
AMetro The most useful metro stations are Vasileostrovskaya on Line 3 at the island’s heart and the nab Makarova/1-ya i Kadetskaya liniya exit from Sportivnaya on Line 5.
ABus The number 7 bus goes between Primorskaya to pl Vosstaniya, via Nalichnaya ul, all of Bolshoy pr and Nevsky pr. Trolleybus 10 and 11 run similar routes.
AMarshrutka From Vasileostrovskaya metro station, the following marshrutka buses zip to the far end of Sredny pr: K30, K44, K62 and K120.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
The Palace Bridge Wellness Club is one of the city's best places for a sauna and swimming. If you're travelling with children under three, drop in on a Wednesday when it's parents and under-threes only from 7am to 6.30pm. Every day, children under three pay nothing and those between three and 14 get in for half-price, but only before 6pm; after that it's adults only.

ERARTA MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART
Erarta's superb hoard of 2300 pieces of Russian contemporary art trumps its somewhat far-flung location. Housed in an ingeniously converted neoclassical Stalinist building, the museum is spread over five floors, with the main galleries focused on the permanent collection. There are also installation spaces, plenty of temporary exhibitions, occasional shows, plus a good restaurant and gift shop.

Permanent Collection
The permanent collection is an excellent survey of the past half-century of Russian art. It's particularly strong on late-Soviet underground art. One nice curatorial touch is the frequent inclusion of objects depicted in paintings – a bowl of apples will sit, for example, in front of a painting entitled Apple Picking.
Expanded Spaces
A new wing has significantly expanded the space for temporary exhibitions. One unusual feature is the inclusion of commercial galleries, where the work on display is also for sale. These tend to feature contemporary installations, paintings, video art and sculpture by Russian artists, and are worth checking out.
Immersive Installations
Consider trying out at least one of eight 'U Space Total Installations', (R200 for up to five people), small themed rooms that immerse you in worlds ranging from childhood to outer space. An extra ticket (R250) is also required for the Theatre With No Actors, a sound-and-vision show on the 2nd floor.

KUNSTKAMERA
Also known as the Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology, the Kunstkamera was the city’s first museum, founded in 1714 by Peter himself. It is famous largely for its ghoulish collection of monstrosities, preserved ‘freaks’, two-headed mutant foetuses, deformed animals and odd body parts, all collected by Peter, who had issued an edict that such malformed, stillborn infants were sent to him from across Russia.

Babies in Bottles
Peter wanted to demonstrate that malformations were not the result of the evil eye or sorcery, but rather caused by accidents of nature. This fascinating place is an essential St Petersburg sight, although not one for the faint-hearted. Think twice about bringing young children here and consider giving the Kunstkamera a wide berth if you are pregnant yourself. Indeed, where else can you see specimens with such charming names as ‘double-faced monster with brain hernia’?
Collected Curiosities
Also part of the museum's enormous collection are some wonderfully kitsch dioramas exhibiting rare objects and demonstrating cultural practices from all over the world. The 3rd floor of the museum is given over to an exhibition about polymath Mikhail Lomonosov, with a recreation of his study-laboratory.

STRELKALANDMARK
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Birzhevaya pl; mVasileostrovskaya)
This eastern tip of Vasilyevsky Island is where Peter the Great wanted his new city’s administrative and intellectual centre to be. In fact, it became the focus of the city's maritime trade, symbolised by the colonnaded Customs House (now the Institute of Russian Literature) and the Old Stock Exchange. The Strelka is flanked by the pair of Rostral Columns, archetypal St Petersburg landmarks.
The Strelka has one of the best views in the city, with the Peter and Paul Fortress to the left and the Hermitage, the Admiralty and St Isaac’s Cathedral to the right.

This compact contemporary art museum, with galleries on the 3rd and 4th floors, is worth visiting to see all kinds of visual art forms created by a group of 'non-conformist' artists working in the Soviet Union in the latter part of the 20th century. The private collection of over 500 pieces is displayed in exhibitions that change every three months or so.

A must-see if you love retro trams and trolleybuses. A handsome brick shed houses around 20 of these vehicles, both originals and replicas, that used to be more common on St Petersburg's streets. There's also a small art gallery and exhibitions of models, uniforms etc.
On Saturday and Sundays the museum also runs retro tram tours across the city to pl Turgeneva and back via the Petrograd Side; you can hop on or off the tram at any of the stops along the route.

This Whiskey-class Soviet submarine was built in 1954, and – incredibly, once you've looked around inside – served in the Soviet navy until 1990. It has been renovated, repainted and can be visited if a big cruise ship is not docked on the next door Lieutenant Schmidt Passenger Terminal.
Inside, you can see the cramped living quarters and the engine room, look through the still-working periscope and see where the torpedoes were loaded and fired.

In the midst of the university grounds is a whimsical collection of sculptures from different artists including monuments to figures as disparate as Ho Chi Minh, Vladimir Nabokov, Tomáš Masaryk and Anna Akhmatova. Look out for the one of Major Kovalyov's nose, the character from Gogol's short story The Nose. The leafy central courtyard is a pleasant place to sit, but you may need to show your passport to gain entry.
TWELVE COLLEGESUNIVERSITY
(Двенадцать коллегий MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Mendeleevskaya liniya; mVasileostrovskaya)
Completed in 1744 and marked by a statue of scientist-poet Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–65), the 400m-long Twelve Colleges is one of St Petersburg’s oldest buildings. It was originally meant for Peter’s government ministries, but is now part of the university, which stretches out behind it. Within these walls populist philosopher Nikolai Chernyshevsky studied, Alexander Popov created some of the world’s first radio waves and a young Vladimir Putin earned a degree in law.
This is also where Dmitry Mendeleev invented the periodic table of elements, and the building now contains the small Mendeleev Museum. Also of interest here is the University Sculpture Garden, which can be accessed from the main entrance.
ROSTRAL COLUMNSLANDMARK
(Ростральная колонна MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Birzhevaya pl; mVasileostrovskaya)
The two Rostral Columns, archetypal St Petersburg landmarks, are studded with ships’ prows and four seated sculptures representing four of Russia’s great rivers: the Neva, the Volga, the Dnieper and the Volkhov. These were oil-fired navigation beacons in the 1800s and their gas torches are still lit on some holidays, which makes for a breathtaking sight.

The Krasin, built in 1917, has a history almost as volatile as the 20th century itself. The Arctic icebreaker was decommissioned in 1971, and can now be visited on a guided tour that leaves every hour on the hour from 11am to 5pm. Call ahead to book a tour in English or French. Special tours of the engine room (over 14s only) are available at 1pm and 3pm on Saturday and Sunday.
The Krasin was captured by the British in 1918, returned to the Soviet Union two years later and took part in a large number of Arctic missions and rescues in her long career. The Krasin is also the last surviving ship of the infamous PQ-15 convoy that sent aid from Britain to the USSR during WWII.
MENSHIKOV PALACEMUSEUM

The first stone building in the city, the Menshikov Palace was built to the grandiose tastes of Prince Alexander Menshikov, Peter the Great’s closest friend and the first governor of St Petersburg. It is now a branch of the Hermitage, and while only a relatively small part of the palace is open to visitors, its interiors are some of the oldest and best preserved in the city.
Menshikov was of humble origins (he is said to have sold pies on the streets of Moscow as a child), but his talent for both organisation and intrigue made him the second-most important person in the Russian Empire by the time of Peter’s death in 1725. His palace, built mainly between 1710 and 1714, was the city’s smartest residence at the time (compare it to Peter the Great’s tiny Summer Palace across the river). Peter used Menshikov's palace for official functions.
The 1st floor displays some stunning Dutch tile work, intended to fortify the rooms against humidity to help ease Menshikov’s tuberculosis. Original furniture and the personal effects of Menshikov are on display and each room has a fact sheet in English explaining its history. Vavara’s Chamber is particularly evocative of how the aristocracy lived during Peter’s time, while the impressive Walnut Study also stands out.
Also of note is the magnificent Grand Hall, where balls and banquets were held, including the infamous reception for Peter's dwarf wedding, in which Peter and his court sniggered as some 70-odd dwarfs from all over Russia attended the wedding and the subsequent drunken party of Peter's favourite dwarf.

Art lovers should not bypass the museum of this time-tested institution, which contains work by academy students and faculty dating back to its foundation in 1857. Two 3500-year-old sphinxes guard the entrance of this original location of the academy, where boys would live from the age of five until they graduated at age 15. It was an experiment to create a new species of human: the artist.
For the most part, it worked; many great Russian artists were trained here, including Ilya Repin, Karl Bryullov and Anton Losenko. But the curriculum was designed with the idea that the artist must serve the state, and this conservatism led to a reaction against it. In 1863, 14 students left to found a new movement known as the Wanderers (Peredvizhniki), which went on to revolutionise Russian art.
Nonetheless, the Academy of Arts has many achievements to show off, including numerous studies, drawings and paintings by academy members. On the 3rd floor you can examine the models for the original versions of Smolny Cathedral, St Isaac’s Cathedral and the Alexander Nevsky Monastery. When you enter through the main door take the flight of stairs on your left up to the 2nd floor, where you can buy tickets.

This stunning 1895 neo-Byzantine church was built by architect Vasily Kosyakov on the site of a former monastery. It was closed during the Soviet period, and in 1957 the building became the city’s first – and very popular – year-round skating rink. The 7.7m, 861kg metal cross on the roof was only replaced in 1998. Following a wonderful renovation, the church is looking superb again; do go inside to see the murals and icons covering the interior.
The church runs a small, pleasant cafe (open 11am to 9pm) next door.

One of the biggest and best of its kind in the world, the Museum of Zoology was founded in 1832 and has some amazing exhibits, including a vast blue whale skeleton that greets you in the first hall. The highlight is unquestionably the stuffed skin of a 44,000-year-old woolly mammoth thawed out of the Siberian ice in 1902. There are also skeletons of a further three mammoths, including two baby ones – all incredible finds.

Currently closed, the plan is for this to become a branch of the Hermitage to house the museum's heraldry collection.

For decades the Kuryokhin Centre, a hub for the contemporary arts, was based in a clapped-out but atmospheric old cinema here. At the time of research a new, excitingly designed home was being constructed with the plan to open later in 2019 when the famous SKIF festival will again be held here.
Catch bus 6 or 7, or trolleybus 10 or 11 from opp side of road.
METRO MUSEUMMUSEUM

Bring your passport with you to access this small but interesting museum, which recounts the history of St Petersburg's metro. Sadly there's no signage in English, so this is strictly for enthusiasts, but there are nice touches, such as a metro escalator taking you between floors and a metro car and cab you can enter to 'drive' your own train.
ST ANDREW'S CATHEDRALCATHEDRAL
(Андреевский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-323 3418; http://andrew-sobor.ru/; 6-ya liniya 11; mVasileostrovskaya)
Completed in 1786, this Baroque-style cathedral is a handsome feature of Vasilyevsky Island's skyline. The interior decoration is restrained compared to similar Russian Orthodox cathedrals.
GEOLOGICAL MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Геологический музей MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-328 9248; www.vsegei.ru; Sredny pr 74; h10am-4pm Mon-Fri; mVasileostrovskaya)F
Located in the upper floors of the All-Russian Geological Science and Research Institute, this huge and lovingly maintained museum contains thousands of fossils, rocks and gems. Highlights include a huge map of the Soviet Union made entirely of precious gems, which won the Paris World Exposition Grand Prix in 1937, and the giant skeleton of a mandschurosaurus.
On entering the building, call 7446 on the house phone and say you’d like to visit the museum (ya hachoo pasyeteet moozáy) and someone will escort you.
MENDELEEV MUSEUMMUSEUM

Call ahead to arrange a tour of this small but interesting museum inside St Petersburg University and dedicated to Dmitry Mendeleev, creator of the periodic table of elements in 1869. His study has been lovingly preserved and you can see his desk (where he always stood rather than sat) and early drafts of the periodic table.
Entry is via the main gate on Mendeleevskaya liniya.
PUSHKIN HOUSEMUSEUM

The old Customs House, topped with statues and a dome, is now home to the Institute of Russian Literature. Fondly called Pushkin House, the handsome building contains a small literary museum with dusty exhibits on Tolstoy, Gogol, Lermontov and Turgenev, as well as a room dedicated to the writers of the Silver Age. Call in advance for an English-language tour.
PEOPLE’S WILL D-2 SUBMARINE MUSEUMMUSEUM

The People’s Will (Narodovolets) D-2 Submarine was one of the first six diesel-fuelled submarines built in the Soviet Union and has been wonderfully preserved in this purpose-built museum. The sub itself saw action between 1931 and 1956, and sank five German ships during WWII. Today you can wander around its supremely well-preserved (yet totally antiquated) interior and look at its equipment and weaponry. There's also a small museum containing photos, models and paintings of other submarines, including the ill-fated Kursk.

This chain of cafeteria-style restaurants has a popular outlet on Vasilyevsky Island's main commercial strip. With appealing, light-bathed dining areas, a large choice of excellent-value salads, soups, meat dishes and desserts, and with friendly service to boot, this spotless place is a lifeline for anyone after a low-cost lunch. There's also a cafe downstairs.

Specialising in Adzhika cuisine from the Caucasus, this stylish place offers 10 types of khachapuri, the cheesy dough pies that are a bit like a thick-crust pizza. You can also sample khinkali (dumplings), Georgian wines and all-day breakfast dishes such as spicy scrambled eggs.

(Кардамон MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %8-911-753 4741; 1-ya liniya 18; mains R250-650; hnoon-11pm; Wv; mVasileostrovskaya)
The lacklustre decor may not instantly endear this Indian-run place to you, but its popularity with locals and visiting Indians says a great deal. The English-speaking owner will make you feel very welcome and the selection of delicious baltis, vindaloos, kadhai, biryanis and vegetarian dishes is impressive.
STOLLERUSSIAN$
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.stolle.ru; 1-ya liniya 50; pies from R90; h8am-10pm; mVasileostrovskaya)
This cosy pie shop and cafe was the first in this now nationwide chain. Aptly enough for a cafe that sells Saxon-style pies, it’s located in the heart of St Petersburg’s old German neighbourhood.

Shabby chic has never looked so good as it does at this cafe-bar dedicated to the poet Joseph Brodsky (the name is a pun on buterbrod, the Russian word for sandwich), a super-stylish addition to Vasilyevsky Island's eating and drinking scene. The menu runs from excellent smørrebrød (open sandwiches; from R260) to various set meals of salads and soup.
It's also a great place for a drink as they specialise in home-made fruit-flavoured spirits and have their own very refreshing beer. The decor is particularly cool: Brodsky's (literally) chiselled features stare down on you from where they've been hammered into the cracked old walls, while elements of the historic building have been preserved and gorgeously integrated into the design.
PRYANOSTI & RADOSTICAUCASIAN$$

If you're travelling with young children they will love this branch of the Ginza Project–run chain for its colourful, fun design that includes a children's room in the shape of a galleon, parrots in wall niches, an outdoor playground in summer and a real-life menagerie of animals, including a racoon, Clarissa the goat and two rabbits.
Pryanosti & Radosti (Spice and Joy) is around the back of the building, with Moko Burger (run by the same company and serving burgers, Georgian street food and craft beer) facing the street.

To fully take in the contemporary art collection at Erarta will take several hours, so it's handy that the museum's restaurant is a pretty good one that's worth building into your itinerary. The menu is fairly adventurous and includes well-made soups, light dishes such as barley risotto or hand-made truffle pasta, and desserts inspired by works of art.
The restaurant is also open on a Tuesday when the museum is closed.
From Vasileostrovskaya metro station, catch bus 6 or 7 to the museum, or trolleybus 10 or 11 from the opposite side of the road.

Despite the laughable wax figure of a barely recognisable Pushkin with a quill in his hand at the entrance, ‘Peter’s City’ is a classy German restaurant and microbrewery with an impressive menu and cosy decor. There’s a separate bar where you can drink home-brewed lager, Weizen and Dunkel beers, while the menu is all about meat, and particularly sausages.
See if you can manage the metre-long Thüringer, served with onion sauce and red cabbage. Ask also for a free tour of the on-site microbrewery. There's live music Friday and Saturday from 8pm. In summer the outdoor tables offer amazing views of St Isaac’s Cathedral and the Admiralty across the Neva River.

(Сакартвело MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-328 0772; 12-ya liniya 13; mains R220-800; h11am-11pm; W; mVasileostrovskaya)
Although not flash, this is one of Vasilyevsky Island’s best Georgian restaurants – a friendly place on a residential backstreet, where sumptuous Caucasian feasts are served up at any time of day, backed up by live music most evenings from 7pm.

(Ресторанъ MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-323 3031; Tamozhenny per 2; mains R700-2600; hnoon-11pm; W; mAdmiralteyskaya)
Nearly 20 years on the scene and this excellent place is still going strong. Stylish and airily bright, Restoran is somehow formal and relaxed at the same time. The menu combines the best of haute Russe cuisine with enough modern flair to keep things interesting: try duck baked with apples or whole baked sterlet (a species of sturgeon) in white wine and herbs.
In the winter fires roar, while in the summer the thick stone walls make for an oasis from the heat. Do not miss the superb Napoleon dessert, or the interesting selection of quality Russian wines.

At this upmarket steakhouse you're guaranteed a wide selection of various cuts of prime beef as well as other meats. Or you could keep it lighter with a burger, Greek-style gyros sandwich or (heaven forbid!) a salad. Its stylish, brick-walled subterranean location is a plus.

Vasilyevsky Island

START STRELKA (ADMIRALTEYSKAYA)
END 6-YA LINIYA I 7-YA LINIYA (VASILEOSTROVSKAYA)
LENGTH 2KM; TWO HOURS
The eastern nose of Vasilyevsky Island, the 1Strelka, boasts an unparalleled panorama, looking out over the Peter and Paul Fortress, the Hermitage, the Admiralty and St Isaac’s Cathedral. The red 2Rostral Columns frame the view; climb the steps of the 3Old Stock Exchange for a raised perspective.
Continue southwest, dropping into either the 4Museum of Zoology or the 5Kunstkamera, or both. The latter was Russia’s first museum, set up by Peter to dispel common superstitions about illness and disease and includes an infamous collection of deformed foetuses preserved in bottles.
At Peter’s behest, Domenico Trezzini built the magnificent 6Twelve Colleges, now St Petersburg State University, in 1722. The emperor based his bureaucracy here; separate entrances for each ministry signified their independence, while the unified facade highlighted collective goals. Now part of the university, you'll find here the small 7Mendeleev Museum, the beautiful university botanical gardens and a quirky collection of sculptures.
Peter originally gifted the entirety of Vasilyevsky Island to his best friend, Prince Menshikov, who proceeded to build the fabulous 8Menshikov Palace on the north bank of the Bolshaya Neva. Menshikov’s humble origins gave him a taste for opulence, and the interior is the best-preserved Petrine decor in the city.
Two Egyptian sphinx monuments mark the entrance to the institutional 9Academy of Arts Museum, which houses 250 years’ worth of artistic expression. On display are works created by academy students and faculty over the years, as well as temporary exhibitions. A beautiful old library – lined with dusty volumes and packed with dark wood furniture – is open for visiting researchers.
Head inland up 6-ya liniya i 7-ya liniya where you can pop briefly into the aPharmacy Museum of Dr Pelya to view the original 19th-century interior. Across Bolshoy pr, the street is pedestrianised and tree-lined, with the charming bSt Andrew's Cathedral on the corner.

If the idea of going to a 'Belgian gastronomic pub' makes your eyes roll, you're in good company, but this pleasant basement space overcomes its heavy-handed marketing with cosy leather booths, a comfortable bar to sit at and more than 20 Belgian beers on tap. There's also a great menu (in English, if required), including fresh White Sea mussels and meaty mains.

This is one of the city's largest 'creative clusters' with around 13,000 sq metres of space over several floors hosting a variety of art galleries, studios, fashion boutiques and designers. On the ground floor look out for the joint atelier of Snega Gallery and Slavutnitsa where designers specialise in making clothes and accessories based on traditional Russian costumes and patterns.

Explore Petrograd & Vyborg Sides
Peter’s city was first founded on the Petrograd Side and it's a fascinating place packed with historical sites, stunning Style Moderne architecture and a couple of great live music venues. The showstopper of the area is the Peter & Paul Fortress, whose museums, soaring cathedral and panoramic views easily warrant a half- or a full-day visit. Afterwards, you could easily spend a few days taking in fascinating sights that see far fewer visitors such as the treasure-filled Hermitage Storage Facility, the sprawling Museum of Political History and insightful house museums devoted to the likes of early 20th-century opera singer Chaliapin and Soviet party boss (and Stalinist victim) Kirov.
Aside from hitting the main sights, the Petrograd Side is a fine area for exploring. The main thoroughfare of Bolshoy pr is dotted with shops, restaurants and cafes, and you’ll find intriguing architecture scattered throughout the district. This area is also a fine destination when you need a break from the urban bustle. The wooded islands found here make a great retreat from the city streets, particularly Yelagin where you can hire boats and bicycles, and Krestovsky with its tree-lined lanes and sizeable amusement park.
Local Life
AParks If the weather’s good, join the locals as they take to the Kirovsky Islands for fairground rides, boating, sunbathing and cycling through the woods – it’s a total escape from the city, just three metro stops from the centre.
AStreet Art Check out the creative daubs of street artists on the walls around the shuttered Red Banner Textile Factory and the giant murals near Chkalovskaya metro.
AStrip off Stand next to the serious sunbathers tanning against the fortress walls or on the beach at Zayachy Island. For a year-round tropical holiday, splash around with crowds at Piterland water park.
Getting There & Away
AMetro The Petrograd Side is served by Gorkovskaya and Petrogradskaya on Line 2, and by Sportivnaya, Chkalovskaya and Krestovsky Ostrov on Line 5. The Vyborg Side has some 20 metro stations on it, mainly serving far-flung residential areas.
ABus Bus 10 runs from the Vyborg Side at Chyornaya Rechka, down Bolshoy pr on the Petrograd Side and on into the Historic Heart.
ATram Tram 6 provides a handy link between pl Lenina and Vasilyevsky Island via Kronverksky pr on the Petrograd Side, while tram 40 is also useful for traversing the Petrograd Side to Chyornaya Rechka.
AMarshrutka Marshrutka 346 runs the length of Bolshoy pr and then turns left onto Kamennoostrovsky pr and on to the Vyborg Side.
Lonely Planet's Top Tip
This is the real St Petersburg – a far cry from the uniform beauty of the Historic Heart. The Petrograd Side is a good place to see the everyday life of the middle classes in the city and, while the Vyborg Side around pl Lenina is a vision of a post-industrial nightmare, your average Joes live in the Soviet housing estates further along the metro line – travel to the end of lines 1 or 2 and you’ll see real city life.

TOP SIGHT
PETER & PAUL FORTRESS
Housing a cathedral, a former prison and various exhibitions, this large defensive fortress on Zayachy Island is the kernel from which St Petersburg grew into the city it is today. History buffs should definitely schedule a visit here. There are also panoramic views from atop the fortress walls, at the foot of which lies a sandy riverside beach, a prime spot for sunbathing.

The Fortress
Having captured this formerly Swedish settlement on the Neva, Peter set to turn the outpost into a modern Western city, starting with the Peter & Paul Fortress in 1703. It has never been utilised in the city’s defence – unless you count incarceration of political ‘criminals’ as national defence.
Today, the fort makes for a fascinating half-day outing. The main entrance is across the Ioannovsky Bridge at the island's northeast end; there's also access via the Kronwerk Bridge, which is within walking distance of Sportivnaya metro station.
SS Peter & Paul Cathedral
All of Russia's pre-revolutionary rulers from Peter the Great onwards (except Peter II and Ivan VI) are buried inside this cathedral ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R450/250; h10am-7pm Mon, Tue & Thu-Sat, 11am-7pm Sun; mGorkovskaya), which has a magnificent baroque interior quite different from other Orthodox churches. Peter I’s grave is at the front on the right of the iconostasis. In 1998, the remains of Nicholas II and his family – minus Alexey and Maria – were interred in the Chapel of St Catherine, to the right of the entrance.
The 122.5m-high bell tower ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Ostrov; adult/child R150/90; h11am-5.30pm May-Sep; mGorkovskaya) is the city's second-tallest structure after the television tower. At the base there is a small exhibition about the renovation of the tower in 1997, as well as an up-close inspection of the bell-ringing mechanism. The main reason to climb all these steps, of course, is for the magnificent 360-degree panorama. To ascend, you'll have to join a guided tour (in Russian only), which take place several times a day.
The Trubetskoy Bastion
Evocative use of the original cells for displays about the former political prisoners of Trubetskoy Bastion ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R200/120; h10am-7pm Thu-Mon, to 6pm Tue; mGorkovskaya) – who included the likes of Maxim Gorky, Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Bakunin and Fyodor Dostoevsky – make this the best of the fort's clutch of exhibitions. Short biographies in English of the various inmates are posted on the doors.
Peter the Great's son was tortured to death here and, after the 1917 revolution, the communists continued to use the prison for former aristocrats and counter-revolutionaries until 1924, when it was turned into a museum.
The Commandant’s House & Neva Gate
The fascinating museum in the Commandant's House ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.spbmuseum.ru; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R200/120; h11am-6pm Mon & Thu-Sun, to 5pm Tue; mGorkovksaya) charts the history of the St Petersburg region from medieval times to 1918. What starts as a fairly standard-issue plod through the city’s history really comes alive once you’re upstairs, with modern, interactive exhibits, even though there’s still a lack of explanations in English.
In the south wall is the Neva Gate, a later addition (1787), where prisoners were loaded on boats for execution or exile. Notice the plaques here showing water levels of famous (and obviously devastating) floods. Outside there are fine views of the whole central waterfront, including the Hermitage.
Along the wall, to the left, is the territory of the Walrus Club, the crazy crew that chops a hole in the iced-over Neva each winter so they can take a dip. Swimmers, known as morzhi (walruses), claim the practice eliminates muscle pains, boosts energy and even improves libido. This is not an exclusive club – all are invited to take the plunge!

PETER THE GREAT STATUE

Between the cathedral and the Senior Officers’ Barracks is Mikhail Shemyakin’s Peter the Great statue, which depicts him seated with strangely proportioned head and hands. When the statue was unveiled in 1991 it caused outrage among the city's citizens, for whom Peter remains a saintly figure. Local lore has it that rubbing his right forefinger will bring good luck.
Within the fortress grounds, you can grab a snack at the stolovaya (cafeteria) Leningradskoye Kafe ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; mains R240-360; h10am-8pm Thu-Tue; mGorkovskaya).
A far nicer option is Koryushka, at the southwestern end of Zayachy Island.
POSTERN & NEVA PANORAMA

A separate ticket gains you access to both the Postern, a 97.4m passage hidden in the fortress walls, and the Neva Panorama ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Peter & Paul Fortress, Zayachy Island; adult/student R300/270; h10am-8pm Thu-Tue; mGorkovskaya), a walkway atop the walls, which concludes at Naryshkin Bastion. Every day at noon a cannon is fired from here, a tradition dating back to Peter the Great's times.

The elegant Style Moderne Kshesinskaya Palace (1904) is a highly appropriate location for this excellent museum – one of the city's best – covering Russian politics in scrupulous detail up to contemporary times.
The palace, previously the home of Mathilda Kshesinskaya, famous ballet dancer and one-time lover of Nicholas II in his pre-tsar days, was briefly the headquarters of the Bolsheviks, and Lenin often gave speeches from the balcony.
You could spend hours exploring this museum (indeed there are two separate audio guides for the sprawling collection). Don't miss the portrait of Nicholas II, which shows the bayonet cuts made by soldiers during his night of capture on 26 October 1917. Photos show some of the horrors of the Soviet days, including 1933 street scenes in Ukraine, with the streets sprinkled with those who had died of starvation – owing to Stalin's policies. The Lenin memorial room is unchanged since Soviet days, with an almost religious atmosphere. You can visit Lenin’s one-time office where he worked between the February and October Revolutions.
LEUCHTENBERG HOUSENOTABLE BUILDING
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshaya Zelenina ul 28; mChkalovskaya)
The Style Moderne gem Leuchtenberg House is so called because it once belonged to the Duke of Leuchtenberg, great-grandson of Tsar Nicholas I. Cross the street to take in the full glory of the mosaic frieze spread across the upper storey of the facade, the key decorative feature of the architect Theodor von Postels.
ROSENSHTEIN APARTMENT BUILDINGHISTORIC BUILDING
(Tower House; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Kamennoostrovsky pr 35; mPetrogradskaya)
Petrogradsky Island is packed with architectural treasures, including this building, which plays with medieval themes in its stuccoed walls, lancet windows and twin castle-like towers looming over the street.
KIROV MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей Кирова MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.kirovmuseum.ru; Kamennoostrovsky pr 26/28; adult/child R150/100; h11am-6pm Thu-Tue; mPetrogradskaya)
Leningrad party boss Sergei Kirov was one of the most powerful men in Russia in the early 1930s. His decidedly un-proletarian apartment is now a fascinating museum showing how the Bolshevik elite really lived: take a quick journey back to the days of Soviet glory, including choice examples of 1920s technology, such as the first-ever Soviet-produced typewriter and a conspicuously noncommunist GE fridge, complete with plastic food inside.
Many of Kirov’s personal items are on display and his office from the Smolny Institute has been fully reconstructed in one of the rooms. Kirov lived for 10 years at this flat until his murder at Stalin’s behest in 1934, which sparked a wave of deadly repression in the country.
The floor above the Kirov collection has a recreated school room and shows what life was like for children in the 1930s. The 'boy's room' contains actual childhood objects belonging to Eugeny Porsin (including a cheery watercolour he painted), who was born in 1925, and was later drafted to serve in WWII. He died from wounds sustained near Vienna just 10 days before the end of fighting.
PETER’S CABINHISTORIC BUILDING
(Домик Петра Великого MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Petrovskaya nab 6; adult/student R200/100; h10am-6pm Wed & Fri-Mon, 1-9pm Thu; mGorkovskaya)
This charming log cottage, protected within a stone building, is St Petersburg’s oldest surviving structure. The wooden cabin itself was supposedly built in three days in May 1703 for Peter to live in while he supervised the construction of the fortress and city.
Feeling more like a shrine than a museum, the cabin confirms Peter’s love for the simple life with its unpretentious, homely feel, visibly influenced by the time he spent in Holland.
It has long been a sentimental site for St Petersburg. During WWII, Soviet soldiers would take an oath of allegiance to the city here, vowing to protect it from the Germans, before disappearing to the front. After the Siege of Leningrad, this was the first museum to reopen to the public.
Look out for the bronze bust of Peter by Parmen Zabello in the garden.
ALEXANDROVSKY PARKPARK
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; c; mGorkovskaya)
This leafy park, laid out in 1845, wraps in an arc around the Kronwerk moat and Artillery Museum. It's too close to traffic to ensure a peaceful escape but, if you have kids in tow, it harbours a few attractions worth considering, the best of which is the Planetarium, offering shows throughout the day, an observatory and several different display halls.
Also inside the park is Mini St Petersburg – miniature sculptures of the city's key landmarks that make for a fun photo opportunity.
CHALIAPIN HOUSE MUSEUMMUSEUM

Opera buffs will want to visit this house–museum where the great singer Fyodor Chaliapin (1873–1938) lived before fleeing the Soviet Union in 1922. The kindly babushkas (clearly music lovers) will happily play some of the singer’s recordings for you as you peruse his personal effects. Check online for details of concerts held here.

Also known as the House of Matyushin, this small museum occupies a charming grey-painted wooden cottage dating from the mid-19th century that was once the home of avant-garde artist Mikhail Matyushin (1861–1934). The exhibition here relates to Matyushin’s work and that of his coterie. Entrance is free on Fridays.
BOTANICAL GARDENSGARDENS
(Ботанический сад MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-372 5464; http://botsad-spb.com; ul Professora Popova 2; adult/child R300/200; hgrounds 10am-8pm Tue-Sun May-Sep; greenhouse 11am-4.30pm Tue-Sun year-round; mPetrogradskaya)
On eastern Aptekarsky (Apothecary) Island, this was once a garden of medicinal plants – founded by Peter the Great himself in 1714 – that gave the island its name. Today the botanical gardens contain 26 greenhouses on a 22-hectare site. It is a lovely place to stroll around, and a fascinating place to visit – and not just for botanists.
At the turn of the 20th century, these were the second-biggest botanical gardens in the world, behind London’s Kew Gardens. However, 90% of the plants died during WWII, which makes the present collection all the more impressive (you will recognise the ‘veterans’ by their war medals).
A highlight is the tsaritsa nochi (Selenicereus pteranthus), a flowering cactus that blossoms only one night a year, usually in mid-June. On this night, the gardens stay open until morning for visitors to gawk at the marvel and sip champagne.
Entry to the gardens is on the corner of Aptekarsky per and nab reki Karpovki. Although the grounds close from October to April, the greenhouses are open all year, with visits by guided tour (in Russian) only.
YELIZAROV MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей-квартира Елизаровых MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-235 3778; ul Lenina 52, flat 24; adult/student R250/120; h10am-6pm Thu-Sun, 1-9pm Wed; mChkalovskaya)
Lenin’s wife’s family lived in this apartment-turned-museum and VIadimir Ilyich himself laid low here before the revolution while organising the workers. The delightful turn-of-the-20th-century fittings have been preserved intact, including a telephone that still bears Lenin’s home phone number. By the look of things, Lenin had a very bourgeois time of it.
The apartment building, which is known locally as the ‘boat house’ due to its external similarities to a large cruise liner, was built in 1913 at the height of St Petersburg’s lust for Style Moderne. After finding the entrance, head up the stairs to the 3rd floor to be buzzed in.
CRUISER AURORAMUSEUM
(Крейсер Аврора MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-230 8440; www.aurora.org.ru; Petrovskaya nab; adult/child R600/400; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun; c; mGorkovskaya)
Moored on the Bolshaya Nevka, the Aurora had a walk-on part in the communist revolution. On the night of 25 October 1917, its crew fired a blank round from the forward gun as a signal for the start of the assault on the Winter Palace. Restored and painted in pretty colours, it’s a living museum that swarms with kids on weekends.
Launched in 1901, the Aurora saw action in the Russo-Japanese War and was sunk by German bombs in WWII. Inside you can view the crew's quarters as well as communist propaganda and a collection of friendship banners from around the world.
MOSQUEMOSQUE
(Соборная мечеть MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %821-233 9819; http://dum-spb.ru/kontakty; Kronverksky pr 7; h7am-9pm; mGorkovskaya)
This beautiful working mosque (built 1910–14) was modelled on Samarkand’s Gur-e Amir Mausoleum. Its fluted azure dome and minarets are stunning and surprisingly prominent in the city’s skyline. Outside of prayer times, if you are respectfully dressed (women should wear a head covering, men long trousers), you can walk through the gate at the northeast side and ask the guard for entry – the interior is equally lovely.
If you are allowed in, remove your shoes, do not talk and do not take photos.
ARTILLERY MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей Артиллерии MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-232 0296; www.artillery-museum.ru; Kroneverskaya nab; adult/student R400/250; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun; c; mGorkovskaya)
Housed in the fort’s original arsenal, across the moat from the Peter & Paul Fortress, this fire-powered museum chronicles Russia’s military history, with examples of weapons dating all the way back to the Stone Age. The centrepiece is Lenin’s armoured car, which he rode in triumph from the Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal).
Even if you are not impressed by guns and bombs, who can resist climbing around on the tanks and trucks that adorn the courtyard?
CHAEV MANSIONARCHITECTURE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; ul Rentgena 9; h8am-2pm & 3-9pm Mon-Fri, 9am-2pm Sat; mPetrogradskaya)
This elegant mansion, constructed in 1907 for the engineer SN Chaev, is now occupied by a public clinic. It combines neoclassical and art nouveau motifs and has a beautifully preserved interior.
RED BANNER TEXTILE FACTORYNOTABLE BUILDING
(Трикотажная фабрика «Красное Знамя» MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Pionerskaya ul 53; mChkalovskaya)F
The Red Banner Textile Factory is a grand relic of Soviet constructivist architecture. Street artists have commandeered walls around the abandoned industrial space to create an outdoor gallery of technicolour images, mainly along Korpusnaya ul.

(Музей хлеба MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://muzei-xleb.ru; ul Mikhailova 2; adult/student R150/100; h10am-6pm Tue-Sat; mPloshchad Lenina)
This quirky little museum pays tribute to bread and the role it has played in history (of the city and of the world). A model bakery exhibits the equipment that was used to make bread for the city’s poorest classes in the 19th century. A special exhibition on the Siege of Leningrad offers a chilling example of a daily ration of bread during WWII, as well as rare photographs of starving children and bread queues.
The museum's new location is a short stroll from Pl Lenina.
TOY MUSEUMMUSEUM
(Музей игрушки MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab reki Karpovki 32; adult/child R300/100; h11am-6pm Tue-Sun; mPetrogradskaya)
This privately run museum presents its pan-Russian collection in three sections – folk toys, factory toys and artisanal toys. Examples of the last include toys made in Sergiev Posad, home of the ubiquitous matryoshka (nesting doll), a creation often assumed to be far older than it is, being created for the first time only in the 19th century.
At the time of research, the museum was closed for renovations.

This odd conceptual exhibition, based on abstractions and ideas, not artefacts, is an outgrowth of the Psychoanalytic Institute that houses it. The two-room exhibition aims to stimulate your subconscious as you struggle to read the display symbolising what Freud himself would have dreamt. Illustrations of Freud’s patients’ dreams and quotations line the dimly lit, incense-scented hall. English is spoken.

Architectural Tour of Petrograd Side

START PETER & PAUL FORTRESS (GORKOVSKAYA)
END ROSENSHTEIN APARTMENT BUILDING (PETROGRADSKAYA)
LENGTH 1.5KM; TWO HOURS
The Petrograd Side is an architectural treasure trove with buildings ranging from the time of St Petersburg's very inception up to contemporary times. Start with a quick tour of the city’s first defensive installation, the 1Peter & Paul Fortress. Don't miss the splendid 2SS Peter & Paul Cathedral, the last resting place of Peter the Great and almost every tsar since.
The central square of Peter’s early city, 3Troitskaya pl (Trinity Sq) formerly had as its centrepiece Trinity Cathedral, where Peter attended Mass. The cathedral was destroyed soon after the 1917 revolution but a small chapel remains on the spot.
Petrovskaya nab is home to two historic landmarks: 4Peter’s Cabin, the wooden hut that was the tsar's first modest home in the city; and, off the island’s eastern tip, the 5Cruiser Aurora, a legendary battleship which saw service in the Russo‑Japanese War.
Return to Kamennoostrovsky pr via ul Kuybysheva, passing the lovely Style Moderne palace of ballerina Mathilda Kshesinskaya that now houses the 6Museum of Political History, and the 7Mosque, coated in dazzling mosaics of aquatint tiles.
Continue north along Kamennoostrovsky pr to get a sense of Petrograd’s ever-growing vibrancy. Look closely for architectural gems around 8Avstriyskaya pl, with its castlelike edifices. Further along, if you want to get an idea of what one of these grand Style Moderne apartment blocks looks like inside, visit the 9Kirov Museum.
Ul Rentgena offers up more Style Moderne beauties: note the decoration on the facade of No 4 and make sure you do a full circle of the freestanding aChaev Mansion, which exhibits great geometric precision in its design.
Follow ul Lva Tolstogo towards the metro and you'll pass the whimsical, turretted bRosenshtein Apartment Building (also know as the Tower House). Designed by Andrey Belogrud, this mash-up of neoclassical and neo-Gothic styles now houses a theatre.
1Kirovsky Islands
This is the collective name for the three outer delta islands of the Petrograd Side – Kamenny, Yelagin and Krestovsky. Once marshy forests, the islands were granted to 18th- and 19th-century court favourites and developed into elegant playgrounds. Still mostly parkland, they are leafy venues for picnics, river sports and White Nights’ cavorting, as well as home to St Petersburg’s super rich.
The metro station Krestovsky Ostrov provides easy access to both Krestovsky and Yelagin Islands; for Kamenny you can walk across the bridge from metro station Chyornaya Rechka on the Vyborg Side.
Yelagin Island
This island is one giant park, free of traffic and a serene place to wander. It was attractively landscaped by the architect Carlo Rossi and its centrepiece, also by Rossi, is the beautifully restored Yelagin Palace ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; http://elaginpark.org; Yelagin ostrov 1; h10am-6pm; mKrestovsky Ostrov), which Alexander I commissioned for his mother, Empress Maria. The gorgeous interiors, with detailed murals and incredible inlaid-wood floors, are furnished with antiques. Unfortunately, the palace remains closed for long-term renovations.
Other nearby estate buildings host temporary exhibitions, too. The rest of the island is a lovely network of paths, greenery, lakes and channels. At the northern end of the island, you can rent row boats to explore the ponds or in-line skates to explore the paths; in winter it’s an ideal setting for sledding, skiing and skating. At the west end, a plaza looks out to the Gulf of Finland: sunsets are resplendent from here.
KAMENNY ISLANDISLAND
(Каменный остров MAP GOOGLE MAP ; mChyornaya Rechka)
Century-old dacha (country cottages) and mansions, inhabited by very wealthy locals, line the wooded lanes that twist their way around Kamenny (Stone) Island. The island is punctuated by a series of canals, lakes and ponds, and is pleasant for strolling at any time of year. At its east end, the Church of St John the Baptist (built 1776–81) has been charmingly restored.
Behind it, Catherine the Great built the big, classical Kamennoostrovsky Palace ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) for her son; unfortunately it's visible only from the outside.
For years a dead oak, supposedly planted by Peter the Great, stood in the middle of the Krestovka embankment. The old oak has been removed and replaced with a young, healthy tree, but it is still known as Peter’s Tree.
CHURCH OF ST JOHN THE BAPTISTCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Kamennoostrovsky pr; h9am-6pm)
An elegant red-brick church built in the 18th century.
PETER'S TREELANDMARK
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
According to legend Kamenny Island was the site where Peter the Great planted an oak tree, which stood proudly over many years. The old oak, however, died and has since been replaced with a young, healthy tree; nevertheless, it is still known as Peter’s Tree.
KRESTOVSKY ISLANDISLAND
(Крестовский остров GOOGLE MAP ; c; mKrestovsky Ostrov)
The biggest of the three northern islands, Krestovsky consists mostly of the vast Maritime Victory Park, dotted with sports fields; at the far western end is the massive, 68,000-seat Krestovsky Stadium, which will play a pivotal role in the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
At the main entrance opposite the metro station you can rent bikes and in-line skates. Also here is Divo Ostrov, a Disney-style amusement park with exciting fairground rides that kids will adore.
MARITIME VICTORY PARKPARK

TOP SIGHT
HERMITAGE STORAGE FACILITY
Guided tours of the Hermitage’s state-of-the-art restoration and storage facility are highly recommended. This is not a formal exhibition as such, but the guides are knowledgeable and the examples chosen for display (paintings, furniture and carriages) are wonderful.
The storage facility is directly behind the big shopping centre opposite the metro station – look for the enormous golden-yellow glass facility decorated with shapes inspired by petroglyphs.
The highlight is undoubtedly the gorgeous 17-part ceremonial tent presented to Alexander III by the Emir of Bukhara in 1893. Other treasures include an embroidered Turkish tent, presented to Catherine the Great by the Sultan Selim III one century earlier. Beside it stands an equally impressive modern diplomatic gift: a massive woodcarving of the mythical garuda bird, given by Indonesia to the city for its 300th anniversary. Another section contains gorgeous pieces from the imperial wardrobe, including the wedding gown worn by Alexandra Feodorovna (Nicholas II's wife) and dresses worn by their daughters Tatiana and Olga, Russia's last tsarinas.
Other notable displays are of ancient Russian icons and frescoes; selections from the collection of 3500 canvases by Russian artists down the ages; a hall of imperial carriages; and a depository stacked with all kinds of furniture – a veritable imperial IKEA!
Call ahead to reserve a tour in English.

SAMPSONIEVSKY CATHEDRALCATHEDRAL
(Сампсониевский собор MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Bolshoy Sampsonievsky pr 41; h9am-6pm; mVyborgskaya)
This light-blue baroque cathedral dates from 1740, and having been repainted and restored to its original glory both inside and out, glistens like a pearl amid a gritty industrial area. Its most interesting feature is the calendar of saints, two enormous panels on either side of the nave, each representing six months of the year, where every day is decorated with a mini-icon of its saint(s).
The enormous silver chandelier above the altar is also something to behold, as is the stunning baroque, green-and-golden iconostasis. Don’t miss the frieze of a young Peter the Great, on the wall behind you when you face the main iconostasis.
This is also believed to be the church where Catherine the Great married her one-eyed lover Grigory Potemkin in a secret ceremony in 1774.
BUDDHIST TEMPLETEMPLE
(Буддистский Храм MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %981-755 9605; www.dazan.spb.ru; Primorsky pr 91; h10am-6pm Mon-Fri, to 7pm Sat & Sun; mStaraya Derevnya)
Another in the city's collection of grand religious buildings is this beautiful functioning datsan (temple) where respectful visitors are welcome. The main prayer hall has lovely mosaic decoration and there's a cheap and cheerful cafe in the basement. The temple was built between 1909 and 1915 at the instigation of Pyotr Badmaev, a Buddhist physician to Tsar Nicholas II.
Money was raised from all over Russia, and as far afield as Thailand and England, by various Buddhist organisations; it even gained the support of the Dalai Lama in Lhasa.
In the 1930s the communists shut the temple, arrested many of the monks and used the building as a military radio station. In the 1960s it was taken over by the Zoological Institute and used as laboratories. Thankfully, however, the damage was not particularly profound and the datsan was returned to the city’s small Buddhist community in 1990.
PISKARYOVSKOE CEMETERYCEMETERY
(Пискарёвское мемориальное кладбище GOOGLE MAP ; www.pmemorial.ru; pr Nepokoryonnikh 72; h9am-9pm May-Oct, to 6pm Nov-Apr; mPloshchad Muzhestva)
The main burial place for the victims of the Nazi blockade in WWII is a stark and poignant memorial to the tragedy. Some half a million people were laid to rest here between 1941 and 1943, during the siege.
From metro station Ploshchad Muzhestva, take marshrutka 123 in the direction of Ladozhskaya metro, which passes by the entrance to the cemetery.
Originally, this area was just an enormous pit where unnamed and unmarked bodies were dumped. In 1960 the remodelled cemetery was opened and has been an integral part of the city’s soul ever since. Every year on Victory Day (9 May) the cemetery is packed out with mourners, many of whom survived the blockade or lost close relatives to starvation.
FINLAND STATIONHISTORIC BUILDING
(Finlyandsky vokzal; Финляндский вокзал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; pl Lenina 6; mPloshchad Lenina)
Rebuilt in the 1970s in rectilinear Soviet style, the Finland Station (Finlyandsky vokzal) endures as a place of historical significance, where Lenin finally arrived in 1917 after 17 years in exile abroad. Here he gave his legendary speech from the top of an armoured car to a crowd who had heard of, but never seen, the man.
After fleeing a second time he again arrived here from Finland, this time disguised as a railway fireman, and the locomotive he rode in is displayed behind glass on the platform.
Walk out onto the square that still bears Lenin’s name and you’ll see a marvellous statue of the man himself at the far end.
SITE OF PUSHKIN’S DUELHISTORIC SITE
(Место дуэли Пушкина GOOGLE MAP ; Kolomyazhsky pr; mChyornaya Rechka)
Russia’s poetic genius, Alexander Pushkin, was fatally wounded in a duel here with the Frenchman Georges d’Anthès on 8 February 1837. A granite monument marks the alleged spot, today a small park surrounded by fast-moving traffic.
From the metro station at Chyornaya Rechka, walk down Torzhkovskaya ul and turn left at the first light on Novosibirskaya ul. Walk straight to the end of the road, cross the train tracks and enter the park.

It's well worth the effort making the trip out to see this magnificent collection of street art set inside a former 11-hectare industrial site. You'll find a wide variety of formats, from huge murals covering walls to mixed-media installations set inside a former boilerhouse. Every year, the exhibition changes, with top artists from around the globe invited to contribute on themes like Revolution (featured in 2017 on the 100-year anniversary of Russia's October Revolution), Migrants and Peace.
Intriguingly, parts of this industrial complex are still active, with workers at the laminated plastics factory SLOPAST surrounded by the encroaching artwork. Some of the workshops are decorated with epic works by the likes of top Russian street artists Timothy Radya, Kirill Kto and Nikita Nomerz, as well as the Spanish artist Escif. Before he died in 2013, Pasha 183 – frequently referred to as Russia's Banksy because of his anonymity – also contributed 'Walls Don't Sleep', a beautiful monochrome mural based on an image of Soviet factory workers.
Guided tours take place on weekends (at 1pm and 2pm); call ahead to ensure an English-speaking guide is on hand. The museum also hosts outdoor concerts and other big events. Check the website for the latest.
It's located in the industrial zone of Okhta, a 20-minute bus ride east of Ploshchad Lenina. Buses 28, 37 and 137 all go there.

This treasure trove of Soviet ephemera, pre-revolutionary antiques, WWII artefacts and bonkers kitsch from all eras is truly worth travelling for. Exit the metro station to the right and follow the crowds across the train tracks. Continue beyond the large permanent market, which is of very little interest, until you come to a huge area of independent stalls, all varying in quality and content.
The sheer size of the place means you’ll really have to comb it to find the gems.

The luxe baths (only open to women on Wednesday and Saturday) also grant you access to the heated circular open-air pool. There are private facilities, too.
1METRO ART
Beautiful interior design is not just for palaces and galleries in St Petersburg – it is also found across the city’s metro system. Red Line 1, the first to be opened in 1955, is particularly striking for its station designs, but other newer stations also have artistic flourishes.

Day Trips from St Petersburg

Peterhof
The most popular day trip from St Petersburg is to Peter the Great’s spectacular summer palace and grounds on the Gulf of Finland, easily reached from central St Petersburg by hydrofoil from outside the Admiralty.
Pushkin & Pavlovsk
Tsarskoe Selo (in the town of Pushkin) and Pavlovsk are two beautiful palaces and grounds next door to one another. This is a great day trip to see the summer palaces of Catherine the Great and Paul I.
Vyborg
Situated on the Gulf of Finland, this appealing town is features a medieval castle and an abundance of art-nouveau buildings. An easy day trip from St Petersburg, Vyborg offers enough for longer stays.
Repino
Part of Finland in the mid-20th-century, this village has long back in Russian hands and makes for a pleasant, outdoorsy day trip from St Petersburg.
Kronshtadt
Closed to foreigners until 1996, Kronshtadt's offering of history, cruises and naval might makes for a fascinating day trip destination.


TOP SIGHT
PETERHOF
The fountains are incredible, the palace is a stunner and the grounds are great for walking, so it’s no surprise that Peter the Great’s summer palace is usually the first-choice day trip for visitors to St Petersburg. Peterhof is no secret, however, so come early in the day or out of season to enjoy it without the crowds.

Peter's Summer Palace
Hugging the Gulf of Finland, 29km west of St Petersburg, Peterhof – the ‘Russian Versailles’ – is a far cry from the original cabin Peter the Great had built here to oversee construction of the Kronshtadt naval base. Peter liked the place so much he built a villa, Monplaisir, here and then a whole series of palaces and ornate gardens. Peterhof was renamed Petrodvorets (Peter’s Palace) in 1944 but has since reverted to its original name. The palace and buildings are surrounded by leafy gardens and a spectacular ensemble of gravity-powered fountains.
What you see today is largely a reconstruction, as Peterhof was a major casualty of WWII. Apart from the damage done by the Germans, the palace suffered the worst under Soviet bombing raids in December 1941 and January 1942, because Stalin was determined to thwart Hitler’s plan of hosting a New Year’s victory celebration here.
The Lower Park
The Lower Park contains most of Peterhof’s sights and is where you will arrive if you take the hydrofoil from St Petersburg to get here. Forming the lion’s share of the palace grounds, it boasts an incredible symphony of gravity-powered golden fountains, beautiful waterways and interesting historical buildings, making it one of St Petersburg’s most dazzling attractions.
Criss-crossed by bridges and bedecked by smaller sprays, Water Avenue ( GOOGLE MAP ; hMay-Sep) is a canal leading from the hydrofoil dock to the palace. It culminates in the magnificent Grand Cascade, a symphony of over 140 fountains engineered in part by Peter himself. The central statue of Samson tearing open a lion’s jaws celebrates – as so many things in St Petersburg do – Peter’s victory over the Swedes at Poltava. Shooting up 62m, it was unveiled by Rastrelli for the 25th anniversary of the battle in 1735.
Grand Palace
The Grand Palace is an imposing edifice, although with 30-something rooms, it’s not as large as many tsarist palaces. From the start of June to the end of September foreign tourists can visit only between 10.30am and noon, and again from 2.30pm until 4.15pm, due to guided tours being given only in Russian at other times. (While you have to enter the palace as part of a guided tour, it’s quite possible to slip away.)
While Peter’s palace was relatively modest, Rastrelli grossly enlarged the building for Empress Elizabeth. Later, Catherine the Great toned things down a little with a redecoration, although that’s not really apparent from the glittering halls and art-filled galleries that are here today. All of the paintings, furniture and chandeliers are original, as everything was removed from the premises before the Germans arrived in WWII. The Chesme Hall is full of huge paintings of Russia’s destruction of the Turkish fleet at Çesme in 1770. Other highlights include the exquisite East and West Chinese Cabinets, Peter’s study and the Picture Hall, which lives up to its name, with hundreds of portraits crowding its walls. The Throne Room is the biggest in the palace, and the centrepiece is Peter’s red velvet throne.
After WWII, Peterhof was largely left in ruins. Hitler had intended to throw a party here when his plans to occupy the Astoria Hotel were thwarted. He drew up pompous invitations, which obviously incensed his Soviet foes. Stalin’s response was to preempt any such celebration by bombing the estate himself, in the winter of 1941–42, so it is ironic but true that most of the damage at Peterhof occurred at the hands of the Soviets.
Monplaisir
This far more humble, sea-facing villa was always Peter the Great’s favourite retreat. It’s easy to see why: Monplaisir (Монплезир GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm late May-early Oct) is wood panelled, snug and elegant, peaceful even when there’s a crowd – which there used to be all the time, what with Peter’s mandatory partying (‘misbehaving’ guests were required to gulp down huge quantities of wine).
Also in this complex is an annexe called the Catherine Building (Екатерининский корпус GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm), which was built by Rastrelli between 1747 and 1755. Its name derives from the fact that Catherine the Great was living in this building when her husband Peter III was overthrown,and it was from here that she set out for the capital to assume the Russian throne. The interior contains the bedroom and study of Alexander I, as well as the huge Yellow Hall. On the right side is the magnificent Bath Building (Банный корпус GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Thu-Tue), built by Quarenghi in 1800, which is nothing special inside.Look out for some more trick fountains in the garden in front of the buildings.

Hermitage
Along the shore to the west, the 1725 Hermitage (Эрмитаж GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R400/250; h10.30am-6pm Wed-Mon May-Oct) is a two-storey yellow-and-white box featuring the ultimate in private dining: special elevators hoist a fully laid table into the imperial presence on the 2nd floor, thereby eliminating any hindrance by servants. The elevators are circular and located directly in front of each diner, whose plate would be lowered, replenished and replaced. The device is demonstrated on Saturdays and Sundays at 1pm, 2pm and 3pm. Further west is yet another palace, Marly, inspired by the Versailles hunting lodge of the same name so loved by Louis XIV.

Cloche fountain, Monplaisir | svetlanak/GETTY IMAGES ©
Park Alexandria
Even on summer weekends, the rambling and overgrown Park Alexandria (Парк Александрия GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R300/200; h9am-10pm) is peaceful and practically empty. Built for Tsar Nicholas I (and named for his tsarina), these grounds offer a sweet retreat from the crowds. Originally named for Alexander Nevsky, the gothic chapel ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R300/200; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun) was completed in 1834 as the private chapel of Nicholas I. Nearby is the cottage (Коттедж GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R500/300; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun) that was built around the same time as his summer residence. Also part of this same ensemble is the beautifully restored Farmer’s Palace (Фермерский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R600/350; h10.30am-6pm Tue-Sun), built here in 1831 as a pavilion in the park and designed to reify pastoral fantasies of rural life for the royal family. It became the home of the teenage Tsarevitch Alexander (later Alexander II), who loved it throughout his life.
Peterhof Town
Outside the palace grounds is the handsome St Peter & Paul Cathedral (Петропавловский собор GOOGLE MAP ; Sankt-Petersburgsky pr; h9am-7pm), and, continuing around the edge of Olgin Prud (Olga’s Pond), the Tsaritsyn and Olgin Pavilions ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/student R700/400; h10.30am-6pm, last entry 4pm), two buildings sitting on islands in the middle of the pond. Nicholas I had these elaborate pavilions built for his wife (Alexandra Fyodorovna) and daughter (Olga Nikolayevna) respectively. Only recently restored and reopened, they boast unique Mediterranean architectural styles reminiscent of Pompeii.
Further down Sankt-Petersburgsky pr is the Raketa Petrodvorets Watch Factory ( GOOGLE MAP ; %926-304 05 91; www.raketa.com; Sankt-Petersburgsky pr 60; h9am-6pm Mon-Fri), one of the town’s biggest employers, which has an on-site shop selling very cool watches.
TICKETS FOR PETERHOF

On arrival, you’ll need to pay to enter the grounds of the palace, known as the Lower Park, and then for each additional sight within it. Sadly, however, it’s not cheap, as you’re paying more than locals and the sights add up, so choose what you want to see carefully. Inexplicably, many museums also have different closing days, although all buildings are open Friday to Sunday. Nearly all tours and posted information are in Russian, so buy an information booklet at the kiosks near the entrances or, in the Grand Palace, take an English-language audio guide. Online tickets can be purchased for the Grand Palace at www.peterhofmuseum.ru, which can avoid long lines in the summer months.
HYDROFOIL

From May to September, the Peterhof Express ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.peterhof-express.com; single/return adult R800/1500, student R600/1000; h10am-6pm) hydrofoil departs from the jetty in front of the Admiralty every 30 minutes from 9am. It’s an expensive but highly enjoyable way to get to Peterhof, and you arrive right in front of the palace. The last hydrofoil leaves Peterhof at 7pm, and the trip takes 30 minutes.
Even though the hydrofoil is fast and convenient, it’s rather expensive. You can save money by getting here by marshrutka. Marshrutky 300,424 and 424A (R80) leave from outside the Avtovo metro station. All pass through the town of Peterhof, immediately outside the palace. Tell the driver you want to go ‘v dvaryéts’ (‘to the palace’) and you’ll be let off near the main entrance to the Upper Garden, on Sankt-Petersburgsky pr.
TRAIN

There’s also a reasonably frequent suburban train (R60, 40 minutes) from Baltic Station (Baltiysky vokzal) to Novy Peterhof, from where you can walk (around 30 minutes) or take any bus except 357 to the fifth stop, which will take another 10 minutes.
NEED TO KNOW

Peterhof is 29km west of St Petersburg.
In the Lower Park itself, the best eating options are the Grand Orangerie ( GOOGLE MAP ; Lower Park; set menus R450-800; h11am-8pm), a cafe in the former palace orangery, or the Shtandart Restaurant (Ресторан Штандарт GOOGLE MAP ; www.restaurantshtandart.spb.ru; Lower Park; mains R590-1300; h11am-8pm), a bigger place with a terrace and views towards the Gulf of Finland. Outside the palace grounds, try the appealing Duck & Drake inside the New Peterhof Hotel ( GOOGLE MAP ; %812-319 1010; www.new-peterhof.com; Sankt Peterburgsky pr 34; s/d from R5000/5900; Ws), where you can eat Russian and European fare (mains R520 to R950).
TOP TIP

Remember to bring mosquito repellent or to keep your legs and arms covered if you’re here during summer; the mosquitoes on the palace grounds are fierce.

TOP SIGHT
PUSHKIN & PAVLOVSK
The sumptuous palaces and sprawling parks at Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk are, thanks to Catherine the Great and Pushkin, entrenched in Russian history and immortalised in literature. These two neighbouring complexes can be combined in a day’s visit – although if you’re not in the mood to rush, there is plenty at both of them to keep you entertained for an entire day.

The Parks
Almost adjacent yet very different in style and design, Tsarskoe Selo and Pavlovsk are both huge imperial estates with impressive gardens, palaces and various other embellishments. Both also have towns that have grown up around them over the centuries. (The town surrounding Tsarskoe Selo was originally called Tsarskoe Selo, too, but changed its name to Pushkin in 1937.)
Tsarskoe Selo (the ‘tsar’s village’) is understandably the big hitter of the two thanks to the beautiful Catherine Palace and its sumptuous grounds. Pavlovsk, just a short bus ride away, is far less visited and much quieter as a result, but its grounds are wilder and arguably even more lovely, and make for a perfect place to get lost in.
Catherine Palace
The centrepiece of Tsarskoe Selo, created under Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine the Great between 1744 and 1796, is the vast baroque Catherine Palace (Екатерининский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; www.tzar.ru; Sadovaya ul 7; adult/student R1000/350, audio guide R150; h10am-4.45pm Wed-Sun), designed by Rastrelli and named after Peter the Great’s second wife. From May to September the palace can only be visited by individuals between noon and 2pm and 4pm and 5pm, otherwise it’s reserved for prebooked tour groups, such is its rightful popularity. The audio guide is well worth taking, as it gives detailed explanations of what you’ll see in each room.
As at the Winter Palace, Catherine the Great had many of Rastrelli’s original interiors remodelled in classical style. Most of the gaudy exterior and 20-odd rooms of the palace have been beautifully restored – compare them to the photographs of the devastation left by the Germans.
The interiors are superb, with highlights including the Great Hall, the Arabesque Hall, the baroque Cavalier’s Dining Room, the White State Dining Room, the Crimson and Green Pilaster Rooms, the Portrait Hall and, of course, the world-famous Amber Room. The panels used in the Amber Room were a gift given to Peter the Great, but not put to any use until 1743 when Elizabeth decided to use them decoratively, after which they were ingeniously incorporated into the walls here. What you see is a reconstruction of the original that disappeared during WWII and is believed to have been destroyed.
Catherine Park
The lovely Catherine Park (Екатерининский парк GOOGLE MAP ; May-Sep R120, Oct-Apr free; h9am-6pm), with its main entrance on Sadovaya ul next to the palace chapel, surrounds the Catherine Palace. It extends around the ornamental Great Pond and contains an array of interesting buildings, follies and pavilions. Near the Catherine Palace, the Cameron Gallery has rotating exhibitions. The park’s outer section focuses on the Great Pond. In summer you can take a ferry boat to the little island to visit the Chesme Column ( GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child R250/150; h11am-6pm May-Sep), a monument to Russia’s victory over the Turkish fleet. Beside the pond, the blue baroque Grotto Pavilion ( GOOGLE MAP ; h10am-5pm Fri-Wed) houses temporary exhibitions in summer. A walk around the Great Pond will reveal other buildings that the royals built over the years, including the very incongruous-looking Turkish Bath with its minaret-style tower, the wonderful Marble Bridge, the Chinese Pavilion and a Concert Hall isolated on an island.
Alexander Palace & Park
A short distance north of the Catherine Palace, and surrounded by the overgrown and tranquil Alexander Park (Александровский парк GOOGLE MAP ; h7am-11pm), is the classical Alexander Palace (Александровский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; Dvortsovaya ul 2). This palace, built by Quarenghi between 1792 and 1796 for the future Alexander I, was the favourite residence of Nicholas II, the last Russian tsar. Only a few rooms are open to visitors, but they’re impressive, with a huge tiger-skin carpet and an extremely ropey portrait of a young Queen Victoria to boot. It’s a poignant and forgotten place that doesn’t get many tourists and is a welcome contrast to the Catherine Palace.
Pavlovsk Great Palace
Between 1781 and 1786, on orders from Catherine the Great, architect Charles Cameron designed the Pavlovsk Great Palace (Большой Павловский дворец GOOGLE MAP ; www.pavlovskmuseum.ru; ul Sadovaya 20; adult/child R600/250; h10am-6pm, closed Tue, Fri & 1st Mon of month) in Pavlovsk. The palace was designated for Catherine’s son Paul (hence the name, Pavlovsk), and it was Paul’s second wife, Maria Fyodorovna, who orchestrated the design of the interiors. Tragically, the original palace was burnt down two weeks after the end of WWII when the cigarette of a careless Soviet soldier set off German mines (the Soviets blamed the Germans). As at Tsarskoe Selo, the restoration is remarkable.
The finest rooms are on the middle floor of the central block. Cameron designed the round Italian Hall beneath the dome and the Grecian Hall to its west, though the lovely green fluted columns were added by his assistant, Vincenzo Brenna. Flanking these are two private suites designed mainly by Brenna: Paul’s along the north side of the block and Maria Fyodorovna’s on the south. The Hall of War of the insane, military-obsessed Paul contrasts with Maria’s Hall of Peace, decorated with musical instruments and flowers. On the middle floor of the south block are Paul’s Throne Room and the Hall of the Maltese Knights of St John, of whom he was the Grand Master.

Pavlovsk Great Park
If you decide to skip the palace, you may simply wish to wander around the serene Pavlovsk Great Park – and as you’ll have to pay to enter them just to access the palace, it’s worth exploring and seeing what you come across. Filled with rivers and ponds, tree-lined avenues, classical statues and hidden temples, it’s a delightful place to get lost. Highlights include the Rose Pavilion (Розовый павильон GOOGLE MAP ; Pavlovsk Park; adult/student R300/150; h11am-6pm Wed-Sun) and the Private Garden (Собственный садик GOOGLE MAP ; Pavlovsk Park; adult/child R250/150; h11am-7pm), with its beautifully arranged flowerbeds and impressive sculpture of the Three Graces. Bike hire is available at several locations around the park and is a great way to explore, as distances are large.
THE MYSTERY OF THE AMBER ROOM

The original Amber Room was created from exquisitely engraved amber panels given to Peter the Great by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia in 1716. Rastrelli later combined the panels with gilded woodcarvings, mirrors, agate and jasper mosaics to decorate one of the rooms of the Catherine Palace. Plundered by the Nazis during WWII, the room’s decorative panels were last exhibited in Königsberg’s castle in 1941. Four years later, with the castle in ruins, the Amber Room was presumed destroyed. Or was it?
In 2004, as Putin and then German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder presided over the opening of the new US$18 million Amber Room, restored largely with German funds, rumours about the original panels continued to swirl. There are those who believe that parts, if not all, of the original Amber Room remain hidden away somewhere and have survived (see www.amberroom.org).

This appealing Gulf of Finland provincial town is dominated by a medieval castle and peppered with beautiful Finnish art nouveau buildings and romantic cobblestone streets.
The border has jumped back and forth around Vyborg for most of its history. Peter the Great captured it from the Swedes in 1710. A century later it fell within autonomous Finland, and after the revolution Vyborg remained part of independent Finland. Since then the Finns have called it Viipuri. Stalin took Vyborg in 1939, lost it to the Finns during WWII, and on getting it back at the end of the war deported all the Finns. Today the Finns are back by the coachloads for sightseeing and carousing on the weekends.

Rising stoutly from an islet in Vyborg Bay, this castle was built by the Swedes in 1293 when they first captured Karelia from Novgorod. Most of it now consists of 16th-century alterations. The castle contains several exhibition halls, including a mildly diverting small museum ( GOOGLE MAP ; R100; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun) on local history, but the main attraction is climbing the many steps of whitewashed St Olaf’s Tower ( GOOGLE MAP ) for commanding views over the town (closed for renovations at time of research).

A must-see for architecture fans is the beautifully designed public library, one of Finnish architect Alvar Aalto's iconic designs. After years of restoration, the 1935 building looks lovelier than ever, with painstaking efforts to return it to Aalto's original vision. Handmade bronze-handled doors, circular skylights in the reading room, and elegant birchwood shelves are among the many features. It's still a working public library, open to all (though oddly, it lacks wi-fi).

Come summer, Petersburgers stream out of the city to relax on the beaches to the north between Sestroretsk and Zelenogorsk on the Gulf of Finland. Between these two towns you’ll find the village of Repino, 45km from St Petersburg. From 1918 to the end of WWII, this area was part of Finland and the village was known as Kuokkala. In 1948, back in Russian hands, the village was renamed in honour of its most famous resident, Ilya Repin.

Repin bought land here in 1899, named the estate after a Roman household god and designed the light-flooded house in an arts-and-crafts style. The artist produced many of his later works here, and several of his paintings still hang on the walls. The furnishings have been left just as they were during Repin’s residence, which was up to his death in 1930. His grave, marked by a simple Russian Orthodox wooden cross, is in the park, along with a couple of wooden follies also designed by Repin.

Aside from taking in one grand neo-Byzantine church and visiting a little-visited corner of greater St Petersburg, this is a fine place for seeing Russia’s mighty naval centre, and getting an overview of the bay on a boat tour.
Within a year of founding St Petersburg, Peter – desirous of protecting his new Baltic toehold – started work on the fortress of Kronshtadt on Kotlin Island, 29km out in the Gulf of Finland. It’s been a pivotal Soviet and Russian naval base ever since, and was closed to foreigners until 1996.

KRONSHTADT REBELLION

In 1921 the hungry and poor Red Army sailors stationed here organised an ill-fated mutiny against the Bolsheviks. They set up a Provisional Revolutionary Committee and drafted a resolution demanding, among other things, an end to Lenin’s harsh War Communism. On 16 March 1921 the mutineers were defeated when 50,000 troops crossed the ice from Petrograd and massacred nearly the entire naval force. The sailors’ stand wasn’t entirely in vain, as afterwards Lenin did scrap War Communism.





Transport

ARRIVING IN ST PETERSBURG
St Petersburg is well connected to the rest of Europe by plane, train, ferry and bus. The vast majority of travellers arrive in St Petersburg by air at Pulkovo Airport. Flight time from London and Paris to St Petersburg is three hours, from Berlin it’s a two-hour flight, and from Moscow it’s under an hour.
Train is also a popular way to get here – from Moscow there are pleasantly slow overnight sleeper trains as well as six to eight fast four-hour daytime Sapsan trains. See www.rzd.ru for details. From Helsinki there are four daily Allegro express trains that take you from the Finnish capital to St Petersburg in an impressive 3½ hours. See www.vr.fi for prices and timetables.
An increasing number of travellers arrive at one of St Petersburg’s five cruise and ferry terminals. There are regular connections between St Petersburg and Stockholm (22 to 24 hours), Tallinn (14 hours) and Helsinki (10 hours). Those who arrive this way also have the option of 72-hour visa-free travel. See St Peter Line for prices and timetables.
Flights, cars and tours can be booked online at lonelyplanet.com.
Pulkovo International Airport
Most travellers arrive in St Petersburg at Pulkovo International Airport (LED; GOOGLE MAP ; %812-337 3822; www.pulkovoairport.ru; Pulkovskoye sh), 23km south of the city. This terminal building, which opened in 2014, and is confusingly still referred to as Terminal 1, handles all domestic and international flights and is St Petersburg's only airport.
Taxi
Taking a taxi from the airport to the city centre has never been easier or safer. Leave the terminal building and outside you'll find an official taxi dispatcher who will ask you for your destination's address, indicate which taxi to go to and write you a price on a slip of official paper that you can then give to your driver. Prices vary, but expect to pay between R800 and R1000 to reach the centre, depending on where exactly you’re headed. Drivers usually won’t speak much English, so just hand over the money on arrival – you don’t need to tip. It's also possible to book a trip into the city via a taxi app for around R700.
Marshrutka & Bus
For those on a budget, marshrutka (minibus) K39 shuttles you from outside the terminal building to the nearest metro station, Moskovskaya (R35, every five minutes, from 7am to 11.30pm). The bus terminates at the Moskovskaya metro station, so you don’t need to worry about where to get off, and you can connect to the rest of the city from there.
There's also bus 39 (R40, every 15 minutes, from 5.30am to 1.30am) that runs the same route over longer hours, but trundles along somewhat more slowly.
Moscow Station
If you’re arriving from Moscow, you’ll come to the Moscow Station (Moskovsky vokzal; Московский вокзал MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.moskovsky-vokzal.ru; Nevsky pr 85; mPloshchad Vosstaniya) (Moskovsky vokzal), in the centre of the city. There are two metro stations close by: pl Vosstaniya (Line 1) and Mayakovskaya (Line 3). To get here (you can enter both stations through one building) turn left outside the main entrance to the Moscow Station, and the exit is in one side of the building on Ligovsky pr.
Finland Station
Trains from Helsinki arrive at the Finland Station (Финляндский вокзал; Finlyandsky vokzal MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.finlyandsky.dzvr.ru; pl Lenina 6; mPloshchad Lenina) (Finlyandsky vokzal). From here you can connect to anywhere in the city by metro from the Ploshchad Lenina station (Line 1) on the square outside the station.
Ladoga Station
Some trains from the Leningradskaya Oblast and those from Helsinki to Moscow stop en route in St Petersburg at the Ladoga Station (Ladozhsky vokzal; Ладожский вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; http://lvspb.ru; Zanevsky pr 73; mLadozhskaya) (Ladozhsky vokzal). It’s served by the Ladozhskaya metro station (Line 4).
BUYING TICKETS IN ST PETERSBURG

You’ll most likely have your onward travel tickets when you arrive in St Petersburg, but if not it’s easy to purchase tickets for boat, bus, train and plane travel. First of all, try online – you can buy train tickets (www.rzd.ru), bus tickets (www.luxexpress.eu) and, of course, airline tickets via websites.
Buying train tickets in person can be done at any train station (even at a different terminus from where your train departs), although waiting time can be long if you buy them at a counter. Far quicker are the new ticket machines, which all work in English and where you can usually pay with either cash or credit card. Another option is the centrally located Train Tickets Centre (Кассы ЖД MAP GOOGLE MAP ; nab kanala Griboyedova 24; h8am-8pm Mon-Sat, until 6pm Sun; mGostiny Dvor), where there are also ticket machines, which makes waiting in line unnecessary.
You can buy ferry tickets for nearly all boats at the Ferry Centre (Паромный центр MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-327 3377; www.paromy.ru; ul Vosstaniya 19; h10am-7pm Mon-Fri; mPloshchad Vosstaniya), a short walk from the Moscow Station. Alternatively, it’s possible to buy ferry tickets in the Sea Port at the far-flung end of Vasilyevsky Island, as well as online through the ferry companies themselves.
If time is tight, then nearly all travel agencies can organise onward travel tickets for you, although of course there’s usually a markup on the cost and a delivery fee.
Bus Station
St Petersburg’s main bus station, Avtovokzal (Автобусный вокзал GOOGLE MAP ; %812-766 5777; www.avokzal.ru; nab Obvodnogo kanala 36; mObvodny Kanal), has bus connections to cities all over western Russia, including Veliky Novgorod, but most travellers won’t use it. If you do happen to arrive here, it’s a short walk along the canal to the metro station Obvodny Kanal (Line 5).
Sea Ports
There are a number of places where cruise ships arrive in St Petersburg, while all ferries from elsewhere in the Baltic arrive at the Sea Port on Vasilyevsky Island. Anyone on a river cruise from Moscow will arrive at the River Passenger Terminal in the south of the city, which is a short walk away from the Proletarskaya metro station (Line 3). Upon leaving the metro turn right onto pr Obukhovskoy Oborony and it’s five minutes up the road.
Marine Facade Terminal
The Marine Facade Terminal at the far end of Vasilyevsky Island is a relatively new facility. It’s not in the city centre, but all shore excursion operators have buses or cars for their passengers, and the journey to the Hermitage can be done in 30 minutes. The nearest metro station is Primorskaya, from where it’s just two stops to Gostiny Dvor (Line 3) in the Historic Heart, but it's a good 30-minute walk away and you'd be advised to arrange a taxi. Head down the main road from the Marine Facade, then once you’ve crossed Nalichnaya ul, take Novosmolenskaya nab and you’ll reach the station.
For taxis, an official dispatch stand is in the arrivals area, with fixed rates to various places around town. You’ll be given a slip of paper with the price you need to pay the driver: prices average from R200 to R400 depending on where in the centre you want to go.
Sea Port
If you’re arriving by ferry from Stockholm, Tallinn or Helsinki then you’ll disembark at the Sea Port in the southern corner of Vasilyevsky Island. It’s not served by the metro, so your easiest way into the city centre is to take a taxi. Drivers wait outside the terminal or you can order a taxi by phone app; prices average from R200 to R400 depending on where in the centre you want to go.
An alternative option is to take bus 7 (R40) from the main road outside. The bus should have pl Vosstaniya (Пл Восстания) written on it, and it goes all the way down Sredny pr, crosses the Neva at the Hermitage and then goes down Nevsky pr to pl Vosstaniya.
St Peter Line offers a €25 'tour package' bus service that shuttles passengers to St Isaac's Cathedral and back again every hour.
Other Ports
There are three other docks where cruise ships sometimes arrive in St Petersburg. Smaller cruise ships usually dock on either the English Embankment Passenger Terminal or the Lieutenant Schmidt Passenger Terminal. Neither terminal has much in the way of facilities, but both are centrally located and you’re within easy walking distance of the sights in the Historic Heart.
One far less attractive possibility is docking at the St Petersburg Sea Port, which is the main commercial and industrial port in the city. It’s on Gutuyevsky Island and a long way from anything. It’s technically possible to walk out of the port to the Narvskaya metro station, but reckon on a 30-minute walk through a fairly miserable industrial area. If you decide to walk, head up Obvodny Canal and then turn right onto Staropetrogovsky pr and you’ll see Narvskaya metro station on pl Stachek.
GETTING AROUND
Metro Fastest way to cover long distances. Has around 70 stations and runs from approximately 5.45am to 12.45am.
Bus, Trolleybus & Marshrutky Buses are best for shorter distances in areas without good metro coverage; they can be slow going, but the views are good. Trolleybuses are slower still, but are cheap and plentiful. Marshrutky are the private sector's contribution – fast fixed-route minibuses that you can get on or off anywhere along their routes.
Tram Largely obsolete and little used, but still useful in areas such as Kolomna and Vasilyevsky Island where there is little else available.
Metro
The St Petersburg Metro (%8-800- 350 1155; www.metro.spb.ru; h6am-12.45am) is a very efficient five-line system. The network of some 70 stations is most usefully employed for travelling long distances, especially connecting the suburbs to the city centre. New stations are being added and it's possible that the one at Teatralnaya, next to the Mariinsky Theatre, will be operational by 2020.
Look for signs with a big blue ‘M’ signifying the entrance to the metro. The flat fare for a trip is R45; you will have to buy an additional ticket if you are carrying a significant amount of baggage. If you wish to buy a single journey, ask for ‘adin proyezd’ and you will be given a zheton (token) to put in the machine.
If you are staying more than a day or two, however, it’s worth buying a smart card (R60), which is good for multiple journeys to be used over the course of a fixed time period – for example, 10 trips in seven days for R355. Their main advantage is that you won’t have to line up to buy tickets – the ticket counters can have very long lines during peak hours.
The metro system is fully signed in English, so it’s quite easy to use, even for first-timers in Russia.
Bus, Marshrutka & Trolleybus
Buses, and particularly marshrutky (minibuses), are a very handy way to get around the city and they tend to cover routes that the metro doesn’t, making them essential for certain parts of town. Most travellers find taking them a bit daunting, however, as there’s little signage in English. On both buses and trolleybuses, you get on and then pay a conductor; the fare is R40.
Marshrutky can be flagged down anywhere along their route (there are no bus stops for marshrutky). Open the door yourself and jump in, then once you’ve taken your seat you pay the driver (pass the money via your fellow passengers if you’re not sitting within reaching distance); the rates are usually posted on the inside of the bus near the driver. You’ll also need to request the stop you want – usually announcing to the driver the name of the street or the place you’re going to shortly before you get there. Alternatively, when you want to get off, simply say (or shout!): ‘AstanavEEtye pazhalsta!’ ('Stop please!') and the driver will pull over as soon as possible.
Taxi
Taxi apps, such as Gett and Yandex Taxi, are all the rage in St Petersburg and they've brought down the prices of taxis in general, while improving the service a great deal.
Aside from the apps, the best way to get a taxi is to order it by phone. Operators will usually not speak English, so unless you speak Russian, ask your hotel reception to call a taxi for you. It also remains possible to flag down a random car in the street and negotiate the price, keeping in mind all security caveats.
Peterburgskoe Taksi 068 (%812-324 7777, in St Petersburg 068; www.taxi068.ru)
Taxi-4 (%812-333 4333; www.taxi-4.ru)

Taxi 6000000 (%812-600 0000; http://6-000-000.ru) Has operators and drivers who speak English.
Bicycle
Despite the local traffic being still in the learning stages about basic respect for cyclists, this is a great way to get around this huge and flat city.
ASome youth hostels and bike shops, such as Rentbike and Skladnye Velosipedy (Складные Велосипеды MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %812-748 1407; www.shulzbikes.ru; Goncharnaya ul 20; bike hire per day/24 hr R700/1000; h11am-9pm), hire bikes for as little as R500 per day.
AIf you're keen to do a lot of cycling, bring a helmet, bike lights and a good lock from home, as these are hard to come by.
AVelogorod (%812-648 2100; http://spb.velogorod.org; ride/day pass R45/129) is a handy bike-sharing system with 56 stations across the city. You'll need to use the website or download the app to hire one of their bicycles.
BRIDGE TIMETABLE

From mid-April until late November major bridges across the Neva rise at the following times overnight to allow ships to pass through the city. It's rare that the Grenadersky, Kantemirovsky and Sampsonievsky Bridges over the Bolshaya Nevka River (connecting the Vyborg and Petrograd Sides) are raised and, if so, two days' notice is given beforehand. You can check the full, up-to-date timetable at www.razvodka-mostov.ru (in Russian only).
Because of the new fixed suspension bridges on the Western High Speed Diameter highway across the mouth of the Neva you will not be stuck either side of the river when the bridges go up. Note also that between May and the end of November the M5 metro line shuttles every 20 minutes back and forth between Admiralteyskaya and Sportivnaya stations between 1am and 3am on Saturday and Sunday and the eve of public holidays, creating an easy way to get between the islands and the Historic Heart.
