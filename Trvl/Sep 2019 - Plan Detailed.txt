trio of marvellous national parks:
	Hardangervidda, a vast mountain plateau of lunar-like appearance
	Rondane, with its bulging mountains
	Jotunheimen, famous for its jagged peaks
	
	
Dovrefjell-Sunndalsfjella Nasjonalpark
Reached via the E6 and the Dombås–Trondheim railway, the eastern reaches of this large park are rugged and severe, but as you hike west the terrain gets even wilder as the serrated alpine peaks of the Romsdal hove into view.


Hardangervidda Nasjonalpark
Europe’s largest mountain plateau, stretches east from the Hardangerfjord to Finse in the north and Rjukan in the east, its bare, almost lunar-like rocks and myriad lakes make for some spectacular hiking. The Hardangervidda begins about 130km east of Bergen.


Jotunheimen Nasjonalpark
Norway’s most famous hiking area has a heady concentration of towering, ice-tipped peaks, more than two hundred rising above 1900m, including northern Europe’s two highest. The park is near the east end of the Sognefjord, about 300km from Oslo.


Rondane Nasjonalpark
The Rondane comprises both a high alpine zone, with ten peaks exceeding the 2000-metre mark, and a much gentler upland area punctuated by rounded, treeless hills. It is on the E6 between Oslo and Trondheim and is especially popular with families.


Nordre Isfjorden Nasjonalpark, Svalbard
One of the archipelago’s largest protected areas, this coastal tundra stretches across the Isfjorden north of Barentsburg. It comprises wetlands, lake and pond complexes, and is great for light day-hikes and wildlife-spotting; wildlife includes eider ducks, pink-footed geese, ringed seals, arctic fox and the Svalbard rock ptarmigan.	
	
	
	
	
	
Skagerrak, the south coast 
pint-sized ports, the most inviting being Arendal and Mandal

sea-kayaking at Flåm

rugged Lofoten islands

Nordkapp (North Cape)

wondrous chill of Svalbard, rising remote in the Arctic seas, islands of rolling glaciers and ice-glazed mountains where the snowmobile or Zodiac is more useful than a car

GRAND TOUR
Spend two weeks – though three would be ideal – following the country’s invigorating, surf-battered coast, experiencing its laidback cities and wild landscapes en route.

1 Oslo Allow yourself a few days in the Norwegian capital, taking in its parks, museums, seafood restaurants and bars.


2 Stavanger Stroll through the atmospheric old town, visit the canning museum, boat out to the dramatic Lysefjord and then climb up to Pulpit Rock.


3 Bergen This lovely old port is celebrated for its handsome coastal setting and fine wooden architecture. Time your stay to coincide with a festival – Nattjazz, for instance.


4 Bergen to Trondheim by boat No Norwegian holiday would be complete without a sea cruise – sit back and enjoy the views from the Hurtigruten.


5 Trondheim Trondheim features a magnificent cathedral, a charming old city centre and is a great springboard for points north.


6 Lofoten With its rearing peaks and turbulent ocean, this archipelago is Norway at its most beautiful.


7 Tromsø Home to lively restaurants and simmering bars, this “Paris of the north” is the perfect spot to 

spend a few days gearing up for an excursion into the depths of the Arctic hinterlands.


8 Nordkapp The northern end of mainland Europe, this jagged promontory pokes a knobbly finger out into the Arctic Sea.







THE WESTERN FJORDS
Starting from Bergen, this fjord itinerary will take about ten days – fourteen if you add a hike or two – at a comfortable pace by car, and a little longer by public transport.

1 Lofthus Snuggling the Sørfjord, this lovely little village sits amid fruit orchards – and is within a day’s hike of the Hardangervidda mountain plateau.


2 Trolltunga Hike up to this remarkable overhang – the “Troll’s Tongue” – for a truly incredible view.


3 Balestrand Loveable village with an exquisite setting, its huddle of houses pressing up against the mountains.

4 Solvorn From this quaint hamlet, which ambles up from the Lustrafjord, you can visit the remarkable Urnes stave church.


5 Mundal, Fjærlandsfjord Isolated until the 1980s, the Fjærlandsfjord is gloriously wild. From Mundal you can hike up into the hills to long-abandoned mountain farms.


6 Jostedalsbreen glacier A guided walk on this groaning, creaking glacier, one of the largest in Europe, is a must.


7 Cruise the Geirangerfjord Hemmed in by mountains, this fjord is truly spectacular, and the boat cruise along it a real treat.


8 Ålesund Draped around its pretty, little harbour, this delightful town boasts a confetti of Art Nouveau buildings.








ARCTIC NORWAY
The more northerly stretches of Norway’s beguiling coast beckon with gorgeous indigo light, a distinctly warm camaradarie and limitless outdoor activities – perfect for a couple of weeks’ heart-pounding adventure.

1 Maelstrom in Saltstraumen Experience the world’s strongest tidal whirlpool, which sends some 400 million tonnes of water through the coastline’s narrow fjords, sometimes producing an uncanny yelping sound.

2 Cross-country skiing in Kabelvåg Spend a day or two skiing across the powdered marshes and soaring mountains of this up-and-coming destination.

3 Climbing in Svolvær Hike up from Svolvær to the Svolværgeita (the “Svolvær Goat”), a nerve-jangling, two-pronged pinnacle that rises high above town.

3 Polar Light Center in Laukvik
This specially designed centre gets you closest to the elusive northern lights – bright, fiery tapestries of light that flicker across the heavens.

4 Whale-watching in Vesterålen Pilots, minke and humpback congregate here amid the Vesterålen’s nutrient-rich waters, which are perfect for whale-watching excursions.

5 Dog-sledding outside Karasjok Harness, rig, and prep your pack of snow-white Siberian huskies and head off on the Arctic’s Formula 1 – a day-long sledding safari.

6 Sleep in an igloo, Kirkenes Jump into an expedition-strength sleeping bag and drift off to sleep in a room made out of blocks of snow and ice.s

7 Explore the ends of the Earth on Svalbard Ride the fjords in a rugged Zodiac or snowmobile out to an abandoned satellite-station-turned-guesthouse, the perfect base for snowy wilderness exploration.

	Svetitskhoveli Cathedral
		Mtskheta Jew, Elioz, was in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus' Crucifixion and returned with the robe to Mtskheta. His sister Sidonia took it from him and immediately died in a passion of faith. The robe was buried with her and as years passed, people forgot the exact site. When King Mirian built the first church at Mtskheta in the 4th century, the wooden column designed to stand in its centre could not be raised from the ground. But after an all-night prayer vigil by St Nino, the column miraculously moved of its own accord to the robe's burial site. The column subsequently worked many miracles and Svetitskhoveli means ‘Life-Giving Column’.

              This extraordinary underground passageway, 350m long, was built by the Knights Templar (a Christian military order) to connect their main fortress, just north of the black-and-white-striped lighthouse at Old Akko's southwestern tip, with the marina (Khan al-Umdan). It was discovered by accident in 1994. You can enter at either end; tickets to all the Crusaders sites are sold at both access points. Inside, buttons let you start films in either Hebrew or English.

              Wedged into the upper ramparts in the far northeastern corner of the old city, this museum is laid out like a Galilee town souq (market) of the late Ottoman 
period, with blacksmith, tinsmith, potter, primus repair shop, pharmacy, hat maker and woodworking shop, all outfitted with period tools, equipment and furnishings (eg gorgeous inlaid furniture from Damascus). The entrance is up on the Land Wall Promenade, accessible from street level via a number of staircases.

              Topped by a large green dome and accented by a slender pencil minaret, Al-Jazzar Mosque was built in 1781 in typical Ottoman Turkish style – with some local improvisation: the columns in the courtyard, for example, were ‘adopted’ from Roman Caesarea. Around by the base of the minaret, the small twin-domed building contains the sarcophagi of Al-Jazzar and his adopted son and successor, Süleyman.
            
            
              This mosque is the third most important mosque in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, after Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem and the Ibrahimi Mosque (Tomb of the Patriarchs) in Hebron. It stands on the site of a former Crusader cathedral, the cellars of which were put into use by the Turks as cisterns.

              Dedicated to Jewish armed resistance during the British Mandate, this museum occupies a massive 
structure built by the Turks in the late 18th century on 13th-century Crusader foundations and used as a prison by both the Ottomans and the British. People jailed here included Revisionist Zionist leader Ze’ev Jabotinsky (from 1920 to 1921) and eight Jewish underground fighters who were executed by hanging, most of them in 1947 (the gallows room is open to the public).

              Old Akko has four large khans (caravanserais) whose courtyards – surrounded by colonnaded storerooms and, upstairs, sleeping quarters – once served camel caravans bringing grain from, and imported goods to, the hinterland. The grandest is the 18th-century Khan al-Umdan, easily recognisable thanks to its square Ottoman clock tower, which is next to the marina. The pillars that give the khan its name were appropriated from Caesarea.
            
            
              Plans to convert the complex into a hotel are stalled, so the site is in limbo, but visits may be possible from the nearby entrance to the Templars' Tunnel.
              The other khans are easier to visit. Khan ash-Shawarda, just south of Salah ad-Din St, was recently spruced up and now shelters a number of restaurants. The courtyards of Khan al-Faranj, a few blocks southwest, and Khan ash-Shune, a few steps west of the eastern entrance to the Templars' Tunnel, are accessible through open archways.

Dangers & Annoyances
          
            Old Akko shuts down after dark, and while most people feel comfortable strolling around after nightfall, women walking alone have been subject to unwanted attention and occasional sexual harassment.

        Baha'i Gardens & Shrine of Baha'ullah
        
          The holiest site in the Baha’i faith is not in Haifa but near Akko, for it is here that Baha’ullah, founder of the faith, lived after his release from an Akko prison and where he died in 1892. The lovely formal gardens, with their meticulously tended flower beds and fountains, are similar in style to those in Haifa. At the far end of the gardens is the Shrine of Baha'ullah (www.bahaullah.com; h9am-noon Fri-Mon), his final resting place. Bahji House, where he lived from 

1879 to 1892, is open only to Baha'i pilgrims. For both men and women, knees and shoulders need to be covered.
          Akko's main Baha'i sites are 4.5km northeast of Akko's old city; the turn-off from Rte 8510 is opposite the entrance to the religious community of Moshav Bustan HaGalil. Buses that pass by this way include Nateev Express bus 271 (every 10 to 15 minutes Sunday to Friday afternoon, every 45 to 60 minutes Saturday evening), which serves Nahariya (one hour), Akko (25 minutes) and Haifa-Merkazit HaMifratz (50 minutes).
        
      
      
        Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta’ot
        
          Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot (the name means Ghetto Fighters’ Kibbutz) was established in 1949 by Jews who spent WWII fighting the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto and the forests of Poland and Lithuania. Founded the same year as the kibbutz, Beit Lohamei HaGeta’ot (Ghetto Fighters' House Museum; www.gfh.org.il; adult/child incl Yad Layeled 30/20NIS; h9am-4pm Sun-Thu) – the first museum in the world dedicated to the Holocaust – focuses on Jewish resistance, including the uprisings in the ghettos and camps and the bravery of the partisans.
          The adjacent Yad Layeled Children’s Memorial Museum (adult/child incl Beit Lohamei HaGeta’ot 
30/20NIS; h9am-4pm Sun-Thu), appropriate for children 10 and over, is a moving memorial to the 1.5 million Jewish children who perished in the Holocaust. The hands-on exhibit include films, period artefacts and the stories and testimonies of children who lived during those terrible times.
          Just south of the kibbutz, on the eastern side of Rte 4, you can see an Ottoman aqueduct, built by Al-Jazzar around 1780 to supply Akko with water from the Galilee uplands.
          The kibbutz is on Rte 4 about midway between Akko and Nahariya. The many buses that pass by this way, linking the two cities, include Nateev Express 271 (every 10 to 15 minutes Sunday to Friday afternoon, every 45 to 60 minutes Saturday evening).
        
      
      
        WORTH A TRIPROSH HANIKRA GROTTOES
        
          The volatile border between Israel and Lebanon comes to an appropriately rugged and dramatic head at Rosh HaNikra, a frontier-straddling bluff where jagged white cliffs of limestone and chalk plunge into the deep blue sea. Turn on a radio here and many of the stations will be from Cyprus, a corner of the European Union just 250km to the northeast.
          The 10km road from Nahariya ends at the Rosh HaNikra Grottoes (%073-271 0100; www.rosh-hanikra.com), from where a cable car (adult/child 45/35NIS; h9am-4pm Sun-Fri, to 6pm Sat Sep-Mar, 9am-6pm Sat-Thu, to 4pm Fri Apr-Jun) – made by an Austrian ski-lift company – descends steeply to the bottom of the flint-speckled cliffs. Inside the grottoes, lit by the 
luminescent blue of the Mediterranean, waves crash with awesome power against the bone-white walls. The site is at its most dramatic during stormy weather. The cable car is wheelchair accessible, but the caves are not. It's a good idea to wear sensible shoes with grippy soles.
          Behind the lower cable-car station, inside a naturally cool rail tunnel, you can watch a film on the area's geography and the history of the Haifa–Beirut railway, whose tunnels were excavated by British army engineering units from New Zealand and South Africa in 1941 and 1942. Unsurprisingly, the line has been out of commission since 1948.
          At the ticket windows, it’s possible to hire a bike (including the grottoes 72NIS) for the 5km round-trip ride to Betzet Beach.
          Up top, you can peer through a camouflaged border gate on the Israel–Lebanon border. A few kilometres north is the Naqoura base of the 12,000-member United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil), which has been patrolling the border since 1978.
          If you're hungry, there's a snack bar down below and a cafeteria next to the border gate.
          Nateev Exprees bus 31 links Rosh HaNikra with Nahariya (7.40NIS, 17 minutes, every 1½ to two hours except Shabbat).

          Founded by German-Jewish refugees in 1935, Nahariya still feels a bit like a Central European beach resort of the interwar era. The town's focal point is 1km-long HaGa'aton Blvd, lined with cafes, ice-
cream joints, flower shops and places to eat, which runs along both banks of the eucalyptus-shaded Ga'aton River (actually a concrete canal). This slightly shabby boulevard links the bus and train stations with the beachfront promenade, where folk dancing, concerts and other entertainments are often held, especially in summer. Nahariya makes a good base for exploring the area between Haifa and the Lebanese border.

        Montfort
        
          Built by the noble De Milly family, Montfort is not the most impressive of Israel’s Crusader castles (Nimrod's Castle is much more stirring), but it's interesting enough and a visit here involves a pleasant hike. The castle’s name was changed from Montfort ('strong mountain' in French) to Starkenberg ('strong mountain' in German) when the De Millys sold it to the Teutonic knights. In 1271 the Muslims, led by the Mamluk sultan Beybars, took the castle after a previous attempt, five years earlier, had failed. The Crusaders surrendered and retreated to Akko.

Little except the view can be seen today. To the right of the entrance is the governor’s residence, with the tower straight ahead. The two vaulted chambers to the right are the basement of the knights’ hall; next to them is the chapel.
        
        
          8Getting There & Away
          
            Trails to Montfort can be picked up about 18km northeast of Nahariya, either from Goren Park, 9km east of the town of Shlomi (along Rte 899), or from a car park 3km northwest of Mi'ilya, a village that's about 16km east of Nahariya (along Rte 89). The hike to the castle from either trailhead takes about 45 minutes.

Lower Galilee & Sea of Galilee				


Why Go?
        
          Blessed with rugged hills cloaked in wildflowers in spring, ancient stone synagogues and archaeological sites from the early centuries of Christianity, the Lower Galilee – the part of northern Israel south of Rte 85 (linking Akko with the Sea of Galilee) – is hugely popular with hikers, cyclists, Jewish- and Arab-Israeli families on holiday, Tel Aviv epicureans and, of course, Christian pilgrims.
          Green, lush and chilly in winter (the perfect time for a hot-spring dip) and parched in summer (you can beat the heat in the Sea of Galilee), this is where Jesus of Nazareth lived, preached and is believed to have performed some of his most famous miracles. But these days even Nazareth is much more than a place of Christian pilgrimage – it now boasts one of Israel’s most sophisticated dining scenes. The shimmering Sea of Galilee (in Hebrew, the Kinneret), too, 
		  



juxtaposes holiday pleasures with archaeological sites linked to Jesus’s ministry.

      Nazareth

          Nazareth has come a long way since its days as a quiet Jewish village in Roman-ruled Galilee, so if you’re expecting bucolic rusticity be prepared for a surprise. These days, Israel’s largest Arab city is a bustling mini-metropolis with shop-lined thoroughfares, blaring car horns, traffic jams and young men with a penchant for showing off at the wheel. The Old City, its stone-paved alleys lined with crumbling Ottoman-era mansions, is in the process of reinventing itself as a sophisticated cultural and culinary destination.
          According to the New Testament, it was in Nazareth (al-Naasira in Arabic, Natzrat or Natzeret in Hebrew) that the Angel Gabriel appeared to Mary to inform her that she would conceive and give birth to the Son of God, an event known as the Annunciation (Luke 1:26-38).
          Like Capernaum, Nazareth and its residents were treated rather dismissively in the Gospels. The dis

dainful words of Nathanael of Cana, ‘Nazareth! Can anything good come from there?’ (John 1:46) are believed to reflect most Nazarenes’ lack of enthusiasm for their town’s most famous preacher.
          Everything in Nazareth is open for business on Shabbat (Friday night and Saturday). On Sunday, on the other hand, while attractions and pastry shops are open, stores and most restaurants are not.
        
        
          GET LOST
          
            You are going to get lost in the maze of alleyways that make up the Old City, so you may as well relax and enjoy! Complicating matters is the lack of street signs – though given that most street names are four-digit numbers, it should come as no surprise that locals don’t use them. On the brighter side, free colour maps of Nazareth are available at all of the Old City's guest houses.
          
        
      
      
        History
        
          In the 6th century, Christian interest in Nazareth was rekindled by reports of miracles, but a century later the Persian invasion brought massacres of Christians. 
After the arrival of Islam in 637 CE, many locals converted to Islam, but a significant Christian minority remained.
          The Crusaders made Nazareth their Galilean capital in 1099 but were driven out a century later by Saladin (Salah ad-Din). In the mid-1200s the Mamluk Sultan Baybars banned Christian clergy, and by the end of the century Nazareth was no more than an impoverished village.
          Churches were re-established in Nazareth in the 17th and 18th centuries. Napoleon Bonaparte briefly captured the town in 1799. By the end of the Ottoman period, Nazareth had a sizeable Christian community and a growing array of churches and monasteries (there are now about 30).
          Today about 30% of the population of Nazareth is Christian (the largest denominations are Greek Orthodox, Melkite Greek Catholic and Roman Catholic), down from about 60% in 1949. Tensions between Christians and Islamists occasionally flare up and have caused some Christians to leave the city.

              Dominating the Old City’s skyline is the lantern-topped cupola of this Franciscan-run Roman Catholic basilica, an audacious modernist structure that’s unlike any building you’ve ever seen. Constructed from 1960 to 1969, it’s believed by many Christians to stand on the site of Mary’s home, where many churches (but not the Greek Orthodox) believe the Annunciation took place.
            
            
              The Upper Basilica, its soaring dome shaped like an inverted lily, ‘glorifies Mary as the Mother of God’. With lovely mid-20th-century flair, the bare cast concrete is adorned with indented dots.
              In the dimly lit lower church, a sunken enclosure shelters the Grotto of the Annunciation, the traditional site of Mary’s house, and remnants of churches from the Byzantine (4th century) and Crusader (12th century) eras.
              The walls of the courtyard and the upper church are decorated with a series of vivid mosaic panels, donated by Catholic communities around the world, depicting Mary and the infant Jesus in styles that 
boldly reflect the cultures of their countries of origin. Panels from Ethiopia, Italy and France were added in 2013.

              Hidden away in an alleyway off the souq, this humble Crusader-era structure, now a Catholic church, stands on the site of the synagogue where it is believed that the young Jesus quoted Isaiah (61:1-2 and 58:6) and revealed himself as the fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophesy (Luke 4:15-30). The adjacent Greek Catholic Church (same hours), with its magnificent dome and two bell towers, was constructed in 1887 for the local Melkite Greek Catholic community.

              Built in the late 1700s by Sheikh Abdullah al-Fahum – his tomb can be seen through a glass door off the sanctuary – this mosque is known for its long-standing support of harmony between Nazareth’s different faith communities. You can leave your shoes on, except on the rugs. The office, to the right of the door, has scarves for women to cover their heads with, and information sheets in English.
            
            
              The interior and the courtyard, with a fountain for ablutions, are mostly modern. The colour white symbolises simplicity, purity, unity and peace.

              Almost across the street from the Basilica of the Annunciation, this stunning complex was built by Chemin Neuf, a Roman Catholic community based in France, as a venue for ecumenical work among Christians and for inter-religious dialogue. The peaceful rooftop gardens, landscaped with plants mentioned in the Bible, afford 360-degree panoramas, while in the basement there are in situ ruins from as far back as the First Temple period.

              Run by an ecumenical NGO, this re-creation of a 1st-century Galilean farmstead is great at helping visitors imagine Nazareth and its economic life in the time of Jesus. The wine press and vineyard terraces are authentically ancient, but everything else – the threshing floor, the burial cave, the olive press, the carpenter’s and weaver’s studios, the synagogue – are recreations that accurately portray 1st-century life. Crafts are demonstrated by actors and volunteers in period costume.

              Built between 1906 and 1923, this neo-Gothic church, with commanding views of Nazareth, has a clean, almost luminescent limestone interior whose delicate arches and soaring vaults can only be described as ‘very French’. It owes its name to the fact that Jesus spent much of his early life in Nazareth.
              
Located along the Jesus Trail, the church is inside École Jésus Adolescent, a school run by Catholic religious order the Salesians of Don Bosco. If possible, call ahead before visiting.
            
            
              The church is a steep, 20-minute walk from the Old City. From the gate to the parking lot, head left up the stairs and, at the top, enter the door to your right; the church is at the end of the hall. 
            
          
        
          THE JESUS TRAIL
          
            The 65km Jesus Trail (www.jesustrail.com) takes walkers from Nazareth’s Church of the Annunciation to Tabgha and Capernaum on the Sea of Galilee. Along the way, it passes through Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Bedouin and Druze communities and a gorgeously varied landscape: rugged hills, olive groves, forests and clifftop lookouts. Highlights include Christian holy sites, ancient synagogues, a Crusader-era battlefield and Nebi Shu’eib, the Druze religion’s most important shrine.
            Walking the entire trail, which is marked with orange blazes, usually takes four days, but shorter sections can be enjoyed as day hikes. Provided you have decent shoes and plenty of water, the route is suitable for all ages and abilities. Camping is an option, and there is plenty of accommodation along 
the way, ranging from B&Bs to top-end hotels. The itinerary and GPS waypoints are available on the excellent website, or you can purchase two first-rate guides: Hiking the Jesus Trail by Anna Dintaman and David Landis, and Jesus Trail and Jerusalem by Jacob Saar.

Eating & Drinking
        
          Connoisseurs around Israel and beyond know that Nazareth’s dining scene has become so drop-dead delicious in recent years that it’s worth staying the night (or weekend) for. The buzzword is ‘fusion’, with European-inspired dishes pimped with local seasonings and then served – with an extra helping of Arab hospitality – in atmospheric Old City mansions. Traditional Levantine specialities, tweaked for the Nazareth palate, are another highlight. Portions are copious.
          Also famous are Nazareth’s hummus joints, Oriental pastry shops, tahina (look for Al-Arz brand) and Kewar, the local arak (anise liqueur).
          Friday is Nazareth’s big night out so booking ahead is a good idea; restaurants may also be crowded on Thursday night and Saturday (lunch and dinner). Locals tend to eat late, often beginning dinner at 9pm or even 10pm. Wine, beer and spirits are widely available in Christian areas.
          Many of Nazareth’s trendiest spots for dining and sipping can be found at or around Church Sq, the focal point of the city's flourishing nightlife zone.

              The otherworldly aroma inside this spice emporium, run by the same family for four generations, has to be inhaled to be believed. Shelves, sacks, bins and bottles display more than 2500 products, from exotic spice mixtures (including Pierina’s Spice, based on a secret recipe passed down by owner Tony’s mother) to herbal teas, and from dried fruits to aromatic oils.

Kafr Kana
      %04
      
        
          About 8km northeast of central Nazareth on the road to Tiberias (and on the Jesus Trail), the Arab town of 
Kafr Kana (Cana) is believed to be the site of Jesus’s first miracle (John 2:1-11), when he changed water into wine at a wedding reception. About 10% of the population is Christian.
        
      
      
        1Sights
        
          Most of Kafr Kana's Christian sights are on or near stone-paved Churches St, which intersects the main road through town (Rte 754) at an oblique angle, at a point just north of a special parking lane on the eastern side of the street. The intersection is marked by a large white-on-black sign.

              This late-19th-century, green-domed Franciscan church stands on the site believed by Catholics to be that of Jesus's wedding miracle. In the basement is an ancient jar that may have been among the six used by Jesus when he turned water into wine. Under the church floor, through a glass tile, you can see an ancient Jewish inscription in Aramaic.

Tzipori

          Now one of Israel’s most impressive archaeological sites, Tzipori National Park (Zippori, Sepphoris; www.parks.org.il; adult/child 29/154NIS; h8am-5pm daylight-saving time, to 4pm winter time, closes 1hr earlier Fri, last entry 1hr before closing) was, in ancient times, a prosperous and well-endowed city with stone-paved roadways (rutted over time by wagons and chariots), an amazing water-supply system, a marketplace, bathhouses, synagogues, churches and a 4500-seat theatre. For many modern visitors, though, the star attraction is a mosaic portrait of a contemplative young woman nicknamed the Mona Lisa of the Galilee, one of several superb early-3rd-century mosaics discovered here in the 1980s.
          In the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE – a generation or two after the Bar Kochba Revolt (132 CE to 135 CE) against Rome – Tzipori was one of the most important centres of Jewish life in Israel. It was here that Rabbi Yehuda HaNassi is believed to have redacted the Mishnah (the earliest codification of Jewish law), and later on Tzipori scholars contributed to the Jerusalem (Palestinian) Talmud.

Mt Tabor Area  
      %04

        Mt Tabor
        
          You don’t have to be a Christian pilgrim to enjoy the beauty of Mt Tabor, the biblical site of the Transfiguration of Jesus (Matthew 17:1–9, Mark 9:2-8 and Luke 9:28–36), in which ‘his face became as dazzling as the sun; his clothes as radiant as light’ and

he spoke with the prophets Moses and Elijah. Two compounds crown the mountain, one Catholic (Franciscan), the other Greek Orthodox (closed to the public).
          According to the Hebrew Bible, Mt Tabor was where the Israelites, led by the prophetess Deborah, defeated a Canaanite army under the command of Sisera (Judges 4).
          The mountain was much contested during the Crusader period. The Benedictine monks of that era would have been astounded to hear that one day it would be used to launch hang-gliders.

Consecrated in 1924, it is decorated with lovely mosaics and has a crypt reached by 12 broad steps. Women are asked to dress modestly (no sleeveless shirts or miniskirts).

            Mt Tabor is about midway between Tiberias and Afula, just off Rte 65. From Rte 7266 – which goes all the way around the base of the mountain, connecting the Arab villages of Shibli and Daburiyeh with Rte 65 – it’s a teeth-clenching 3km ride (with 16 hairpin turns) up to the summit.

Known for its reds (merlot, cabernet sauvignon, shiraz, cabernet franc) and whites (chardonnay, sauvignon blanc, roussanne and gewurtztraminer), this well-regarded winery produces two million bottles a year. Offers free tastings and sales and, for groups of 10 or more, tours.
              
              
                From late July to August, the winery runs 1½-hour grape harvests (child/accompanying adult 30/20NIS; 10am Sunday to Friday) for children aged three and up. After using pruning shears and baskets to pick bunches of grapes, the kids stomp on them (yes, with their feet and yes, feet are washed first!) to turn them into juice, which they then bottle and take home. Reserve ahead.
              
            
          TrailsHIKING, CYCLING
              
                Kfar Tavor and nearby villages such as Kfar Kisch make a great base for hiking along the Israel National Trail and a spur of the Jesus Trail – for instance, northeast to the Yardenit baptism site on the Sea of Galilee or west up Mt Tabor. Sections of both trails are cyclable. For cyclists there’s also a single track through Beit Keshet Forest and some fine routes on the Sirrin Heights.


Kfar Kisch
        
          Surrounded by open fields where gazelles are a common sight, this moshav (cooperative settlement), 6km southeast of Kfar Tavor, is on both the Israel National Trail and a spur of the Jesus Trail.


Kfar Kama
        
          As the Russian Empire expanded southward in the mid-1800s, at least half a million Circassians (a Caucasian people of the Muslim faith) were forced out of their homes in the northern Caucasus – between the Black and Caspian Seas – and found refuge in the Ottoman lands. In 1876 some of them settled in Kfar Kama (population 3100), one of only two Circassian villages in Israel (the other is Rehaniya). The Circassian
sians have always enjoyed good relations with their Jewish neighbours, and all Circassian men – long famed as fierce warriors – are drafted into the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). Signs around the prosperous town are in Hebrew, Circassian (spoken at home and taught in school) and English.



WORTH A TRIPMT GILBOA
          
            The rugged, 18km-long ridge known as Mt Gilboa (highest point 536m), which runs along the southern edge of the Jezreel Valley, makes for a great nature getaway. After the winter rains (December to March or April), the area is carpeted with wildflowers, including the purple Gilboa iris (blooms in late February and early March). According to the Bible, this was where King Saul and his son Jonathan were slain in battle with the Philistines (1 Samuel 31:1-13).
            For a lovely hilltop drive with stupendous views of the Jezreel Valley (in the other direction, you can see the Palestinian villages around Jenin and, in the foreground, the Separation Fence between Israel and the West Bank), take 28km-long Rte 667 (Gilboa 

Scenic Rd), which links Rte 675 (8km southeast of Afula via Rte 71) with the Jordan Valley's Rte 90.
            For a hearty, country-style meal in a rustic setting, head to the family-run Herb Farm on Mt Gilboa (%04-653 1093; www.herb-farm.co.il; Rte 667; mains 67-135NIS; hnoon-10pm Mon-Sat; v), which has both meat dishes (eg Cornish hen) and good veggie and vegan options. It's a good idea to reserve ahead on Friday and Saturday. Situated on Rte 667 3.5km southeast of Rte 675; follow the yellow signs to 'Country Restaurant'.

          Stretching for about 45km from a bit west of Nazareth southeast to the Jordan River, the largely agricultural Jezreel Valley (also known as the Plain of Esdraelon) and the Beit She’an Valley, part of the Great Rift Valley, are bounded on the south by Mt Gilboa.
        
      
      
        Beit She’an
        
          Founded sometime in the 5th millennium BCE, Beit She’an – strategically situated at the intersection of the Jezreel Valley and the Jordan Valley – has the most extensive Roman-era ruins in Israel. It was levelled in the massive earthquake of 749 CE. The 

struggling modern town (population 17,200) has little to offer the visitor.
        
        
          REALLY, REALLY HOT
          
            The hottest temperature ever recorded anywhere in Asia, a sizzling 53.9°C (129°F), was registered at Kibbutz Tirat Tzvi (8km south of Beit She’an) on 21 June 1942.

                Beit She’an’s extraordinary Roman ruins are the best place in Israel to get a sense of what it was like to live, work and shop in the Roman Empire. Colonnaded streets, a 7000-seat theatre that looks much as it did 1800 years ago (the original public bathrooms are nearby), two bathhouses and huge stone columns that lie right where they fell during the 749 earthquake evoke the grandeur, self-confidence and decadence of Roman provincial life in the centuries after Jesus.
              
              
                The path to the theatre and the Cardo, the hugely impressive colonnaded main street, is wheelchair accessible.

Towering over the Roman city, known in Greek as Scythopolis, is Tel Beit She’an, created by at least 20 cities built and rebuilt one on top of the other. The viewpoint atop the tel offers near-aerial views of the Roman ruins.
                She’an Nights (Leilot She’an; %04-648 3639, 04-648 1122; adult/child 55/45NIS; hsundown Mon-Thu approximately Apr-Nov), an after-dark multimedia spectacular in English or Hebrew, brings alive the ruins with projected images but is not a satisfactory substitute for a daylight visit – it's too dark to read the signs and most of the site is off-limits. The show is cancelled if it rains. Call ahead for reservations.
                To get to the park entrance, head down the hill for a few hundred metres from the Bank Leumi branch at 81 Sha'ul HaMelech St.

Belvoir
        
          Set on a hilltop 550m above the Jordan River, this Crusader fortress (%04-658 1766; www.parks.org.il; adult/child 22/10NIS; h8am-5pm Apr-Sep, to 4pm Oct-Mar, closes 1hr earlier Fri, last entry 1hr before closing), measuring an impressive 110m by 110m, consists of concentric ramparts, gates, courtyards and towers that afford spectacular views of the Jordan and Jezreel Valleys and Jordan’s Gilead Mountains. Highlights include a dining room topped by a Gothic vault, a huge stone cistern and, along the western side, a deep dry moat. It's noticeably cooler up here than in the valley below. There's excellent signage in English and Hebrew.
          Built by the Knights Hospitaller starting in 1168, Belvoir (‘beautiful view’ in French; the Hebrew name, Kochav HaYarden, means ‘star of the Jordan’; the Arabic name, Kawkab al-Hawa, means 'star of the wind') was forced to surrender to Muslim forces in 1189 after a 1½-year siege. The defenders were permitted to retreat to Tyre unharmed, in acknowledgment of their courage.
          The panoramic, 1.2km-long Wingate Trail, outlined with rocks, goes along the slope below the 
ruins. Posted maps explain what you're seeing on both sides of the border, including details on local plate tectonics and the route of the pre-1948 oil pipeline from Kirkuk (Iraq) to Haifa.
          Next to the ruins stands a sculpture garden of works – made of cut-out steel plates – by the award-winning Israeli artist Yigal (Igael) Tumarkin (b 1933), creator of the Holocaust memorial at Tel Aviv's Rabin Sq.
          Belvoir is 20km north of Beit She'an and 20km south of the Sea of Galilee, 6km off Rte 90 along a one-lane road.
        
      
      
        Beit Alpha Synagogue
        
          No one was more surprised than the members of Kibbutz Heftzibah when they went out to dig an irrigation channel in 1928 and uncovered a stunning, Byzantine-era (6th-century) mosaic floor. Further excavation revealed the rest of the Beit Alpha Synagogue, whose extraordinarily mosaics are among the most evocative of ages past ever found in Israel.
          The three mosaic panels depict traditional Jewish symbols such as a Torah ark, two menorahs (seven-branched candelabras) and a shofar (ram’s horn) alongside a spectacular, 12-panel zodiac circle, a pagan element if there ever was one. At the bottom,

          THE MONGOLS WERE HERE
          
            The year was 1260, the place very near present-day Kibbutz Ein Harod. The belligerents were the mighty Mongol empire and the Egyptian Mamluks. In a cataclysmic clash known to history as the Battle of Ein Jalut, the Mongols were decisively and enduringly defeated for the first time in their history, bringing their expansion into the Middle East to a screeching halt.

SOCIALIST PASSIONS
          
            Life at Kibbutz Ein Harod, midway between Afula and Beit She’an (about 14km from each), carried on in relative tranquillity from its founding in 1921 until the very early 1950s. That was when an ideological dispute over Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion’s strategic preference for the capitalist United States over the socialist Soviet Union flared into a full-fledged ideological conflagration. Complicating matters was the fact that, at the time, Stalin was staging anti-Semitic show trials in which prominent Jews were being accused of trumped-up counter-revolutionary crimes and then executed. Stalin’s devotees at the kibbutz, who were of the ‘you can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs’ school of hard-line socialism, stood by their man.
            Passions flared – these were, after all, people who lived by their socialist ideals – and soon barricades went up in the dining hall, good friends stopped speaking to each other, fisticuffs were exchanged and couples broke up. Finally, Ein Harod split into two separate kibbutzim, Ein Harod Meuchad, run by the Stalin loyalists, and Ein Harod Ichud, under the control of the Ben-Gurionists (both meuchad and ichud mean ‘united’).
            Resentments smouldered for decades, and even today some old-old-timers are angry about their rivals’ craven betrayal. It was only 25 years ago that the first ‘mixed’ Ichud-Meuchad couple tied the knot, and just 15 years ago that agricultural and cultural cooperation between the two kibbutzim resumed. Today, Kibbutz Ein Harod Ichud – whose souces of income include wheat, cotton, milk cows and the production of ultra-advanced miniature cryocoolers – is still a traditional ‘collective’ kibbutz,

      Tiberias
      %04  /  Pop 41,700
      
        
          Tiberias is one of the four holy cities of Judaism, the burial place of venerated sages, and a very popular base for Christians visiting holy sites around the Sea of Galilee. It's also one of the most aesthetically challenged resort towns in Israel, its sunbaked lakeside strip marred by 1970s architectural monstrosities. So, not for the first time, the sacred and the kitsch – plus beaches and hot springs – coexist side by side in a whirl of holiness, hawkers and hedonism.
          If you’ve got a car, the Golan, the Galilee panhandle, Beit She’an, Nazareth and even Akko are an hour or less away. Tiberias is often oppressively hot in July and August.
History
        
          Tiberias’ 17 hot springs have been luring pleasure seekers since well before 20 CE, when Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great, founded the town and named it in honour of the Roman emperor Tiberias (r 14–37 CE).
          After the Judeans' disastrous Bar Kochba Revolt (132–135 CE), Tiberias became one of the most important centres of Jewish life in Israel, playing a key role in the redefinition of Judaism after Temple sacrifices in Jerusalem were halted by the Roman victory of 70 CE. Some of the greatest post–Second Temple sages, including Yehuda HaNassi, chief editor of the Mishnah, lived here, and much of the redacting of the Jerusalem (Palestinian) Talmud also seems to have taken place in Tiberias. From the late 2nd century, the Sanhedrin (ancient Israel’s supreme court) was based in the town. The system still used today to indicate vowel sounds in written Hebrew was developed in – and named after – Tiberias.
          The Crusaders took Tiberias in 1099, building a massive fortress a bit north of the town’s Roman-Byzantine centre. In 1187 Saladin captured the town and shortly thereafter devastated Crusader forces at the Horns of Hattin, 8km due west of Tiberias.
          In 1558 the newly arrived Ottomans granted tax-collecting rights in the Tiberias area to Dona Gracia (www.donagraciaproject.org), a Lisbon-born Conversa (outwardly Catholic but secretly Jewish) woman who had found refuge from the Inquisition in Istanbul.
In the early 1700s a Bedouin sheikh named Daher al-Omar established an independent fiefdom in the Galilee, with Tiberias as its capital, and invited Jewish families to settle in the town. By the end of the Ottoman period, Jews constituted the great majority of Tiberias’ 6500 residents.
          Tiberias was almost completely demolished in the great earthquake of 1837.

          THE RED LINE
          
            Israelis follow the water level of the Sea of Galilee – in newspapers, on the radio and on TV – at least as closely as they do stock-market indexes. As winter rains flow into the lake, news reports follow its progress towards full capacity (208.8m below sea level), while in summertime, the lake’s descent towards (and sometimes even below) the ‘red line’ (213m below sea level) – beyond which pumping may adversely impact water quality – generates news flashes and, at times, screaming, doom-laden headlines. If not for the desalinisation plants along the Mediterranean coast that have come on line in recent years, the condition of the Sea of Galilee would be severely compromised.
            To find out the current state of the lake, stop by the Water Level Surveyor (

          Tombs of Jewish Sages
          
            Many of Tiberias' Jewish visitors are drawn to the city at least partly by the desire to pray – and ask for divine intercession – at graves believed to belong to some of Judaism's most eminent sages. If you were assembling an all-star team of the most influential Jewish thinkers of all time, the four rabbis mentioned below would certainly be on it.
          
          Tomb of Rabbi Meir Ba’al HaNessRELIGIOUS SITE(h6am-10pm or later Sun-Thu, in summer/winter to 5/3pm Fri)
              
                A complex of religious buildings has grown around the reputed burial place of Rabbi Meir Ba'al HaNess, a 2nd-century sage often cited in the Mishnah (ba'al ha-ness means 'master of miracles'). The tomb itself, with separate, curtained entrances for men and women, is inside a domed Sephardi synagogue, situated just down the slope from its Ashkenazi counterpart, topped with a taller dome. The complex is 2.5km south of the city centre, 200m up an asphalt road from Hamat Tveriya National Park.
              
              
                Behind the Sephardi section, market stalls sell holy amulets, including specially blessed olive oil and arak.
                Rabbi Meir's hilula (a celebration held by Hasidim on the anniversary of a sage's death) is just three days before that of Shimon Bar Yochai, who's buried 
at Mt Meron, so some pious Jews travel to the Galilee to take in both hugely popular events.

The nearby Maimonides Heritage Center (www.mhcny.org; h10am-3pm Sun-Thu) has exhibits on the sage's life and writings.
              
              
                The Rambam's most famous works are the Mishneh Torah, the first systematic codification of Jewish law; Guide to the Perplexed, a work of theology, written in Arabic, that is still hugely influential today; and various books on medicine (he served as the personal physician of the sultan of Egypt, where he spent the last decades of his life).

Rabbi Akiva, a leading Mishnaic sage (and teacher of Rabbi Meir Ba'al HaNess), played a major role in establishing rabbinic (ie post–Second Temple) Judaism. He was tortured to death by the Romans because of his support for the Bar Kochba Revolt – indeed, his enthusiasm for resistance to the Romans was such that he declared Bar Kochba to be the Messiah. What is believed to be his dome-topped tomb is on the hillside about 1.5km west of the town centre.

Back in Roman times the fame of Tiberias’ hot springs was such that in 110 CE the Emperor Trajan struck a coin dedicated to them – it depicted Hygeia, the goddess of health, sitting on a rock and enjoying the waters. Today, you can get a sense of Roman-era Tiberias at this grassy hillside park, whose star attraction is a 4th-century synagogue decorated with a beautiful zodiac wheel mosaic.

CYCLING
The Sea of Galilee is great cycling territory. Completely circumnavigating the lake (60km) takes about six hours – for about 70% of the way you can follow the Kinneret Trail (Shvil Sovev Kinneret), but the rest (including from Ein Gev on the east coast to Arik Bridge at the Sea of Galilee's northern tip) has to be done on highways for now.
For a nice half-day ride from Tiberias, you can head 8km south to Yardenit, from where an 8km circuit follows the Jordan River.
Start early to beat the heat and take plenty of water. When riding on roads, make sure you’re highly visible and stay on the verge (shoulder), as far as possible from traffic. Do not ride after sundown.
Aviv Hostel Bike Rental ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %04-672 0007; 66 HaGalil St; per day 70NIS; h7am or

AROUND THE LAKE BY BUS
          
            On Friday and Saturday in July and daily during much of August, the free Kav Sovev Kinneret bus (%*55477; www.kineret.org.il) circumnavigates the Sea of Galilee – stopping at every beach – every two hours from 10am to 8pm. Check the website (in Hebrew) for exact dates.



MODEST DRESS
        
          The Christian sites along the Sea of Galilee’s northern shore require that visitors dress modestly (no tank tops or shorts above the knee).
        
      
    
    
      Sea of Galilee
      
        The shores of the Sea of Galilee (in Hebrew, Yam Kinneret or HaKinneret), by far Israel’s largest freshwater lake, are lined with great places to relax: beaches, camping grounds, cycling trails and walking tracks.
        Jesus is said to have spent most of his ministry around the Sea of Galilee. This is where he is believed to have performed some of his best-known miracles (the multiplication of the loaves and fishes, walking on water), and it was overlooking the Kinneret that he delivered the Sermon on the Mount.
        The Jordan River flows into the Sea of Galilee near the ruins of the ancient city of Bethsaida, providing three-quarters of the lake's annual intake. It exits the lake, on its way to the Dead Sea, next to the Yardenit baptism site, at the lake’s far southern tip.

SEA OF GALILEE BEACHES
        
          Environmental organisations and local authorities have been waging a successful legal battle to claw beachfront land around the Sea of Galilee – which by law belongs to the public – back from the clutches of private operators. Beaches offering special facilities – lifeguards, security, changing rooms, showers, lawns, chairs, water slides and the like – are still authorised to charge, either per-person admission or per-car parking fees. In the latter case, access to the beach is free if you come on foot, though non-paying guests aren't allowed to take advantage of the amenities.
          Admission to pay beaches, many open 24 hours a day, usually costs either 20NIS to 30NIS per person or, if fees are for parking, 5.90NIS per hour for the first three hours and 2.10NIS per hour after that. Beaches north of Tiberias include Tamar and the lake's first 'green beach', Hukuk. South of town, there's municipal Hof Ganim (1.5km south of the centre) as well as Sironit, Shikmim, Berniki, Tzinbari (Zinabberay) and Tzemah. Along the eastern shore, beaches include (from north to south) Dugit, Tze'elon (Zelon), Kursi, Lavnun, Halukim, Susita, Shittim, Shezaf and Rotem.
          In addition, there are plenty of free, unguarded stretches of coastline just off Rtes 90, 87 and 92, though these may be specked with rubbish and even glass shards. Winds can be surprisingly strong, especially in the afternoon, so make sure you don't get blown out to sea.
          Camping is permitted at almost all Sea of Galilee beaches, including those that charge fees.
North of Tiberias
        
          As you drive, cycle or walk north from Tiberias, Hwy 90 and the parallel Kinneret Trail (Shvil Sovev Kinneret) curve around the northwestern shore of the lake, passing some of Israel’s most significant New Testament sites.
          The places in this section are listed from southwest to northeast.

                Winter Weekend takes place on a Friday night and Saturday in early December. The Spring Festival is staged over a long weekend (Thursday to Saturday) in early May.
1Sights
          Arbel National ParkNATIONAL PARK(%04-673 2904; www.parks.org.il; adult/child 22/10NIS; h8am-5pm daylight-saving time, 8am-4pm winter, closes 1hr earlier Fri)
              
                Towering over the Sea of Galilee and offering mesmerising views of the Golan Heights and Mt Hermon, Arbel Cliff is 181m above sea level, making it 390m above the vast blue lake below. It is on both the Israel National Trail and the Jesus Trail, and hikes of various lengths are possible within the park.
                The park is 11.5km northwest of Tiberias; take Rte 77, Rte 7717 and then the Moshav Arbel access road, from where a side road leads northeast for 3.5km.
              
              
                For great views, you can walk to the Carob Tree Lookout (30 minutes return) and, a few minutes further along the ridge, the Kinneret Lookout. A three-hour circuit that requires some cliff clambering with cables and hand-holds takes you past the Cave Fortress, apparently built by a Druze chieftain in the 1600s. It’s also possible to do a circuit (five to six hours) that heads down to the Arbel Spring and then back up to park HQ via the ruins of a 6th-century synagogue – the latter is 800m towards Moshav Arbel along the park’s sole access road.
                In 1187 Saladin inflicted a devastating defeat on the Crusaders at the Horns of Hattin, the ridge a few kilometres west of Arbel Cliff.
              
            
          MagdalaARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE
(%04-620 0099; www.magdalacenter.com; Migdal Junction, Rte 90; admission 10NIS; h9am-6pm daily)
              
                When the Legionnaires of Christ, a Catholic congregation based in Mexico, began to build a spiritual retreat in 2009, they were astonished to discover a synagogue from the 1st century CE, dated to the time of Jesus by a local coin minted in 29 CE. The ongoing excavations were opened to the public as an open-air museum in 2014. Situated 6km north of Tiberias on the site of the ancient town of Magdala (Migdal in Hebrew), home of Mary Magdalene.
              
              
                Inside the synagogue archaeologists found the Magdala Stone, a rectangular altar – discovered facing south towards Jerusalem – decorated with a seven-branched menorah that is unique because it was carved when the Temple in Jerusalem was still standing. The altar may have been used to read the Torah. The original is at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem; here you can see a copy.
                Visitors can also see the elegant Spirituality Center and its five mosaic-adorned chapels, one financed by Catholics from Singapore. Volunteers conduct free tours in English, Spanish and French.
              
            
          oAncient Galilee BoatHISTORIC SITE(Jesus Boat; %04-672 7700; www.bet-alon.co.il; Kibbutz Ginosar, Rte 90; adult/child 20/15NIS; h8am-5pm Sun-Thu, to 4pm Fri, to 5pm Sat; W)
              
                In 1986, when the level of the Sea of Galilee was particularly low, a local fisherman made an extraordinary discovery: the remains of a wooden boat later determined to have plied these waters in the time of 
Jesus’s ministry. The 8.2m fishing vessel, made of 12 kinds of (apparently recycled) wood, can be seen inside Kibbutz Ginosar’s Yigal Alon Centre. Wall panels and three short films tell the fascinating story of its discovery and preservation (so does the website).
              
              
                Another part of the complex houses a museum (open Sunday to Thursday) dedicated to the settlement of the Galilee by early Zionist pioneers. There’s a viewing platform with fine views up on the 5th floor. Outside, the lovely shoreline site is surrounded by expanses of waving reeds and a garden of sculptures by Jewish and Arab artists. The museum has a cafeteria.
              
            
          TabghaCHURCH
              
                Two Catholic churches a few hundred metres apart occupy the stretch of Sea of Galilee lakefront known as Tabgha (an Arabic corruption of the Greek hepta pega, meaning ‘seven springs’). An attractive walkway links Tabgha with Capernaum, a distance of about 3km.
              
              
                The austere, German Benedictine Church of the Multiplication of the Loaves & Fishes (www.heilig-land-verein.de; h8am-5pm daily), built in 1982, stands on the site of a 5th-century Byzantine church whose beautiful mosaic floor, depicting flora and feathered fauna, can still be seen. (Original tiles are in vivid colours; repaired sections are in shades of grey.) The rock under the altar is believed by some to be the ‘solitary place’ where Jesus is said to have laid the five loaves and two fishes that multiplied to feed 
5000 faithful listeners (Mark 6:30-44). Excellent brochures (1NIS) are available along one wall. The church is wheelchair accessible.
                A few hundred metres to the east, a shady, fragrant garden leads down to the water’s edge and the Franciscan Church of the Primacy of St Peter (h8am-4.50pm), a chapel – lit by the vivid colours of abstract stained glass – built in 1933. The flat rock in front of the altar was known to Byzantine pilgrims as Mensa Christi (Christ’s Table) because it was believed that Jesus and his disciples breakfasted on fish here (John 21:9). On the side of the church facing the lake, a few steps cut out of the rock are said by some to be where Jesus stood when his disciples saw him. (On the other hand, the steps may have been cut in the 2nd or 3rd century, when the area was quarried for limestone.) Just west of the church, a path leads to three serene outdoor chapels surrounded by the reeds and trees that grow along the lakeshore.
              
            
          oMount of the BeatitudesCHURCH(Har HaOsher; %04-671 1225; Rte 90; per car 10NIS; h8-11.45am & 2-4.45pm)
              
                This breathtaking hillside Roman Catholic church, built in 1937, stands on a site believed since at least the 4th century to be where Jesus delivered his Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7), whose opening lines – the eight Beatitudes – begin with the phrase ‘Blessed are…’. The sermon also includes the Lord’s Prayer and oft-quoted phrases such as ‘salt of the 
earth’, ‘light of the world’ and ‘judge not, lest ye be judged’.
              
              
                Inside the octagonal church, looked after by Franciscan nuns, the Beatitudes are commemorated in stained glass just below the dome, while the seven virtues (justice, charity, prudence, faith, fortitude, hope and temperance) are represented around the altar. The balcony and tranquil gardens have breathtaking views of the Sea of Galilee.
                Monte delle Beatitudini (as it’s known in Italian), situated on the Jesus Trail, is a 3.1km drive up the hill from Tabgha’s Church of the Multiplication of the Loaves & Fishes. Walking is also an option – from just outside the mount’s entrance booth, a 1km path leads down the hill to Tabgha, hitting Rte 87 at a point about 200m east of the Church of the Primacy of St Peter.
              
            
          CapernaumARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE(Kfar Nachum, Kfar Nahum; admission 3NIS; h8am-5pm, last entry 4.30pm)
              
                The New Testament relates that the prosperous lakeside village of Capernaum (estimated population 1500), on the imperial highway from Tiberias to Damascus, was Jesus’s base during the most influential period of his Galilean ministry (Matthew 4:13, Mark 2:1, John 6:59). It is mentioned by name 16 times: this is where Jesus is believed to have preached at the synagogue (Mark 1:21), healed the sick and recruited his first disciples, fishers Peter, 
Andrew, James and John, and Matthew the tax collector.
              
              
                The Franciscan friars who run the site, dressed in brown cassocks with a white rope around the waist, are happy to answer questions. An explanatory sheet is available at the ticket window.
                Capernaum’s renowned synagogue, whose facade faces south towards Jerusalem, consists of two superimposed structures. The reconstructed building that can be seen today, known as the ‘White Synagogue’ because it’s made of light-coloured limestone, was built in the late 4th century atop the dark basalt foundations of the ‘Synagogue of Jesus’, which – despite its name – appears to have been built at least a century after the Crucifixion.
                On the other side of the tree-shaded benches from the synagogue, 10m to the right of the olive press, a menorah decorates the upper lip of a column. A nearby column bears a 5th-century inscription in Hebrew commemorating a donation made by someone named Alpheus, son of Zebidah.
                A modern, glass-walled church (1991), used for hourly Masses in a variety of languages, is dramatically suspended over the ruins of an octagonal, 5th-century church that partly obscures St Peter’s House, where Jesus is believed to have stayed.
                At the entrance to the site, along the fence to the right of the statue of St Peter, is a row of impressive stone lintels decorated with fruit and plant motifs but, in accordance with the Third Commandment (Exodus 20:4), no images of people or animals.
Capernaum is 16km northeast of Tiberias and 3km northeast of Tabgha. Hwy 87 has three signs indicating turn-offs to Capernaum – to get to the archaeological site, take the westernmost of the three.
              
            
          Monastery of the Twelve ApostlesCHURCH(h9am-about 5pm, to about 6pm daylight-saving time)
              
                Peacocks strut around the serene, deeply shaded lakefront garden of this Greek Orthodox site, 200m as the crow flies (1.6km on foot or by car) northeast of the Capernaum synagogue, at the eastern edge of the ancient city. The chapel-sized church, its distinctive red domes visible from afar (including from the Mount of the Beatitudes), dates from 1925, but the whole complex – from the grape trellises to the rich interior iconography (redone for the millennium) – casts a very Byzantine spell.
              
              
                To get there, follow the signs to 'Capernaum (Orthodox)'.
              
            
          Korazim National ParkARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE(Rte 8277; adult/child 22/10NIS; h8am-5pm daylight-saving time, to 4pm rest of year, closes 1hr earlier Fri, last entry 1hr before closing)
              
                On a hillside overlooking the Sea of Galilee, Korazim is a good place to get an idea of the layout of a prosperous, midsized Galilean town in the time of Jesus and of the Talmud (3rd to 5th centuries CE). The site – especially the synagogue – is known for its extraordinary basalt carvings, which depict floral and geometric designs – permitted by Jewish law – 
as well as Hellenistic-style representations of animals, humans (eg people stomping on grapes) and mythological figures (Medusa!).
              
              
                Two extraordinary objects were found inside the synagogue: a richly decorated column thought to have held up the table used to read the Torah; and an armchair bearing an inscription in Aramaic. The originals are now in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem (in situ you can see replicas). The people of Korazim – along with the inhabitants of Capernaum and Bethsaida – were denounced by Jesus for their lack of faith (Matthew 11:20-24).
                Korazim is on Rte 8277, 2.5km east of Rte 90 (Korazim junction, i.e. Vered HaGalil), and 8km west of the ruins of Bethsaida (in Park HaYarden). There is no public transport.
              
            
          BethsaidaARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE(Beit Tzayda; %04-692 3422; www.parkyarden.co.il; Rte 888 just north of Rte 87; per car 60NIS; hlast entry 5pm)
              
                These excavations, inside HaYarden Park Nature Reserve (Jordan River Park), are believed to be those of the ancient fishing village of Bethsaida, where Jesus is said to have fed 5000 people with just five loaves of bread and two fish (Luke 9:10-17), walked on water (Mark 6:45-51) and healed a blind man (Mark 8:22-26) – and where he also issued a stern rebuke to the town (Luke 10:13-15). 
              
              
                Two walking circuits are trail marked in black: a 500m route around the basalt ruins, which don’t look like much to the untrained eye (signs help visitors imagine the original structures), and a 1km route 
down to the spring and back. The site is surrounded by pre-1967 Syrian trenches and minefields.
                The Bethsaida Excavations Project (http://world.unomaha.edu/bethsaida), which accepts volunteers for its summer digs, is based at the University of Nebraska in Omaha.
                Bethsaida is in the far northeastern corner of the Sea of Galilee, about 6km from Capernaum. In ancient times the lake, now 2km away, probably came up to the base of the tel.

          KINNERET TRAIL
          
            Part of an energetic campaign by environmentalists to ensure unrestricted, fee-free public access to the entirety of the Sea of Galilee shoreline, this trail – known in Hebrew as the Shvil Sovev Kinneret – will eventually make it possible to walk all the way around the lake, a distance of about 60km. For now, about 35km – including the southern half of the lake, from Tiberias to Ein Gev, and the northeastern coast – are trail marked (with purple and white blazes) and ready for use. The Tiberias tourist office can supply you with a map and updates.

          THE JEZREEL VALLEY RAILWAY
          
            From shortly before WWI until 1951, you could hop on the legendarily slow Jezreel Valley Railway in Haifa at 8am and pull into Hamat Gader at 11.45am – or, until 1946, arrive in Damascus at 7.47pm. Or you could transfer to the Hejaz Railway in the Syrian town of Daraa, 60km east of Hamat Gader, and roll south. (Daraa is where the first confrontations of the Syrian civil war took place in 2011.) Until the Hejaz Railway was knocked out of commission during WWI by Lawrence of Arabia and his Bedouin fighters, you could take the train all the way to Medina, now in Saudi Arabia.
            In the 1930s, the Jezreel Valley Railway helped transport construction materials for the 942km Kirkuk–Haifa Pipeline that, until 1948, carried crude oil from Iraq to the refineries of Haifa Bay. Remains 
of the pipeline can still be seen on the Golan Heights. Regional peace would make rebuilding the pipeline very attractive both economically and strategically – and turn Haifa into the major Mediterranean port the British intended it to be.
            Proposals to place the Jezreel Valley Railway back into service have been mooted for decades, but the construction of a 4.5-billion-NIS standard-gauge line (the Ottoman tracks were narrow gauge) from Haifa to Beit She’an (61km) is finally under way. At a later stage, there are plans to extend the line to Irbid, Jordan, allowing the Hashemite Kingdom to take advantage of Haifa’s Mediterranean port facilities.
            For details on cycling the 150km route of the original Jezreel Valley Railway, pick up a copy of the guidebook Shvil Rakevet HaEmeq by Aharon Brindt (in Hebrew).

          Kinneret CemeteryCEMETERY(Rte 90; h24hr)
              
                Shaded and serene, this luxuriantly green lakeside cemetery, established in 1911, is the final resting place of socialist Zionist pioneers such as Berl Katznelson (1887–1944), famous for being at the centre of a celebrated love triangle (his grave is flanked by those of his first and second wives), and Shmuel Yavnieli (1884–1961), who worked to bring Yemenite Jews to Israel. It is 9km south of Tiberias and 300m south of Kinneret Junction.
              
              
                Also buried here is the Hebrew poet Rachel (Rachel Bluwstein; 1890–1931); books of her hugely 
popular poems – many of which have been set to music – can be found in a stainless-steel container attached to her grave. She appears on the Bank of Israel's new 20NIS banknote, released in late 2014.
                In the spring of 1917 the Ottomans expelled the entire Jewish population of Tel Aviv and Jaffa. Of the 2000 refugees who fled to the Galilee, 430 died and 10 are buried here, commemorated by 10 anonymous gravestones and a stone plaque, erected in 2003, bearing their names.

                This hugely popular, eucalyptus-shaded baptism site, run by Kibbutz Kinneret, is 100m south of where the Jordan River flows out of the Sea of Galilee. No one knows if this is the exact spot where Jesus was baptised, but groups of Christian pilgrims line up here – praying and singing – to be baptised in white robes (rental/purchase US$10/25, including towel and certificate). Changing rooms are provided.
              
              
                Those furry rodents paddling around the fish-filled Jordan are nutrias (coypus), natives of South America. The site has a restaurant and a large religious-souvenir shop.
                Yardenit is 10km south of Tiberias and 1km northwest of Kibbutz Degania Alef, the world’s first-ever kibbutz (founded in 1910).
              
            
          Bet GabrielBUILDING(%04-675 1175; www.betgabriel.co.il; Rte 92; hclosed Sun)
Opened in 1993, this lakeside cultural centre – one of Israel’s most beautiful buildings – is known for its art exhibitions, first-run cinema (two screens), cafe and truly spectacular sea views. In November 1994 it served as the venue for a ceremony reconfirming the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan. Situated at the southern tip of the Sea of Galilee, 300m east of Tzemah Junction.
              
              
                King Hussein’s red-and-white keffiyeh and a sword given to Shimon Peres by Yasser Arafat can be seen in the Peace Room (free tours 10-11.30am Tue; call ahead), whose mirrors ensured that everyone, no matter where around the six-sided, eight-seat table they sat, could see the Sea of Galilee.

                Located in the northeastern corner of the Sea of Galilee, the spring-fed streams and jungle-like wetlands of this reserve are ideal for a refreshing ‘water hike’. The wet circuit (there’s also a dry one) takes 40 to 

60 minutes; be prepared for water that’s up to hip height (60cm deep in summer). The lagoons near the lake are off-limits, to allow fish and water turtles to breed.
              
              
                Changing rooms are available; bring shoes suitable for walking in water. Some trails are wheelchair accessible. Situated 2km off Rte 92; follow the signs to 'Daliyyot Estuary' or 'Bethsaida Valley'.

                Mentioned in the Talmud as a place of idol worship, this Gentile fishing village – discovered by chance in the early 1970s – is where Jesus is believed to have cast a contingent of demon spirits out of two men and into a herd of swine (Mark 5:1-13, Luke 8:26-39). The beautifully conserved ruins feature an impressive 5th-century Byzantine monastery.
              
              
                Near the entrance, an audioguide gadget with buttons for English and Hebrew provides excellent historical background. The site should be fully wheelchair accessible by the end of 2015. This is considered a Christian holy site, so dress modestly (no bathing suits). Situated 30km from Tiberias if you go around the southern side of the Sea of Galilee and 33km if you take the highway along the northern side.

Religious Sites
    
      Modern-day travellers can visit places of monumental importance to the three great Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Both believers and the merely curious often find themselves surprised, inspired and moved by these time-honoured sites.
    
    
Via Dolorosa
      
        Threading through Jerusalem’s Old City, the ‘Way of Sorrows’ follows the path that Jesus, bearing the cross, is believed to have taken on the way to Calvary. The 14 Stations of the Cross commemorate important events along the way.


Dome of the Rock
      
        Topped by a shimmering golden dome, this 7th-century Islamic shrine stands atop the massive stone from which the Prophet Mohammed is believed to have ascended to Heaven during his Night Journey.

Western Wall
      
        Many visit Judaism’s holiest site to press their hands against the wall and stuff a prayer into the cracks between the stones.

Mount of Olives
      
        Jews come to the Mount of Olives to visit the world’s oldest Jewish cemetery, while Christian pilgrims are drawn here by dome- and mosaic-adorned churches and the 2000-year-old olive trees of the Garden of Gethsemane.

Jericho
      
        Possibly the world’s oldest city, Jericho is best known in the Bible as the place where Joshua’s trumpets brought down the walls and Jesus was both tempted by the Devil and baptised by John the Baptist.
      
    
    
      Church of the Holy Sepulchre
      
        Incense, candles, icons and the hushed prayers of pilgrims set the mood inside Christianity’s holiest site, believed since at least the 4th century to be the site of Jesus’s crucifixion, burial and resurrection.
      
      

Mt Zion
      
        A single structure on Mt Zion is believed to shelter both the Room of the Last Supper, one of Christianity’s holiest sites, and King David’s Tomb, sacred to Jews.
      
    
    
      Tomb of the Patriarchs
      
        According to both Genesis and the Quran, Abraham and his family are buried in the highly contested Tomb of the Patriarchs, the Holy Land’s second-most-sacred site for both Muslims and Jews.

Ashkenazi Ari Synagogue, Tsfat
      
        This ancient synagogue stands on the spot where the great 16th-century Kabbalist Yizhak Luria (aka the Ari) used to greet the Shabbat.
      
    
    
      Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem
      
        Duck through the low stone entrance, intended to inspire humility, and make your way down to the traditional site of Jesus’s manger, marked by a silver star with 14 points.

Tabgha
      
        Situated on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, Tabgha is where Jesus is believed to have miraculously multiplied five loaves of bread and two fishes to feed a congregation of 5000.

Why Go?
        
          The rolling, green hills of the Upper Galilee (the area north of Rte 85) and the wild plateaus and peaks of the Golan Heights offer an incredible variety of 
		  
		  
		  
		  
activities to challenge the body and the soul and to nourish the stomach and the mind. Domestic tourists flock to the area – some are looking for luxurious tzimmerim (B&Bs), boutique wineries and gourmet country restaurants, while others come in search of superb hiking, cycling and horse riding, white-water rafting and even skiing. The region has still more attractions, including dazzling carpets of spring wildflowers, some of the world’s best birdwatching and the spiritual charms of Tsfat, the most important centre of Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) for over five centuries. The entire region, its summits refreshingly cool in summer, is just a short drive from the Christian sites and refreshing beaches of the Sea of Galilee.
        
      
    
    
      When to Go

The Upper Galilee
Tsfat (Safed)
%04 / Pop 32,100
The mountaintop city of Tsfat is an ethereal place to get lost for a day or two. A centre of Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) since the 16th century, it’s home to an otherworldly mixture of Hasidic Jews, artists and devout-but-mellow former hippies, a surprising number of them American immigrants.
In the old city’s labyrinth of cobbled alleys and steep stone stairways, you’ll come across ancient synagogues, crumbling stone houses with turquoise doorways, art galleries, artists’ studios and Yiddish-speaking little boys in black kaftans and bowler hats. Parts of Tsfat look like a shtetl (ghetto) built of Jerusalem stone, but the presence of so many mystics and spiritual seekers creates a distinctly bohemian atmosphere.
On Shabbat (Friday night and Saturday until sundown), commerce completely shuts down. While this may be inconvenient if you’re looking for a bite to eat, the lack of traffic creates a meditative, spiritual atmosphere through which joyful Hasidic tunes waft from hidden synagogues and unseen dining rooms. Do not photograph observant Jews on Shabbat and holidays.

In July and August and during the Passover and Sukkot holidays, Tsfat is packed with tourists – both Israeli and foreign – and the city’s restaurants and cafes buzz until late at night. Winter, on the other hand, is very quiet, giving the city’s many artists a chance to get some work done.
          
        
        
          LOST ON THE WAY TO ETERNITY
          
            If you ask a local for directions, explaining that you’re lost, you may be told: ‘You’re not lost, you’re in Tsfat!’ Providing details on where you’re going is likely to elicit the desired directions – the locals, though otherworldly in their spiritual yearnings, are generally a friendly and helpful lot (and many are native English speakers).
            Even the geographically gifted visitor is almost sure to get lost in the old city’s tangle of alleyways. Most have names (or at least Hebrew-letter designations), but signs are few and far between and, in any case, few locals use – or even know – the official street names. Making matters worse is the fact that street numbers, where they exist, are not always sequential. Oh, and the signs pointing the way to 
various landmarks are designed to provide directions for drivers, not pedestrians.
          
        
        
          History
          
            Founded in the Roman period, Tsfat was fortified by Yosef ben Matityahu (later known as Josephus Flavius), commander of Jewish forces in the Galilee in the early years of the Great Jewish Revolt (66–70 CE). According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Tsfat was the site of one of the hilltop fire beacons used to convey news of the sighting of the new moon in Jerusalem.
            The Crusaders, led by King Fulk of Anjou, built a vast citadel here to control the highway to Damascus. It was later captured by Saladin (1188), dismantled by the Ayyubids (1220), rebuilt by the Knights Templar (1240) and expanded by the Mamluk Sultan Beybars (after 1266).
            During the late 15th and 16th centuries, Tsfat’s Jewish community increased in size and importance thanks to an influx of Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. Among the new arrivals were some of the Jewish world’s pre-eminent Kabbalists. During this period, Tsfat was an important stop on the trade route from Akko to Damascus and was known for its production of textiles. A Hebrew printing press – the first such device anywhere in the Middle East – was set up in Tsfat in 1577.
            In the late 1700s, Tsfat welcomed an influx of Hasidim from Russia.
Tsfat was decimated by the plague in 1742, 1812 and 1847, and devastated by earthquakes in 1759 and 1837. The latter disaster killed thousands and caused all but a handful of buildings to crumble.
            In 1948 the departing British handed the town’s strategic assets over to Arab forces, but after a pitched battle Jewish forces prevailed and the Arab population fled – among them, 13-year-old Mahmoud Abbas, now president of the Palestinian Authority. These days, Tsfat’s residents include more than a few American Jews who turned to mysticism in a 1960s-inspired search for spirituality and transcendental meaning.


1Sights
          
            Central Tsfat's main thoroughfare, lined with shops and eateries, is north–south Yerushalayim St (Jerusalem St). West of here, a broad staircase called Ma'alot Olei HaGardom divides the Synagogue Quarter (to the north) from the Artists' Quarter (to the south). The main alley in the Synagogue Quarter, famous for its many art galleries, is called Alkabetz 
St and Beit Yosef St (Yosef Caro St). The Kabbalists' tombs are further down the slope.
          
          
            Most of Tsfat’s sights are in the Synagogue Quarter and the adjacent Artists’ Quarter.
          
          
            TSFAT’S GALLERY SCENE
            
              A retreat and inspiration for Israeli artists since the 1950s, Tsfat is home to one of Israel’s largest collections of artists’ studios and art galleries, making it the best place in the country (along with Jerusalem) to shop for Judaica (Jewish ritual objects). You’ll find jaw-dropping original art, commercial semi-kitsch and everything in between, and almost all the works – menorahs, mezuzahs, illuminated Hebrew manuscripts, jewellery, glasswork, sinuous modern sculpture, paintings – are imaginative and upliftingly colourful. Most, in the mystical Hasidic tradition, are also joyous.
              In the Synagogue Quarter, dozens of galleries can be found along Alkabetz St, a stone-paved alleyway that stretches south from the Ashkenazi Ari Synagogue; further south it is known as Beit Yosef St 
(Yosef Caro St). More galleries, as well as artists’ studios, are hidden away in the Artists’ Quarter along the alleys around the General Exhibition, including Tet-Vav St.
              The galleries mentioned below are listed from north to south.

            Synagogue Quarter
            
              Tsfat’s long-time Jewish neighbourhood spills down the hillside from HaMaginim Sq (Kikar HaMaginim; Defenders’ Sq), which dates from 1777; all of Tsfat’s historic Kabbalist synagogues are a quick (if often confusing) walk from here. If you’re short on time, the two to visit are the Ashkenazi Ari and Caro synagogues. Galleries filled with exuberant art line the main alleyway, known as Alkabetz St and Beit Yosef St.
              Synagogue hours tend to be irregular, especially in winter, and unannounced closings (eg for Monday and Thursday morning bar mitzvahs) are common. Visitors should wear modest clothing (no shorts or bare shoulders); kippas/yarmulkes are provided for men (or you can wear any hat). Caretakers appreciate a small donation (5NIS). Synagogues are closed to tourists on Shabbat and Jewish holidays.

                  Founded in the 16th century by Sephardic Jews from Greece, this synagogue was destroyed in the 1837 earthquake and rebuilt in the 1850s. It stands on the site where the great Kabbalist Yitzhak Luria (Isaac Luria; 1534–72; often known by the name Ari) used to greet the Sabbath. In the 18th century it came to 
serve Tsfat’s Ashkenazi Hasidic community, hence the synagogue's name (the Jerusalem-born Ari had a Sephardic mother and an Ashkenazi father).
                
                
                  High atop the 19th-century holy ark (where the Torah scrolls are kept), carved and elaborately painted according to the traditions of Galicia (Poland), the lion has a human-like face that worshippers speculate may be that of the Ari (the Hebrew word ari means ‘lion’).
                  In 1948, the synagogue was packed with worshippers when an Arab mortar round slammed into the courtyard, sending shrapnel crashing into the side of the bimah (central platform) facing the door (the hole is still there). It was a miracle, say locals, that there were no casualties.

                  Named (like the street it’s on) in honour of the author of the Shulchan Aruch (the most authoritative codification of Jewish law), Toledo-born Rabbi Yosef Caro (1488–1575), this synagogue was founded as a house of study in the 1500s but rebuilt after the earthquakes of 1759 and 1837 – and again in 1903. To the right as you face the ark, hanging in one of the windows, you can see the twisted remains of a Katyusha rocket from Lebanon that landed just outside in 2006.
                
                
                  In the 16th century, Caro, the head of Tsfat’s rabbinical court, was the most respected rabbinical 
authority not only in Palestine but in many parts of the Jewish Diaspora as well. According to tradition, an angel revealed the secrets of Kabbalah to Caro in the house below the synagogue.

The ornately carved courtyard, restored in the late 20th century, is often used for weddings.
                
                
                  Inside, the four central pillars represent the four elements (earth, air, water and fire) that, according to Kabbalists (and ancient Greeks such as Aristotle), make up all of creation. The oval dome has 10 windows, one for each of the Ten Commandments; representations of the 12 Tribes of Israel; illustrations of musical instruments used in the Temple; pomegranates (said to have the same number of seeds as there are Jewish commandments, 613); and the Dome of the Rock, a reminder of the Temple in Jerusalem.

                  Tsfat’s oldest synagogue – it's mentioned in documents from as far back as 1522 – was frequented by the Ari, who found inspiration in the panoramic 
views of Mt Meron and the tomb of Shimon bar Yochai. To the left of the raised bimah (platform) is the small room, glowing with candles, where he is said to have studied mystical texts with the prophet Elijah. The present structure is partly the result of rebuilding after the earthquake of 1837.

Run by the same family for six generations, this small dairy takes about 50,000L of sheep’s milk a year and turns it into delicious cheeses, including soft, creamy Bulgarian cheese (aged for a full year) and a variety of gvina Tzfatit (Tsfat-style cheese; aged for six months) that’s harder, saltier and sheepier than the supermarket variety – both can be purchased at the tiny deli counter. To get there, go all the way to the bottom of the Ma'alot Olei HaGardom staircase, turn right and walk 50m.
                
                
                  There are 45-minute tours (adult/child 20/15NIS, in Hebrew) at noon on Friday; a cafe is planned. Cheeses are made each Thursday.

                  Run by the Kadosh family for seven generations, this microdairy produces minuscule quantities of deliciously sharp, salty gvina Tzfatit as well as a variety of other cheeses, including blue cheese, kashkaval (a semihard yellow sheep’s milk cheese) and pecorino. You can usually watch cheese being made on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday from 8am to 3pm. To get there from the Synagogue Quarter, follow the signs down the hill to ‘Safed Cheeze’ or 'Zefat Cheeze'.
                
                
                  The dairy sells cheeses, as well as halva made with honey, stuffed grape leaves and local wines. A sampler plate with about 10 cheeses and bread – enough for a meal – costs 40NIS.
MA'ALOT OLEI HAGARDOM
            
              Leading southwest from the Mandate-era police station on Yerushalayim St, this broad, arrow-straight stairway was built by the British in the late 1930s to serve as a buffer between the Arab community (living mainly in what’s now the Artists’ Quarter) and the Jewish community (in the Synagogue Quarter). Much of the rioting of 1929 took place on what is now Tarpat St, which is about halfway down the hill.
              From the top of the staircase, look at the rooftop directly across Yerushalayim St and you’ll see an old British fortification, still topped by a searchlight. At the bottom, the Yehezkel HaMeiri Viewpoint (

            Artists’ Quarter
            
              The neighbourhood south of the Ma’alot Olei HaGardom stairway used to be Tsfat’s Arab quarter, as you can see from the minarets, but after the 1948 war the area was developed as an Israeli artists’ colony. To help things along, the government declared that any artist who was willing to live in Tsfat for at least 180 days a year would be given a free house and gallery.
              In the ‘50s and ‘60s, some of the country’s most celebrated painters (Moshe Castel, Yitzhak Frenkel, Simcha Holtzman, Arieh Merzer and Menahem Shemi), inspired by Tsfat’s stunning landscapes and mystical traditions, opened studios and held exhibitions in the town. Art-lovers escaped the heat of Tel 
Aviv and spent their summers holidaying in the city’s two dozen hotels.
              Most of the galleries and studios around the quarter are open to visitors, with many artists happy to talk about their work and even happier to make a sale.

            Ancient Jewish Cemetery
            
              The weed-covered, rock-strewn jumble of sun-baked graves below the Synagogue Quarter doesn’t look like much, but for followers of Jewish mysticism, the spirits of the great 16th-century Kabbalists buried here make this hillside an exceptional place to connect with the divine spark through prayer and meditation.
              A wander through the area is a bit otherworldly at any time, but it’s particularly magical in the early evening, when you can walk in the flickering glow of 
memorial candles, often to the haunting echoes of chanted prayers and psalms.
              Anyone who was remotely famous has had their stones painted ‘Tsfat blue’, a light hue that reminds passers-by that the Kabbalists’ spiritual role is to connect the heavens and the earth.
              To avoid impure thoughts among the pious men who come to pray in Tsfat’s ancient Jewish cemetery, Hebrew signs direct women to separate walkways and platforms. But it’s not always clear where you’re supposed to go, and even strictly Orthodox people often ignore the contradictory signage, which is part of a growing trend among some ultra-Orthodox groups to separate the sexes to a degree unprecedented in Jewish history.
              If you can’t read Hebrew, all you need to know to keep the signs straight is that the word for ‘women’ (nashim, written) includes the letter Shin, which looks like a three-branched candelabra.
              As at any holy site, visitors should dress modestly.

Once used by the Ari, the site is run by the Breslov (Bratzlav) Hassidic movement.

                  The graves of many of Tsfat’s greatest sages and Kabbalists are about one-third of the way down the slope, just below a solitary pine tree in an area where the converging double walkways are covered with transparent roofing. If you can’t read Hebrew, ask passers-by for help in finding the tombs of Yitzhak Luria (Isaac Luria; born in Jerusalem in 1534, died in Tsfat in 1572), aka HaAri, the father of modern Jewish mysticism (Lurianic Kabbalah).
                
                
                  Near the tomb of Luria is that of Shlomo Alkabetz (born in Thessalonika c 1500, died in Tsfat in 1580), best known for composing the hymn ‘Lecha Dodi’. Yosef Caro (born in Toledo in 1488, died in Tsfat in 1575), the most important codifier of Jewish law, is buried about 100m further down the hill.

Mt Meron Area
        
          West of Tsfat, antenna-topped Mt Meron (1204m), Israel’s second-tallest peak (after Mt Hermon), looms over the Dalton Plateau and scattered Jewish, Druze and Arab villages. Until recently, the area was planted with deciduous fruit trees such as pear and apple, but more and more land is being given over to grapevines for the thriving wineries of Ramat Dalton, sometimes called (with some exaggeration) the ‘Israeli Napa Valley’ or ‘Israel’s Tuscany’.

Set on the southeastern slopes of the Mt Meron massif, the moshav is known for its clean air (no chicken coops or cow sheds), excellent organic food and rustic guesthouses – a beautiful place to bliss out.

              Amirim is a quiet settlement of single-family homes with a few artists’ galleries, a sculpture park in the centre of the moshav, and a swimming pool (open 
approximately mid-June to mid-September) situated in an enchanting canyon. Trails lead into the nearby Mt Meron Nature Reserve. Everything is well signposted.
              Many locals are as passionate about alternative medicine as they are about vegetarianism, and yoga teachers, shiatsu practitioners and naturopaths abound – for details, see http://amirim.com/health/en.



Jish
          
            The only village in Israel with a Maronite (Eastern Catholic) majority, serene hillside Jish (population 3000) was settled by migrants from Lebanon in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today it is the site of a pioneering effort to revive the use of Aramaic, the language of Jesus and an important source of identity for Maronites. Most shops are closed on Sunday.

During the Great Jewish Revolt (66–70 BCE), Jish – then, as now, known in Hebrew as Gush Halav – was the last place in the Galilee to fall to the Romans, according to Josephus Flavius.
          
          
            1Sights & Activities
            
              Near the entrance to the village, you can visit a large, modern Maronite church and, across the street, the tombs of Shamaiya and Avtalion, Jewish sages who served on the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem during the 1st century BCE. In a small valley 800m east of the entrance to Jish, hikers can explore the remains of an ancient synagogue (3rd or 4th century CE) amid gorgeous fig and olive groves.
              A paved, 2.5km hiking and cycling path known as the Coexistence Trail (wheelchair accessible) heads east from Jish, leading to Moshav Dalton via Dalton Reservoir.
              At local farms you can pick your own cherries (May), peaches (starting in June), raspberries (summer) and apples (late August to October).

Ramat Dalton
          
            The area around Moshav Dalton, known as Ramat Dalton (Dalton Plateau), produces some highly regarded wines. Several wineries do their thing in the Ramat Dalton Industrial Park, 4km northeast of Jish on Rte 886.

Tomb of the Rashbi
          
            Authorship of the Zohar, the most important work of Kabbalah, is traditionally credited to the 2nd century CE Jewish sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, who is often known by his acronym, the Rashbi (Rashby). Scholars believe the work was compiled in Spain in the 13th century. By tradition, the tomb of the Rashbi (Rte 866; h24hr) is 5km northwest of Tsfat on the slopes on Mt Meron, somewhere under a rigorously sex-segregated complex (men to the left, women to the right) that appears to date, in part, from the Crusader period. Since his precise burial place is unknown, there is no actual tomb, just a tziun (marker) – inside a multialcove synagogue – 
above which candles flicker behind smoke-darkened glass.
            Other important sages who are believed by some to be buried in the immediate vicinity include the Rashbi’s son Rabbi Elazar; the renowned 1st-century BCE sage Hillel the Elder, who summed up Judaism with the single commandment ‘What is hateful to thee, do not unto thy fellow man’; and Hillel’s great rival in legal disputations, Shammai.
            On the eve of the holiday of Lag BaOmer, tens of thousands of mostly haredi pilgrims flock to the tomb of the Rashbi, spending the whole night in fervent prayer, with singing and dancing around bonfires. Some pilgrims perform a ceremony known as Upsherin in Yiddish and Halaaka in Judeo-Arabic, at which three-year-old boys are given their first haircuts.
            The Rashbi’s blue-domed grave complex, situated inside the Orthodox Moshav Meron (gate locked from sundown on Shabbat and Jewish holidays), is run rather chaotically by squabbling haredi groups. Adding to the hair-trigger atmosphere is the fact that the complex serves as a place of refuge for homeless people (some with psychiatric issues) and criminals recently released from prison. To get to the tomb you may have to run a gauntlet of beggars. Non-Jews, as well as anyone who’s not modestly dressed or who arrives on Shabbat, may encounter hostility, as did Madonna, who had rocks thrown at her.

                Perched on an isolated hilltop, artsy, rustic Bikta BeKadita – inspired by the American back-to-nature movement of the 1960s – has an ecological philosophy and a hippy vibe. It's situated 4.5km northeast of Meron Jct, 1km off Rte 89 along a one-lane gravel road.
              
              
                The five eclectic and very creative cabins, surrounded by fruit orchards, are built of sustainable materials; each has room for two to four people and comes with – what else? – a hammock. Hosts Doron and Mika serve lavish homemade breakfasts and wine from Kadita’s own vineyard, which produces just 500 bottles a year. 

WINERY TOURS
            
              Israeli wines are attracting growing attention on the world wine scene – and winning top international awards. Among those that are kosher, the best are those that are not mevushal (flash pasteurised), a process that can degrade a wine’s delicate flavours and aromas.
              Israel now has some 300 wineries of all sizes, including about 30 on the Golan, with its well-drained volcanic soils, cool breezes and varied elevations and microclimates; 90 in the Upper Galilee; 30 in the Western Galilee; 30 in the Lower Galilee and on Mt Carmel; 70 in the Judean Hills; and 30 in the deserts of the Negev.

                Rosh Pina’s old town was settled in the 1870s by Jews from Tsfat and after 1882 by immigrants from Romania. It consists of just three short cobblestone streets, one of them, with Parisian pretension, called HaBoulevard. It has been turned into a pedestrian zone, and visitors can explore the quiet lanes, lined with pretty, restored (and unrestored) stone houses, visit the old synagogue and pop into about a dozen galleries selling jewellery, ceramics and paintings. 

In Professor Mer’s House (1887) there’s a small museum with exhibits on Rosh Pina’s early years.

              At this spot, archaeologists have uncovered no fewer than 21 layers of settlement from the 3rd millennium BCE to 732 BCE, when the Israelite city that stood here – whose 10th-century BCE gate may have been built by Solomon – was destroyed by the Assyrians. In times of siege, the supply of water was ensured by an extraordinary underground system whose 40m-deep shaft is accessible via a spiral staircase. Excavations are ongoing and signage is excellent. Tel 
Hatzor has been a Unesco World Heritage site since 2005.

              Migrating birds flock to the wetlands of Israel’s first nature reserve, founded in 1964. More than 200 species of small waterfowl mingle happily with cormorants, herons, pelicans, raptors, storks and cranes, while water buffalo (jamoose) roam certain areas of the reserve, their grazing important to the preservation of open meadows. The main 1.5km Swamp Trail, which passes birdwatching hides, is wheelchair accessible. Situated 15km north of Rosh Pina, at a point 2km west of Rte 90.
            
            
              The visitors centre offers an excellent, 40-minute 3D film (available in English) on bird migration and 
informative dioramas on Hula wildlife. In the shallow lake, you may spot fur, shells and fins in addition to feathers – these will be attached to nutrias, otters, swamp turtles or catfish weighting up to 20kg. Unlike the rest of Israel, the Hula is at its greenest in the summer. Around sunset in the winter, you can see birds returning from their daytime feeding. Renting binoculars costs 10NIS.

            Kiryat Shmona is a sunbaked, hardscrabble ‘development town’ with little to offer the visitor except the promise of transport from the faded, grungy bus station. The town is almost completely shut on Shabbat.
            The name, which means ‘Town of the Eight’, honours eight Zionist pioneers, including Josef Trumpeldor, killed in 1920 at Tel Hai, 3km to the north.

WARNING: ROCKETS
          
            While the Northern Galilee is peacefully bucolic most of the time, it still occasionally comes under fire from Katyusha rockets launched from southern Lebanon, either by Hezbollah or radical jihadi groups. First fielded by the Soviet Union during WWII (thus the name, which is the diminutive form of Yekaterina, ie Catherine), these notoriously inaccurate weapons take a mere 30 to 40 seconds from launch to impact. If air raid sirens go off, quickly get inside a building or lie on the ground.

            Situated at the Galilee’s northernmost tip, this picturesque, hilltop village – surrounded on three sides by Lebanon – was founded in 1896 with help from the French branch of the Rothschild family. In 1920 its location played a crucial role in the decision to include the Galilee Panhandle in the British Mandate of Palestine rather than the French Mandate of Lebanon. Today, the economy is based on tourists in the mood for a Swiss alpine vibe and on fruit orchards growing apples, pears, peaches, nectarines, apricots, kiwifruit and lychees.
1Sights & Activities

To the south you can see the Hula Valley, to the east the Golan (including Mt Hermon and the twin volcanoes of Avital and Bental) and to the north the fields and hills of Lebanon. Inside Israel's northern neighbour, you can see the Ayoun Valley in the foreground, while on the horizon it’s easy to spot the Beaufort, a Crusader fortress.

                This 50-hectare reserve, 1.6km north of Rte 99, boasts two major attractions. The first, an area of lush forests, is fed by year-round springs that normally gush 8 cu metres of water per second into the Dan River, the most important tributary of the Jordan. The second is the remains of a grand ancient city inhabited by the Canaanites in the 18th century BCE and the Israelites during the First Temple period (from the 12th century BCE).
              
              
                You can explore the reserve on three trails, parts of which are virtual tunnels through thick brambles and undergrowth: the Short Trail (40 minutes), the Long Trail (1½ hours) and the Ancient Dan Trail (two hours); significant sections are wheelchair accessible. All pass a 40cm-deep wading pool, a great place to cool your feet (swimming is prohibited elsewhere in the reserve).

Because the reserve is a meeting place of three ecosystems, it supports a surprisingly varied selection of flora and fauna, including the Indian crested porcupine and the endangered fire salamander, a speckled orange and black critter with five toes on its back feet but only four on its front feet. Some of the reserve’s non-native tree species, including eucalyptus (gum) and silver poplar, have been cut to make room for native species.
                The Tel Dan Stele, found by an archaeology team from Hebrew Union College in 1993, is a fragment of a 9th-century BCE tablet in which the king of Damascus boasts (in Aramaic) of having defeated the ‘king of Israel’ and the king of the ‘House of David’. This is the earliest known reference to King David from a source outside the Bible. The original is at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

                This first-rate regional museum, run by the SPNI, has two sections. In the old-fashioned but informative (and, in its own way, beautiful) natural history room, you can get a close-up look at (stuffed) butterflies, birds and mammals that you’re not likely to encounter in the wild. The archaeology section focuses on nearby Tel Dan and includes a copy of the Tel Dan Stele. The museum is situated just east of Kibbutz Dan, 800m north of Rte 99 and 300m off the access road to Tel Dan Nature Reserve.
The museum screens a 17-minute film on the area in eight languages. The 940km Israel National Trail, which goes all the way to the Red Sea, begins in the parking lot. The Syrian tank on the nearby lawn was knocked out by kibbutz members at the beginning of the 1967 Six Day War.

DON'T MISSRAFTING THE JORDAN
        
          First-time visitors may be surprised at the Jordan’s creek-size proportions, but first-time rafters are often bowled over – sometimes into the soup – by how powerful its flow can be. The wildest bit of the river, a 13km stretch known as the Yarden Harari (Mountainous Jordan), runs from B’not Ya’akov Bridge (on Rte 91) to Karkom (about 6km north of Rte 87’s Arik Bridge, near the Sea of Galilee). The season begins as soon as the river's springtime flow isn't so powerful that it's dangerous.
          All the outfits we list have changing rooms (bring a bathing suit) and lockers for valuables (10NIS or 20NIS); some places will hold your car keys and mobile phone for no charge. Unless you’re told otherwise, assume that you’ll get either wet or drenched.
          Discounts of 20% or more are often available on the internet if you book at least 24 hours ahead, or from locally distributed coupon books. A dry winter caused some companies to cancel their 2014 season – call for details on weather and river conditions.

      The Golan Heights
      
        Offering commanding views of the Sea of Galilee and the Hula Valley, the volcanic Golan plateau is 
dry and tan in the summer, and lush, green and carpeted with wildflowers in the spring. Its fields of basalt boulders – and, on its western edge, deep canyons – are mixed with cattle ranches, orchards, vineyards and small, middle-class communities. The area is a favourite destination for holidaying Israelis. Accommodation – mostly B&Bs – tends to cost more than in the Galilee; prices are highest from June to August and on Jewish holidays.
        Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Six Day War, when 90% of the inhabitants fled. In the bitterly fought 1973 Yom Kippur War, Syrian forces briefly took over much of the Golan before being pushed back; a 1974 armistice set the current ceasefire lines. All around the Golan – unilaterally annexed by Israel in 1981 – you’ll see evidence of these conflicts: abandoned Syrian bunkers along the pre-1967 front lines; old tanks, left as memorials, near the battlefields of 1973; and ready-for-action Israeli bunkers facing the disengagement zone, staffed by the blue-helmeted soldiers of the UN Disengagement Observer Force troops (Undof).
      
      
        MINEFIELDS
        
          Some parts of the Golan Heights – particularly those near the pre-1967 border and the 1974 armistice lines – are still sown with antipersonnel mines.

            The lively little commercial centre, Merkaz Eitan, is a classic 1970s complex that was spruced up considerably in 2013 – adding a tile-covered sculpture that is as whimsical as it is colourful. In addition to a bank and some eateries, it has a first-rate museum. Everything closes on Shabbat.

Yehudiya Nature Reserve
          
            One of the most popular hiking areas in all of northern Israel, the 66-sq-km Yehudiya Nature Reserve (%Meshushim entrance 04-682 0238, Yehudiya entrance 04-696 2817; adult/child 22/10NIS; h7am-4pm or 5pm Sat-Thu, 7am-3pm or 4pm Fri) offers walks suitable for casual strollers as well as experienced hikers, especially those who aren’t averse to getting wet. Mammals you might encounter include gazelles and wild boar; its cliffs are home to birds of prey as well as songbirds.
            Most of the trails follow three cliff-lined wadis, with year-round water flow, that drain into the northeastern corner of the Sea of Galilee. Wadi Yehudiya and Wadi Zavitan are both easiest to access from the Yehudiya Parking Lot (Chenyon Yehudiya), which is on Rte 87 midway between Katzrin and the Sea of Galilee.
            Wadi Meshushim, easiest to get to from the Meshushim Parking Lot, is situated 2.8km along a gravel road from Rte 888, which parallels the Jordan River. The parking lot is 8km northeast of the New Testament site of Bethsaida.
            The rangers at both entrances to Yehudiya (pronounced 'yeh-hoo-dee-yah') are extremely knowledgeable and can point you in the right direction, as well as register you, for your own safety. The only map you’ll need is the excellent colour-coded one provided at ticket booths. At both entrances, snack counters sell sandwiches and ice cream.
Stick to marked trails – people have fallen to their deaths while attempting to negotiate treacherous makeshift trails, and there’s an army firing zone east of Wadi Yehudiya (across Rte 87).

                  One section of the New Upper Yehudiya Canyon Trail involves 20 to 40 minutes of walking in water 50cm to 1m deep. A variant is the Yehudiya Waterfall Trail (red blazes; 45 minutes one-way from park HQ).
                
              
            Upper Zavitan Canyon TrailHIKING
                
                  This three-hour circuit offers great views of 27m-high Zavitan Waterfall, spectacular in the rainy season. The descent begins at the ruins of the Arab village of Sheikh Hussein, northeast of the Yehudiya Parking Lot. An easy trail with blue, then black, then red, then blue blazes, the path heads downstream to 
link with the Lower Zavitan Canyon Trail and, eventually, Meshushim (Hexagons) Pool. 
                
                
                  If you begin hiking after 11am, don’t plan on making it all the way to the pool.
                  Branches of the Upper Zavitan Canyon Trail can be picked up near Katzrin and on Rte 9088 between Katzrin and Katzrin Darom Junction.
                
              
            Meshushim (Hexagons) PoolHIKING
                
                  Surrounded by extraordinary, six-sided basalt pillars (thus the name), this chilly (19°C), 7m-deep pool makes for a refreshing dip. Getting there from the Meshushim Parking Lot, which has changing rooms, requires a delightful, 20-minute downhill walk; getting back up takes 30 to 40 minutes. The Stream Trail (Shvil HaNahal), which hits Wadi Meshushim further upstream (and has a 3m cliff ladder), takes 20 to 30 minutes downhill. 
                
                
                  Begin these routes before 2pm (3pm during daylight savings).
                  At the pool, remember that there is no lifeguard – and jumping and diving are absolutely forbidden (people have died here from hitting their heads).
                  It’s possible to hike down to Meshushim Pool from the Yehudiya Parking Lot (four to six hours, depending on your route) but transiting from Wadi Zavitan to Wadi Meshushim involves a steep ascent and then an equally steep descent; and getting back up to your car (assuming you have one and parked it at Yehudiya) could be a problem. This route cannot be started, in either direction, after 11am.

HIKING MAPS & SAFETY
          
            The Golan’s most visited nature reserves issue excellent trail maps when you pay your admission fee, but if you’ll be hiking further afield, the map to get – if only to avoid minefields and firing zones – is the Hebrew-only SPNI Map 1, a 1:50,000-scale topographical trail map which covers Mt Hermon, the Golan and the Galilee Panhandle (ie the Hula Valley and surrounds). It is sold at most of the area's national parks.
            In nature reserves with entry fees, up-to-the-minute details on trail conditions are available at information counters. For certain routes you’ll be asked to register, possibly by leaving a card on your dashboard so if rangers find your car after dark they’ll know where to send the rescue teams.
            Other safety tips:
            
              ABring plenty of water.
              AWear a hat and sturdy shoes.
              ANever dive into the pools of water often found at the base of waterfalls (every year people are killed when they hit underwater boulders).
              AMake sure you get back by nightfall.
            
          
        
        
          Gamla Nature Reserve
          
            The site of a thriving Jewish village during the late Second Temple period, Gamla – perched atop a rocky ridge shaped like a camel’s back (gamla is the Aramaic word for camel) – dared to defy the Romans during the Great Jewish Revolt (66–70 CE) and as a result was besieged by Vespasian’s legions. In 67 CE, historian Josephus Flavius recorded the seven-

month siege, the defenders’ valiant stand and the bloody final battle, and reported a Masada-like mass suicide of thousands of Jews. After the town was identified in 1968 based on Josephus’ precise descriptions, excavations unearthed an enormous quantity of Roman siege weaponry (some can be seen in Katzrin’s Golan Archaeological Museum) as well as one of the world’s oldest synagogues, believed to date from the 1st century BCE (ie from the time of the Second Temple). Walking down to, and around, ancient Gamla takes two to three hours.
            Gamla is known for the dozens of Griffon vultures (wingspan: an astonishing 2.7m) that nest in the reserve's cliffs and soar majestically over the valley below. Sadly, they are becoming rarer, victims of high-voltage electrical lines and poisoned carrion that ranchers set out – illegally – to kill wolves and jackals. Half-hour guided walks (in Hebrew) begin daily at 11am and 1pm at the Vulture Lookout.
            Israel’s highest perennial waterfall, which drops 51m to a pool, can be seen from the Waterfall Overlook (Tatzpit HaMapal); the trail (1½ hours return) passes a field dotted with dolmens (basalt grave markers) erected by nomads 4000 years ago.
            On the plateau around the parking lot, the Vulture Path (Shvil HaNesharim; 20 to 30 minutes) affords a fine panorama of the ancient city. It was made wheelchair accessible in 2014.
            Gamla is 20km south of Katzrin, to which it's linked by Rama buses 10, 11 and 17.
Ani’am Artists Village
          
            This quiet moshav, 9km southeast of Katzrin (and about 1km off Rte 808), is home to eight attractive ateliers and galleries arrayed along a brick-paved pedestrian street. The artists – including two ceramicists and a New York–born goldsmith, Joel Friedman of Golan Gold, who makes exquisite braided gold jewellery – are happy to tell visitors about their crafts. Most places are open Sunday to Thursday from 11am to 4pm or 5pm (7pm or later in August); Friday and Saturday hours tend to be 10am to about 3pm (4pm in summer).
            Ani'am has two kosher restaurants that are closed on Friday night and Saturday.
          
        
      
      
        North of Katzrin
        
          The north-central Golan includes several nature reserves and the twin volcanoes of Avital and Bental, which tower over the UN disengagement zone. In 2014 artillery shells and rockets from Syria landed in the area, leading to periodic closures of parts of Rte 98.
        
        
          Ein Zivan
          
            Kibbutz Ein Zivan, 19km northeast of Katzrin, was the first kibbutz in the country to undergo privatisation, starting in 1992.

          SYRIAN CIVIL WAR SPILLOVER
          
            In 2014 Syrian opposition groups took control of the Syrian side of the frontier, holding a group of Fijian UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) soldiers hostage. In a not-unrelated development, a number of shells and rockets landed on the Israeli side of the disengagement lines. Check into local security conditions before you venture near the border, especially around Mt Bental and the Quneitra Viewpoint.
Quneitra Viewpoint
          
            From high atop Mt Avital, top-secret IDF electronics peer deep into Syria, but the Quneitra Viewpoint, on the volcano’s lower flanks, also affords fine views into Israel’s troubled northern neighbour. The site – at which an 'audio explanation station' describes the battles fought here in 1973 – overlooks the ruined town of Quneitra, one-time Syrian 'capital of the Golan', just 2km away.
            At the end of the Six Day War, Quneitra, at the time a garrison town defending Damascus (60km to the northeast), was abandoned in chaos by the Syrian army after Syrian government radio mistakenly reported that the town had fallen. It changed hands twice during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, which Israel began with just 177 tanks against the attacking Syrians’ 1500. Inside the UN buffer zone since 1974, Quneitra was captured by Syrian rebel forces in mid-2014.
            Just beyond the apple orchards and vineyards of Kibbutz Ein Zivan, you can see the only crossing between the Golan and Syria, run by the UN and – until the civil war – used by Golan Druze students and brides heading to Syria to study and/or get married (the subject of the 2004 Israeli film The Syrian Bride) and by Druze-grown Golan apples being trucked to Syria.
            A path leads down the slope from the viewpoint to the Avital Volcanic Park (HaPark HavVolkani; h10am-4pm daily), situated in an old quarry whose excavations exposed many layers of the Golan's 
eventful geological history. Signs are in Hebrew, Arabic and English.
            The viewpoint and park are next to a small parking lot on the eastern side of Rte 98, 1.3km north of Zivan Jct.
          
          
            PICK YOUR OWN FRUIT
            
              The Golan Heights is Israel’s most important deciduous-fruit-growing region. From about May to September or October, several orchards open their gates to visitors in the mood to pick their own (katif atzmi). There’s generally an admission fee (around 25NIS) that allows you to eat as much fruit as you like while you pick; you pay per kilo for what you want to take home. Some sites have other attractions for kids, including animals. Ask locals to find out what’s in season.

From old Israeli trenches and bunkers, ready to be used at a moment's notice, you can see the Hula Valley, Lebanon, Mt Hermon, Syria and nearby Mt Avital, sprouting IDF antennas. The clearest views of the Quneitra area are just before sunset; recent visitors have reported hearing distant gunfire from Syria's civil war. Two 'audio explanation stations' provide historical information in Hebrew and English. Signposts show the way to Damascus (60km), Haifa (85km), Amman (135km), Jerusalem (240km), Baghdad (800km) and Washington, DC (11,800km).

          The area along and north of Rte 99 includes some superb nature reserves and towering Mt Hermon, which has four Druze villages on its southern slopes.
          Tel Dan Nature Reserve is just 5km west of Banias Nature Reserve.
        
        
          Banias Nature Reserve

www.parks.org.il; Rte 99; adult/child 29/15NIS, incl Nimrod Fortress 40/20NIS; h8am-4pm or 5pm Sat-Thu, 8am-3pm or 4pm Fri) form one of the most beautiful – and popular – nature spots in Israel. The park has two entrances on Rte 99 that are about 3.5km (1½ hours on foot) apart. The name ‘Banias’ derives from Pan, Greek god of the countryside, to whom the area was dedicated.
            Many sections of the park’s four trails (trail map provided) are shaded by oak, plane, fig and carob trees. Near the Banias Waterfall (lower) entrance, the Suspended Trail, a boardwalk cantilevered out over the rushing Banias (Hermon) Stream, gives a pretty good idea of what the Garden of Eden might look like. A bit upstream is the 10.5m Banias Waterfall, with its sheer, thundering drop into a deep pool. Tempting as it may look, swimming is prohibited.
            Near the Banias Springs (upper) entrance, the excavated ruins of a palace complex built by Herod’s grandson, Agrippa II, can be seen on a 45-minute walking circuit.
            Both entrances are served by Rama bus 58 from Kiryat Shmona to Majdal Shams.
          
        
        
          Nimrod Fortress
          
            Built by the Muslims in the 13th century to protect the road from Tyre to Damascus, Nimrod Fortress (%04-694 9277; www.parks.org.il; Rte 989; adult/child 22/10NIS; h8am-4pm or 5pm Sat-Thu, 8am-3pm or 4pm Fri, last entry 1hr before closing) towers fairy-tale-like on 

a long, narrow ridge (altitude 815m) on the southwestern slopes of Mt Hermon. The work that went into building such a massive fortification – 420m long and up to 150m wide – on the top of a remote mountain ridge boggles the mind. If you’re going to visit just one Crusader-era fortress during your trip, this should be it.
            Background on the fortress’ colourful medieval history, including its destruction by the Mongols, can be found in the excellent English map-brochure given out at the ticket booth. Highlights include an intact 13th-century hall, complete with angled archers slits, in the Northern Tower.
            The castle, visible from all over the Hula Valley, is protected by near-vertical cliffs and vertiginous canyons on all sides but one. South of Nimrod is Wadi Sa’ar, which divides the Golan’s basalt plateau (to the south) from the limestone flanks of Mt Hermon (to the north).
            The fortress is served by Rama bus 58 from Kiryat Shmona to Majdal Shams.

              The closest thing Israel has to a Swiss Alpine village, this mountainside moshav, on the flanks of mighty Mt Hermon, is a good base for hiking in summer and skiing in winter. B&B prices rise in winter because of heating costs.

          %04  /  Pop 10,200

The largest of Golan’s four Druze towns – big enough to have traffic jams – Majdal Shams serves as the commercial and cultural centre of the Golan Druze community. Druze flags flutter in the wind, and you often see men with elaborate curling moustaches sporting traditional Druze attire, including a black shirwal (baggy pants) and a white fez. That said, the town is considerably less conservative than most Druze villages: young women dress like typical secular Israelis and alcohol is available in several pubs.
              Higher education is hugely important here. Before civil war engulfed Syria, some 400 Golan Druze studied at Syrian universities. Now most young locals choose to pursue university studies in either Israel or Germany.

                  Druze families separated by the conflict between Israel and Syria long used megaphones to communicate with relatives and friends assembled on opposite sides of a UN-controlled ravine on the eastern outskirts of town. In recent years Skype and cellphones have pretty much replaced this ritual, which featured prominently in the award-winning 2004 film The Syrian Bride.


Mt Hermon
          
            Israel’s only ski station (%1 599 550 560, 03-606 0640; www.hermonski.com; Rte 98; winter adult/child 49/44NIS, summer free; h7am or 8am-4pm, last entry 3.30pm) is at the far northern tip of the Golan, high atop Mt Hermon, known for its crisp mountain air (even in summer), delicate alpine plants and unpredictable snowfall. The mountain’s 2814m summit is in Syrian territory; the highest point controlled by Israel is 2236m. Once you're inside the site, you can stay until sundown.
            The facilities at Mt Hermon look like a low-altitude, low-budget ski station in the Alps, circa 1975, which is why you'll be greeted by cheesy, giant snowmen made of styrofoam. In good years there are 30 to 40 ski days between December and March, not enough to meet demand, so the pistes are often crowded. In bad years, the pistes may hardly open at all. Edibles are available at a number of snack bars, only one of which stays open in summer.
            In winter, there’s usually 3m or 4m of snow at the top of Mt Hermon; the record, set in 1992, was 10m. Details on ski conditions are available by phone or online.
            Hitting the slopes of Mt Hermon can be pricey – but for Israelis it’s a lot cheaper than flying to Austria (before 1948, Palestinian Jews with a passion for winter sports used to head to Lebanon). In addition to entry fees (paid at toll booths on the road up), costs include a ski pass (all-day/afternoon 245/200NIS) and equipment rental, which can 

include skis (adult/child 140/120NIS), a snowboard (170NIS) and a ski suit (120NIS).
            The site has three blue (easy) runs, seven red (difficult) runs and two runs rated black (very difficult). The longest is 1248m, with a vertical drop of 376m; the highest begins at 2036m. To get you uphill, there are 11 lifts, including five chair lifts and five T-bars.
            If you decide to ski, make sure your travel insurance covers ‘high-risk’ sports and includes evacuation.
            In the warm season, there’s access to the summit – and its riot of alpine wildflowers – by chair lift (adult/child 3-12 years 49/42NIS; last descent 3.30pm). The ride is a blast, with great mountain views, but there's not much to see up top except Israeli bunkers in the distance, so it's worth timing your ascent to coincide with a free, 1½-hour guided walk (11am and 1pm daily from late May to Sukkot), led by an SPNI guide, that takes a look at plants, flowers and local military history; get to the lift a half hour ahead. The blooming season up here lasts from late May to August, which is three or four months later than on the coast.
            The ski station is about 9km up the hill from Majdal Shams along Rte 98.

West Bank


Why Go?
        
          'Welcome' is a word you hear a lot in the West Bank. Whether it is shouted by a street trader in a bustling souk, expressed with a smile over a plate of felafel or roared from a taxi over booming Arabic music, Palestinians are forever wanting to make tourists feel appreciated.
          Given the popular conception of the West Bank as a poster child for strife and violence, this might surprise some visitors; and it is true that dirt-poor refugee camps, barbed-wire checkpoints and the towering separation wall are rarely far from the eye. But there is another Palestine too, one of bustling cities and chaotic souks, rolling hills and traditional villages, olive groves and chalky desertscapes, where biblical sites abound. 
          But perhaps most appealing is the chance to meet Palestinians who remain hopeful of peace and stability even under untold pressures. The West Bank may not be the easiest place in which to travel – but the effort is richly rewarded.

      History
      
        The West Bank, as a geographical designation, was a creation of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, which resulted in areas north, east and south of Jerusalem – the 22% of Mandatory Palestine now known as the West Bank – falling under Jordanian control. The name is derived from the area’s position on the western bank of the Jordan River (the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is sometimes known as the East Bank).


Historically, Jews have called the area Judea (Yehuda) and Samaria (Shomron), in reference to the West Bank’s southern and northern lobes, respectively. Contemporary use of this expression – the preferred nomenclature among Jewish settlers and right-wing Israeli governments – is contentious since it suggests a belief that contemporary Israeli policy should be based on the biblical boundaries of the Land of Israel. You may also hear the terms ‘the Occupied Palestinian Territories’ or ‘the Territories’.
        West Bank Palestinian culture still bears the stamp of 400 years of Ottoman Turkish rule, during which the area was part of the Ottoman province of Syria. Shorter occupations, such as the post-WWI British Mandate (1917–48), have also left their mark (English is still taught widely in Palestinian schools).
        Although few in number, Jews maintained a presence in the West Bank (particularly in Hebron) throughout the Ottoman period. In the late 19th and 20th centuries large numbers of Jews immigrated from Russia, Yemen and other countries to Palestine but few settled in the mountainous parts of Palestine that would later become the West Bank.
        During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Jordan captured (and later annexed) the West Bank, only to lose control of the area to Israel in the 1967 Six Day War. During the 1970s and 1980s Jordan sought to reunify the West Bank with the East Bank but relinquished all claims to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in 1988.
        In the wake of the First Intifada (Arabic for ‘uprising’ or ‘shaking off’), from 1987 to 1993, the Oslo 

Accords were set. These interim agreements between the Israeli government and the PLO gave control of some areas (such as Jericho, Ramallah and Jenin) to the newly created Palestinian Authority, and implied the possibility of a future Palestinian state.
        Both sides were unhappy with the accords and their aftermath. Violence continued, with  both Israeli and Palestinian deaths. The failure of US-sponsored peace talks at Camp David in 2000 paved the way for the outbreak of the Second Intifada that year.
        The Second Intifada (2000–05) brought the worst violence in a generation. High-profile killings shocked both sides. Bloody battles and military attacks caused thousands of casualties inside the West Bank and Gaza and there were scores of suicide bombings inside Israel. In response, Israel constructed a sophisticated separation wall, sealing off the West Bank from Israel.
        In 2006 Hamas, a militant  Islamic group, won parliamentary elections, causing the prompt scale-back of international aid (because many countries consider Hamas a terrorist organisation) and squeeze of financial lifelines. After a struggle for power with Fatah, isolated Hamas did not take control of the West Bank, which was taken by Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas, but did hold control of Gaza.
        That division remains today, as does a state of affairs under which the vast majority of West Bank Palestinians are unable to trade and travel freely or visit relatives either in Israel or Gaza. 
        The spectacular failure of the US-sponsored peace initiative between Israel and Palestine in April 2014 

meant that, for the first time in decades (outside of wartime) there was no ongoing peace process.
        The kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers outside a West Bank settlement in June 2014 led to a massive military crackdown in Palestinian cities, with hundreds of arrests, and Israel Defense Forces (IDF) incursions into Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron on a scale not seen since the Second Intifada. The action led to demonstrations across the West Bank, which intensified during the 2014 war in Gaza, when West Bank Palestinians took to the streets to protest civilian casualties in the strip.
        Across the cities of the Fatah-ruled Palestinian Authority, you’ll spot big banners proclaiming the Palestinians’ right to a seat at the United Nations as well as calls for Palestinian rights to return to land lost in 1948. At the same time, their discontent simmers as the Israeli government continues to expand Jewish settlements in the region. In the meantime, the Palestinians maintain efforts to build their institutions and economy – and to push for an independent homeland.

TIMES & DATES
      
        The West Bank day of rest is Friday, but in Bethlehem and Ramallah some shops might close on Sundays due to Christian ownership. During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, shopkeepers scale back opening hours, as do some attractions, and in the daytime you will only find food in Christian establishments (it’s unlikely you’ll go hungry in Bethlehem or Ramallah).
      
    
    
      1Climate
      
        Bethlehem, like Jerusalem, can be snowy in winter and enjoys cooler climes in the midst of the otherwise sweltering summer. If you’re seeking Yuletide spirit, bring your woolly jumper and don’t miss out on a crisp, cold Bethlehem Christmas. Balmier Jericho is the place to escape chillier winter days, and can be oppressively hot during the summer months. If you’re considering doing some hiking around Wadi Qelt or elsewhere, spring and autumn are the best times.


ONE-WEEK ITINERARY
      
        With a growing number of hotels and an excellent transport network in the West Bank, travellers no longer need to use Jerusalem as a base for excursions. Not only does staying overnight avoid having to deal with time-consuming daily checkpoints and rush-hour traffic, but it pumps much-needed shekels into the West Bank economy.
        Get in a full day of sightseeing around Bethlehem before a day trip to Hebron. Then, from Bethlehem take a service taxi to Jericho, and tour the city and surrounding desert sites. Next travel to Nablus (via Ramallah) for a city tour and much-needed visit to the bathhouse. In Jenin see the Freedom Theatre and Burqi’in, before heading back to spend a day around Ramallah, checking out its hip bars and cafes, and Taybeh, where you can visit the Palestinian Territories' only brewery.
      
    
    
      TTours
      
        Backpacker hostels, including those in Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah and Bethlehem, are excellent places to ask about tours, and for those travelling solo they provide good opportunities to meet others and share costs. 
        Those who want to set up a tour before they leave should contact one of a number of organisations that offer tours; Green Olive Tours is particularly recommended. The Beit Sahour–based Siraj Center for 

Holy Land Studies runs cycling and walking trips. Two other recommendations:

        INSIDE THE WEST BANK
        
          To make the West Bank all the more accessible, explore the work of some of the following organisations:
          Alternative Tourism Group (%02-277 2151; www.patg.org; 74 Star St, Beit Sahour) Offers plenty of information, and recommended day tours of Hebron and Bethlehem.
          Palestine Fair Trade Association (%04-250 1512; www.palestinefairtrade.org) Organises homestays and voluntary work placements in Palestinian homes and farms, particularly during the annual olive harvest.
          Palestinian Association for Cultural Exchange (%02-240 7611; www.pace.ps) Offers one-day and longer tours of Nablus, Hebron, Qalqilya and around. 



Supports local cooperatives and can arrange lecture programs.
          Siraj Center for Holy Land Studies (%02-274 8590; www.sirajcenter.org) Organises and coordinates plenty of activities and ‘encounters’ throughout the West Bank.
        
      
    
    
      8Getting There & Around
      
        The West Bank is served by an excellent and easy-to-use public transport network, and buses and shared taxis (pronounced ser-vees) run from the major cities to most – if not all – sites and cities you will want to visit. Most signs are in Arabic but as long as you know the name of where you are going, it is relatively easy to get on the right bus or shared taxi and it will set you back a fraction of the cost of a private taxi. To Taybeh from Ramallah, for example, a service taxi is 7NIS while a private car is 70NIS. Most buses, even between cities, will cost between 5NIS and 20NIS.
        Since distances are short (and local knowledge of roads essential) many tourists choose to hire a taxi by the hour or for the day. Ask a tour operator to set you up with a reliable driver. Most taxi drivers in Bethlehem are used to the needs of tourists and can run ad hoc day trips all over the West Bank. They hang around Bab iz-Qaq or the entrance to the Bethlehem checkpoint. Prepare to haggle hard.
        If you’re considering driving yourself, bear in mind that most Israeli rental-car agencies won’t allow you to take their cars into Palestinian-con
trolled areas. Dallah and Goodluck (www.goodluckcars.com) are notable exceptions; both are based close to Jerusalem's American Colony Hotel. Palestinian roads are a mixed bag; potholes and bad signage can be a problem, but it is the quirks of Palestinian driving that may prove the biggest challenge, especially for first-time Middle East drivers. A general rule is every man or woman for him/herself.
        Israeli licence plates are yellow, while Palestinian plates are green and white. Yellow-plated cars, while fine to drive throughout most of the West Bank – especially in more peaceful times – might cause you to be mistaken for an Israeli or Jewish settler and treated with hostility. Some tourists place a keffiyeh on the dashboard to avoid trouble in the more fraught areas.
        Since roadblocks, settlement construction and separation wall building work are all ongoing, accessibility and roads can change quickly. It pays to buy an up-to-date road map (maps bought in Israel cover the West Bank, too). GPS is largely useless on the Palestinian side of the green line, and the best way to find your destination is to roll down the window and ask someone.



CHECKPOINTS
        
          Checkpoints (in Hebrew, machsomim) control the flow of travellers between the West Bank and Israel. There are also some checkpoints inside the West Bank, although these tend to be less stable, shifting locations, shutting down altogether or popping up in new locations. Most checkpoints are run by the IDF, although some have been outsourced to private contractors. The latter tend to be more troublesome and more likely to question foreigners and search their bags.
          Operating hours of checkpoints vary, often depending on whether the primary users are settlers or Palestinians. For example, the checkpoint leading south from Jerusalem on Rte 60 near Bethlehem is open 24/7, while Bethlehem checkpoint 300 (which leads into Bethlehem city) is sometimes closed at night (but not always). Checkpoints used by Palestinians are subject to random closures, especially around Jewish holidays, when the West Bank is sometimes sealed for security reasons.
          Checkpoints range in size from small pedestrian-only checkpoints, such as Abu Dis, to larger ones that accommodate vehicles and resemble an international border crossing, such as the Bethlehem 300 checkpoint. ‘Flying checkpoints’ are temporary IDF roadblocks set up inside the West Bank. Delays depend on the volume of traffic. Checkpoints set up by Palestinian police exist too (for example, near Jericho) but traffic generally flows smoothly through them.
          In general, travellers are not checked when going into the West Bank, only when travelling from the West Bank back into Israel.
          Foreign-passport holders are allowed to travel through IDF checkpoints into areas under the con
trol of the Palestinian Authority but by military order, Israeli citizens are (theoretically) forbidden from doing so.
          There is no cost involved with crossing a checkpoint and foreign-passport holders do not need any special documentation. Just show your passport and visa and put your bags through an X-ray machine. The procedure is generally fast but with waiting time you can expect to be at a checkpoint for 15 to 20 minutes (or longer if lines have formed).
          Try to avoid passing through a checkpoint in the early morning (7am to 9am) or on Muslim or Jewish holidays due to long lines.
          Foreigners can take a vehicle into and out of the West Bank (if you’ve got a rental car, make sure your insurance policy covers travel to the Palestinian Authority – most don’t) but there can sometimes be delays upon your return to Israel because the soldiers may inspect the vehicle for explosives.
          The following are some of the main checkpoints into and out of the West Bank:
          Qalandia – Between Jerusalem and Ramallah. Use this checkpoint for Ramallah, Nablus and Jenin. This is one of the busiest checkpoints and it sports some fairly grim metal corrals and locking turnstiles of the sort you’d expect to see at a maximum-security prison. There is actually a checkpoint on both sides of the road – one for pedestrians and the other for bus travellers.
          Bethlehem 300 – Located south of Jerusalem at the entrance to Rachel’s Tomb. One road leads to the checkpoint for cars and one for pedestrians. This is an indoor checkpoint and the conditions are better than the one at Qalandia, but opening hours are not reliable and it is sometimes closed at night.
          Bethlehem (highway) – You will go through this checkpoint if you take bus 21 from Bethlehem. It 
resembles a toll gate and security is very light. Tourists may remain on the bus during the passport check (Palestinian passengers are asked to line up outside the bus). It’s open 24/7.
          Jalameh – Located 10km south of Afula, this checkpoint is one of the best in terms of ease and accessibility. However, long lines have been reported and it is only open between 8am and 5pm.
          Abu Dis – This checkpoint connects East Jerusalem to Abu Dis, from where travellers can connect to Jericho. It is a pedestrian-only checkpoint and is usually closed at night.
          For more details on the conditions at individual checkpoints, visit the website of the left-wing Israeli group Machsom Watch, www.machsomwatch.org.

          Most visitors come to Bethlehem with a preconceived image – a small stone village, a manger and shepherds in their fields – thanks to memories of a childhood nativity, perhaps, or years of scenic Christmas cards.
          The reality is quite different. Bethlehem positively hums with activity, its winding streets congested with traffic and its main square filled with snap-happy tourists scrambling to keep up with their guides.
          Churches now cover many of the holy sites but there is plenty to see and do for even for the non-reli
gious. There’s a lively Old City and bazaar, plus sites around town including the incredible Herodium. At the numerous cultural centres you can critique local art, watch performances and talk politics.
          Most travellers come on a day trip but to get the most out of your visit it’s best to stay overnight – accommodation and food are both cheaper than in Jerusalem.
        
      
      
        STREET ART IN BETHLEHEM
        
          When British graffiti artist Bansky first daubed his now world-famous pictures close to the heavily fortified concrete wall that separates Bethlehem from Jerusalem he did more than give Palestinian tour guides another feather in their cap.
          The artist – who has tagged a number of locations in Bethlehem since visiting in 2005 – started a trend that, a decade on, has seen swathes of the separation wall covered in colourful, political graffiti by both local and foreign street artists.
          From Checkpoint 300 it is an easy walk tracing the wall through now-deserted Palestinian neighbourhoods to the entrance to Aida refugee camp. Along the way you will see huge portraits of Palestinian fighters, flags and all manner of slogans.

At Bansky Shop, started by local entrepreneur Yamen Elabed, you can pick up all manner of street art themed merchandise, and arrange tours with local street artists. The shop also has spray paint, so you can add your own mark to the wall.
          Banksy's own three offerings are still visible but are not on the wall itself. Locals will point the way, and taxi drivers are always happy to include a viewing as part of their package.
        
      
      
        History
        
          Built along ancient footpaths, the little town where Mary and Joseph went for a census and returned with a son has had residents since as far back as the Palaeolithic era. The town is thought to have first developed in the 14th century BCE as a city state named Beit Lahmu (after Lahmu, goddess of protection), and later took the Hebrew Bible name, Ephrata.
          Then in 313 CE, three centuries after the birth of Jesus, the Roman Emperor Constantine made Christianity the official state religion. Bethlehem soon became a popular, well-to-do pilgrimage town, with flourishing monasteries and churches. In 638 the city was conquered by Muslims, but a treaty was signed guaranteeing Christians property rights and religious freedom, and Bethlehem continued to prosper for the next millennium or so.
          Bethlehem’s numbers swelled after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, when Palestinian refugees from the newly created State of Israel poured into town. Many continue to live, along with their descendants, in the 
refugee camps of Aida, Dheisheh and Al-Azzah on the edges of town.
          Today Bethlehem continues to rely – as it has for the last 1700 years or so – on the tourist and pilgrim trade. It is easily the most visited city in the West Bank, especially around Christian holidays, with crowds flocking here for Easter and for the traditional Christmas Eve midnight Mass.

          From Bab iz-Qaq (where bus 121 from Jerusalem stops) walk up Pope Paul VI St for five minutes to Cinema Sq, from where it’s a 10-minute walk to Manger Sq. For those who took the bus to the checkpoint, there are taxi drivers waiting to bring you into the city for around 20NIS.
          If you get a taxi to Manger Sq, walk from here up along bustling Pope Paul VI St (taking in the souq to the left), then take a right to loop around and return down charming Star St for an atmospheric taste of the Old City.
          Most of the city’s other sights are within walking distance of the town centre; pick up a taxi down on Manger St or on Manger Sq to venture to Shepherds’ Field, Mar Saba Monastery or Herodium.
          Opening hours of churches and other sites in (and outside) Bethlehem can change without notice, but a general rule in the West Bank is to start early and expect most sites to close their doors at sunset or an hour before.

visit, negotiate a price for a tour from one of the handful of tour guides you’ll find milling outside (around 50NIS per hour is a decent price): they know all the nooks and crannies intimately, and may even introduce you to some of the resident priests and monks.
            
            
              A major restoration project recently took place on its exterior – as of September 2014 the church had been restored to its former glory.
              You might be surprised, if you’ve never seen pictures, to find that the facade of the church is only a tiny Ottoman-era front door, aptly named the Door of Humility. Watch your head as you bow through – originally the entrance was much larger, but the Crusaders reduced its size to prevent attackers from riding in. Later, either during the Mamluk or Ottoman periods, the portal was made even smaller – you can still see the outline of the original 6th-century doorway and, within it, the pointed Crusader-era arch. Proceed to the cavernous nave. Renovations over the centuries have included a new floor here, beneath which lies Constantine’s original 4th-century mosaic floor, rediscovered in 1934 and now viewable through wooden trapdoors in the central aisle.
              The 6th century saw the church rebuilt almost entirely by Emperor Justinian, after the majority of it was destroyed in a Samaritan revolt. The mammoth red-and-white limestone columns that still grace the nave are probably the only surviving remnants of the original structure, their stone quarried from nearby. Some of them are decorated with frescos of saints, painted by Crusaders in the 12th century. To the 
right of the Door of Humility, a doorway leads to the Armenian Monastery, these days housing just six monks to service the needs of Bethlehem’s 300-strong Armenian congregation. The Armenians flourished during the 1600s, when they were noted for their transcribed and illuminated versions of the Bible.
              At the front of the nave, descend the stairs to enter the Grotto of the Nativity. It’s popular with tour groups, but if you time your visit over lunchtime midweek, you’ll likely have the grotto entirely to yourself (on a weekend you may have to stand in line for an hour or more). There is a rather zealous security guard who has been known to physically eject pilgrims that he thinks are staying too long. Atmospherically lantern-lit and redolent with mystery, this is where Jesus is said to have been born, the 14-pointed silver star marking the spot. The Chapel of the Manger or ‘the Crib’ to one side of the grotto represents the scene of the nativity, while the chapel facing it houses the Altar of the Adoration of the Magi, which commemorates the visit of Caspar, Balthazar and Melchior. The Persians spared the church and grotto when they sacked Palestine in 614 CE, ostensibly because they saw a depiction of the magi in their own native costume.
              Though all might seem serene down here, conflict has actually rocked this cradle for ages. The 14-pointed star was stolen in 1847, each of the three Christian communities in residence (the Greek Orthodox, the Armenians and the Catholics, who have bitterly and ceaselessly fought for custodian
ship of the grotto) blaming the others. A copy was subsequently supplied to replace it, but the fights didn’t end there, and administrative domination of the church changed hands repeatedly between the Orthodox and Catholics. To this day, management of the church is divvied up metre for metre between the Orthodox, Catholic and Armenian clerics (this system of management for holy places is known as the ‘status quo’). Take the grotto lanterns for example: six belong to the Greek Orthodox, five to the Armenians and four to the Catholics.

              A short walk from Manger Sq is the lesser-known Milk Grotto Chapel. The white rock inside this stony chapel is said to bring milk to a mother’s bosom and enhance fertility in women who swallow a morsel of the chalky substance. Legend has it that Mary and Joseph stopped here to feed the baby during their 
flight to Egypt; a drop of milk touched the red rock, turning it white.

              Opposite the Church of the Nativity, is this mosque, named after the 2nd Muslim caliph, Omar Ibn al-Khattab. It is the sole mosque in Bethlehem’s Old City. It was built in 1860 on land granted by the Greek Orthodox Church in honour of Omar, the Prophet Mohammed’s father-in-law, who in 637 took Jerusalem from the flagging Byzantines and then stopped for prayer at the Christian Church of the Nativity. He declared, in his Pact of Omar, that the basilica would remain a Christian shrine, and that Christians, even under Muslim rule, would remain free to practise their faith.
            
          
        Rachel’s TombRELIGIOUS(h12.30-10.30pm Sun-Wed, 24hrs Thu)
            
              In a desolate corridor created by Israel’s separation wall, near the main checkpoint into town on the Israeli side of the wall, stands Rachel’s Tomb. Another Bethlehem sojourner during labour, Rachel is said to have died here in childbirth, on the way south to Hebron, after which her husband, Jacob, ‘set a pillar upon her grave’ (Genesis 35:20). 
              Today the tomb is completely surrounded by the separation wall, and visiting the site is difficult. The gate can be reached on Arab bus 24, and Egged bus 
163 from Jerusalem’s Central Bus Station goes all the way to the tomb. 
            
            
              Once at the tomb there are separate sides for men and women (kippas for men are available at the door).
              Revered by followers of all three Abrahamic religions – Jews and Muslims in particular – it has been enshrined and guarded for centuries, from the Byzantine and Islamic eras through to the Crusaders, and during the epochs of the Ottomans and Israelis.

        JEWISH SETTLEMENTS
        
          Israeli Jewish colonies set up in the Palestinian Territories are most often referred to as ‘settlements’. There are currently approximately 350,000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank, living in more than 100 settlements, with hundreds of thousands more living in parts of Jerusalem captured by Israel in 1967.
          Settlements range in size from a collection of caravans on a remote hilltop to large urban areas, such as Ma’ale Adumim near Jerusalem, home to tens of thousands of Israelis and now effectively a suburb of Jerusalem. There are a variety of reasons cited by settlers for why they live on the West Bank: most commonly, cheaper housing prices than in Israel and, among the religious, the fulfilment of biblical prophecy and an extension of the will of God.
Under almost all interpretations of international law, which forbids the transfer of civilians to land under military occupation, all Israeli settlements on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem are illegal. The Israeli right disputes this interpretation of international law. Key complaints against Jewish settlements are that they often occupy private Palestinian land (as opposed to state-owned land), divert precious water resources from surrounding Palestinian cities, towns and villages and, most significantly, fragment the territory of the West Bank, making the establishment of a coherent, contiguous and viable Palestinian state impossible.
          The USA and European Union have declared the settlements an obstacle to peace, but Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition government has continued to construct housing in West Bank settlements and East Jerusalem, announcing plans throughout 2014 to build thousands of new settlement units on Palestinian land.
          To find out more, visit the websites of Palestinian NGO Al-Haq's (alhaq.mits.ps) or left-wing Israeli organisation B’Tselem (www.btselem.org). For a settler's perspective, the settlement of Gush Etzion, near Bethlehem, has a visitor centre and museum (www.gush-etzion.org.il).



WEST BANK AREAS
          
            The West Bank is divided into three areas, designating the amount of civil and military power exercised by Israelis and Palestinians.
            
              Area A (around 17%): under full Palestinian civil and military control; you’ll see Israeli signs forbidding Israelis from entering. Includes the cities of Ramallah, Nablus, Tulkarem, Jenin, Qalqilya, Bethlehem, Jericho, parts of Hebron and some other small towns and villages.
              Area B (around 24%): under Palestinian civil control but Israeli military control. Includes many rural Palestinian areas.
              Area C (about 59%): under full Israeli control. Includes many sparsely populated areas, outskirts 
of towns and villages, and the West Bank's highway network.



TRAVEL WARNING
        
          In recent years the West Bank has proved largely safe for Western visitors, and the chances of encountering any trouble are unlikely. That said, the West Bank is under military occupation and the situation is in constant flux. Flare-ups between Israeli soldiers and stone-throwing Palestinian youths are not uncommon, particularly on Fridays.
          Keep your eye on the news and travel advice and don't be afraid to email ahead to your hostel or hotel for advice. It goes without saying that tourists should stay clear of protests, particularly those near Israeli checkpoints or settlements and specifically in Hebron, where the situation can escalate quickly.
          On entering Israel, you will be asked where you intend to visit, and often whether you intend to travel to the West Bank. If you answer in the affirmative you may be held up for a while.



Around Bethlehem
      
        Bethlehem makes a good base for excursions to other West Bank cities, especially Hebron, but there are also some worthwhile sights close to home.
      
      
        Shepherds’ Field
        
          If you’ve always wondered where exactly ‘shepherds watched their flocks by night’ (Luke 2:8), drop into Shepherds’ Field, a parklike area just outside Beit Sahour, to see for yourself. While the Beit Sahour Shepherds’ Field isn’t the only Bethlehem location earmarked as the exact spot the heavenly host visited to announce Jesus’s birth to a group of shepherds, it’s certainly the most frequented. As well as the 
strollable grounds, you’ll find a Byzantine cave housing a chapel and the 1953 Italian-designed Church of the Angels, with its lovely, light interior.
          To reach Shepherds’ Field take a private taxi from Bethlehem (15NIS) or catch Beit Sahour–bound bus 47 (2NIS) from Shepherd’s St, just below Manger Sq.
        
      
      
        Herodium 
        
          King Herod’s spectacular fortress-palace, Herodium (adult/child 27/14NIS; h8am-5pm Apr-Sep, 8am-4pm Oct-Mar), built between 23 and 15 BCE, was known through the centuries to Arab inhabitants as the Mountain of Paradise.
          Even from a distance, you won’t miss the site: it rises from the Judean Desert like a flat-topped caricature of a volcano (the top is actually an extension of the natural hill, hollowed out to hold Herod’s palace), 9km south of Beit Sahour. The complex features a series of stunning remains of Herod’s own personal ‘country club’ (which included a bathhouse and rooftop pool) and also includes King Herod’s own tomb, discovered in 2007. Though it was sacked by the Romans in 71 CE, around the same time as Masada was similarly assaulted, much remains at the site, with still more awaiting further excavation – including a network of tunnels used by Jewish rebels during their uprising against Rome. You can clamber through many of the tunnels today.
Note that Herodium falls under ‘Area C’ and is thus under full Israeli control (you’ll see the military base at the foot of the hill); the site itself is administered by the Israeli Parks and Nature Authority (www.parks.org.il). To get here, take a private taxi from Bethlehem (around 50NIS per hour), and negotiate at least an hour’s waiting time. Try to avoid Fridays, when Herodium fills with tour buses from Israel.
        
        
          VISITING A REFUGEE CAMP
          
            The term ‘refugee camp’ brings to mind crowded tents, food riots and waterborne disease. But the refugee camps in the West Bank have existed for more than 60 years, time enough to transform them into established neighbourhoods with housing, schools, hospitals and other infrastructure. The camps were developed – and are still run – by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency but limited funding has allowed the UN to only build the most basic facilities.
            Although the camps are not a hotbed of tourism, some travellers are keen to visit them to experience a different side of Palestinian life. While the camps are generally safe, it’s best to be aware of the risks, as the security situation can change at a moment’s notice. One minute it’s all clear but the next minute 
violence might break out between demonstrators and Israeli soldiers, filling the air with tear gas, hurled stones and rubber bullets.
            Israel Defence Forces raids are more likely in Nablus, Hebron and Jenin but have occurred in Bethlehem too. In any refugee camp it’s best to visit with a Palestinian guide who understands the security situation – these guides are easily sourced, either through your hotel or hostel or through one of the numerous organisations that work in the camps.
          
          
            AIDA REFUGEE CAMP
            
              This camp is located in the shadow of Israel’s separation wall, near Rachel’s Tomb. A cornerstone of the community is the Al Rowwad Centre (%02-275 0030; www.alrowwad.org), which offers drama, music, computer and arts training, as well as arranging special classes and workshops for women, the blind and residents with disabilities. A taxi from the city centre should cost 20NIS.
            
          
          
            DHEISHEH REFUGEE CAMP
            
              Located 3km west of Bethlehem, this camp was founded in 1948 to house refugees from 45 villages around Jerusalem and Hebron. The camp is home to the Ibdaa Cultural Centre (www.ibdaa48.org), the headquarters for a world-renowned youth folk-dance troupe. It also supports a media centre, trade school, women’s leadership initiative, basketball league, restaurant and the Ibdaa Cultural Centre Guesthouse. The centre has a gift shop where you can purchase bags, clothing and other items produced by residents of the camp. It also runs tours of the camp; payment is by donation. To get to Dheisheh, catch a private taxi (20NIS) from the city centre, or a service taxi (3NIS) at Bab iz-Qaq in Bethlehem.




Al-Khader Church 
        
          Just outside Bethlehem, on the road to Hebron, Al-Khader Church (St George’s; Jerusalem–Hebron Rd; h8am-noon & 3-6pm Sun & holidays) is dedicated to St George, famous enemy to dragons and patron saint of travellers and the sick. St George is also known as the patron saint of Palestine, or St George the Green; his feast day is celebrated annually on 5 May with a pilgrimage out to the church, attended by both Christians and Muslims. 
          Someone from the Muslim family entrusted with the keys to the small Greek Orthodox church will perform a chaining ritual at your request, ceremonially chaining and unchaining any visitor desiring to release bad energy, cleanse the soul, cast off illness or prepare for a long journey. It’s said that this derives from the practice (thankfully no longer undertaken) of chaining the mentally disturbed to the walls in the hope that St George might cure their insanity. 
          You can take a private taxi from Bethlehem (20NIS) to Al-Khader. 
        
      
      
        Solomon’s Pools 
        
          A prominent site in the Al-Khader area is Solomon’s Pools. During Roman times a system of springs filled three mammoth rectangular reservoirs supplying water via aqueducts to Jerusalem and Herodium. King Solomon enjoyed respite beside their serene 
shimmer, where he is said to have written the sensuous Song of Solomon. The springs were used into the 20th century for irrigating crops in the surrounding fertile valley, while successive armies have also set up camp here. An Ottoman fortress is still evident, the historic last stop for pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem.
          Unfortunately, the pools are now fenced off and the water largely drained, so it’s no longer a very picturesque place. Only travellers with a serious interest in history make it this way. A new conference centre was recently built next to the site.
          To reach Solomon’s Pools from Bethlehem take Dheisheh bus 1 (3NIS) from Manger Sq, or private taxi (20NIS).
        
      
      
        Mar Saba Monastery 
        
          A must-see on any journey through the Holy Land is Mar Saba Monastery (h8am-sunset Sat-Tue & Thu), a bleak and beautiful 20km drive east of Bethlehem (beyond Beit Sahour). This phenomenal cliff-clinging copper-domed hermitage, founded in 439 CE, is best seen from the opposite slope, but men can exercise their privilege by going inside and getting a tour with one of the 15 monks still in residence. Women can get a bird’s-eye view from the Women’s Tower, a rather squat structure opposite the monastery itself. 
          Also residing here (rather more eternally) are the remains of 5th-century ascetic St Sabas, whose body lies in the church’s second chapel, and the skulls of some 120 monks massacred here in 614 CE.

For those who are driving, the monastery is well signposted from Beit Sahour. Otherwise you’ll need to take a private taxi out to Mar Saba from Bethlehem; plan on around a three-hour journey, costing around 120NIS to 150NIS.
        
      
      
        ISRAEL’S SEPARATION WALL
        
          From 1967 until the Second Intifada (2000–05), most Palestinians were still able to cross into Israel from the West Bank with relative ease, many commuting on a daily basis.
          But in the mid-1990s and even more so during the Second Intifada, scores of suicide bombers crossed into Israel from the West Bank, killing hundreds of Israeli civilians. Israel responded with military incursions into areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority, and both security experts and the Israeli public called on the government to build a security barrier to prevent infiltration.
          From the point of view of the Israeli left, a barrier would only further the Oslo Accords  process (which had as its goal the establishment of two separate states), along the lines of ‘good fences make good 

neighbours’. But there was opposition, from Jewish settlers not wanting to find themselves on the West Bank side of the wall, and from West Bank Palestinians, whose villages and fields were bisected by the wall, and whose access to Jerusalem the borders made difficult or impossible.
          Except in Jerusalem, most of the barrier (about 5% of which is a concrete antisniper wall up to 8m high) matches the Green Line (the 1949 armistice between Israel and Jordan) – but only roughly. Quite a few sections loop and scoop around Jewish settlements, separating Palestinians from their communities, businesses, schools and crops. Palestinians call the separation wall the ‘Apartheid Wall’ and see it as part of a concerted campaign to grab land wherever possible. Israel – where the barrier is seen as a security success – says that the route of the wall can always be modified, eg if there is a final status accord on borders.
          Demonstrations are periodically held in parts of the West Bank where the wall cuts through villages. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) regularly disperse the crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets – as well as live ammunition, according to both local and international NGOs. Protestors have frequently been injured and some killed.
        
      
    
    
      Ramallah & Al-Bireh 
      %02  /  Pop 65,000
      
        
          Ramallah (the name means God’s Mountain) and Al-Bireh were once separate villages, but now make up one urban conglomerate, a mere 10km north of Jerusalem. Though Al-Bireh’s history can be traced 

back to the Canaanites, Ramallah was only settled by Christians in the 1500s, and these days is a bustling, cosmopolitan city, with a thriving art scene and vibrant nightlife.
          Ramallah may lack the religious fervour of Nablus, Hebron or, indeed, Jerusalem, but the Palestinian flags and graffiti that adorn every wall leave you in no doubt about where you are. While Israeli incursions into the city are unusual (although not unheard of), Ramallah has suffered greatly over the past few decades: much of the city was levelled during the Second Intifada, and it was here that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat spent the last weeks of his life, under siege.
          But Ramallah is not all about politics. The tiny shops, cafes and eateries that line the arteries that lead off Al-Manara Sq – with its iconic four lions – are fascinating places to wander around, and the nearby Al-Muntazah neighbourhood is packed with trendy cafes and bars. As the economic and political heart of the West Bank, Ramallah is home to a good deal of expatriates, English is widely spoken and transport links are superb. As such, it makes an excellent base for further forays into the West Bank.





Ramallah
1Sights & Activities
        
          Most tourists begin their exploration of Ramallah in Al-Manara Sq, which is a short walk downhill from the bus station where buses arrive from Jerusalem.
          The streets that branch off Al-Manara lead to the city's other neighbourhoods. Al-Ra'eesy St (also known as Main St) and Palestine St (directly opposite) lead to the Old City and the entrance to the street market respectively, and are packed with coffee shops and kebab houses.
          To reach the Al-Muntazah neighbourhood, head down the Jaffa Rd; take a right at the HSBC bank and head up Eisah Zeyada St, which has a host of chic cafes, bars and dining destinations.
          Set on a steep hill, Ramallah can be a disorientating and tiring place to get lost but locals can generally point you in the right direction. Taxis are also relatively cheap; a journey within the city should cost no more than 10NIS.
        
        Muqata’aHISTORIC BUILDING(Al-Itha’a St; htomb 9am-9pm daily)
Those interested in modern history might want to stop at the now-rebuilt Muqata’a, Yasser Arafat’s large presidential compound, where he was based during the last days of the Second Intifada. He was evacuated from his base in 2004 while under Israeli siege and later died in a Paris hospital. In 2014 his body was briefly exhumed for tests after speculation that he had been poisoned. Arafat's enormous cubicle tomb is guarded by soldiers and adorned with wreaths. 
            
            
              The compound's buildings have been restored, with the exception of some holes from tank shelling. The Muqata’a is around 1km from Al-Manara on the road to Birzeit and Nablus, and is easily walkable from downtown. Soldiers will not let tourists stray from the short path between the entrance and the tomb, but Muslims will be allowed to enter the modern mosque erected in Arafat's honour.

Getting There & Around
        
          From the old Arab bus station in East Jerusalem take bus 18 (30 minutes) all the way to Ramallah.
          As a rule of thumb; the smaller the bus the faster the journey. Buses to/from Ramallah operate from 6am to 9pm in summer or until 7pm in winter, after which you can take a service taxi from Ramallah to Qalandia and then a taxi to Jerusalem, or vice versa.
          You will not need to get off the bus on the way into the West Bank, but on the way out all passengers disembark and go through airport-style security. 
Have your passport and Israeli visa ready to show the soldiers behind the bulletproof glass.
          Also hold onto your ticket to show to the driver once you’re on the other side of the checkpoint.
          Everything within the Ramallah area is 10 minutes or less by private taxi and should cost 10NIS to 20NIS; but be sure to agree on the final price with the driver before setting off.
          The main bus station where buses arrive from Jerusalem has services to Nablus and Hebron, and the service taxi parking garage across the road (below Area D Hostel) has dirt cheap shared taxis to almost everywhere you could want to go in Palestine.
        
      
    
    
      Around Ramallah
      
        When a small Christian village is known more for its beer than for its Bible stories, one might think the past is forgotten. But the townsfolk in Taybeh hold fast to their heritage, raising a glass to the place they believe Jesus stayed with his disciples in his final hours (John 11:54). Sample its nectar at the Taybeh Beer Brewery (%02-289 8868; www.taybehbeer.net); call to arrange a tour, or drop by for its annual two-day Oktoberfest, a must-visit if you are anywhere in the region. 
        Taybeh is around 15km from Ramallah, on a reasonably remote – and very picturesque – hillside. The village is home to a number of interesting 


churches and chapels as well as fascinating Byzantine ruins. Take a shared taxi (7NIS) from the service taxi garage below Area D Hostel. In 2014 Taybeh began producing and bottling its own wine at the cavernous Taybeh Winery just a short walk from the brewery. Call ahead to arrange a tasting.
      
    
    
      Jericho & Around 
      %02  /  Pop 20,300
      
        
          Local authorities proudly call Jericho the ‘world’s oldest continuously inhabited city' and this is no idle boast – archaeological evidence traces the city’s history back over 10,000 years. But despite the biblical stories, it was earthquakes rather than trumpets that proved Jericho's biggest challenge, levelling some of its most fantastic sites – such as Hisham's Palace – over the centuries.
          Jericho has modernised somewhat since the Canaanite period, but not much. Small-scale farming still makes up a significant portion of the local economy, although tourism is making inroads. The town is rather scruffy and unkempt but retains a raffish charm and a smiley demeanour. Most visitors just stay long enough to ascend the Mount of Temptation and marvel at the archaeological remains of Tel al-Sultan (Ancient Jericho).
        
      
      
        History

Settled history in Jericho dates to around 10,000 BCE when hunter-gatherer groups settled here around a spring. Mudbrick buildings were erected at the site and by 9400 BCE it’s believed that some 1000 people lived here.
          For the biblically astute, Jericho is known as the first city the Israelites captured after wandering for 40 years in the desert: shaken by horn blasts and the Israelites’ shouts, the city walls came crashing down (Joshua 6). Following Alexander the Great’s conquest of the region in the 4th century BCE, Jericho became his personal fiefdom.
          Further waves of occupiers arrived and departed until Jericho fell into the hands of Mark Antony, who gave it to Cleopatra as a wedding gift. Herod later leased it from Cleopatra and improved its infrastructure with aqueducts and a hippodrome. The 1st-century aristocracy of Jerusalem used the city as a winter getaway.
          Christians celebrate Jericho as the place where John the Baptist received his own baptism in the Jordan River and where the temptation of Jesus took place on the mountain.
          In the 1967 Six Day War Israel captured Jericho from Jordan. After the signing of the 1993 Oslo Accords, it became the first city to be handed over to Palestinian Authority control. During the Second Intifada, the Israeli army attacked the Palestinian Authority prison and security headquarters in Jericho.
          Today Jericho has returned its attention to tourism and daily trade, and though you won’t find a great 
many foreign visitors in town, it makes an interesting stop for a night or two.
        
      
      
        1Sights & Activities
        
          A gaggle of storefronts and restaurants with colourful bouquets of household products, fresh produce and roasting snack foods spilling into the streets marks Jericho’s diminutive and dusty town centre. The Tree of Zacchaeus, nearby on Ein as-Sultan St (a sycamore said to be more than 2000 years old) received its name from the story of the wealthy tax collector who was too short to see Jesus amid the crowds and thus climbed this very tree to get a better view. Seeing this, Jesus asked the tax collector if he could visit his home, a gesture that so moved Zacchaeus that he decided to dedicate himself to a life of charitable deeds.
          Many of Jericho’s sights are outside the city, making for good drives, hikes or cable car rides into the surrounding area. The best way to see these sites is to hire a driver for the day – 30NIS to 40NIS an hour is a fair price.
          The new tourist information centre in Jericho’s main square is an excellent place to stop at early in your visit. Staff speak fluent English and have a huge variety of information about sights and tours, as well as very useful maps of the area. It is open every day.
        
        oTel al-Sultan (Ancient Jericho)RUIN(adult/child 10/5NIS; h8am-5pm)
It is impossible not feel a sense of history strolling around the mounds and ruins at Tel al-Sultan, where remains of dwellings and fortifications dating back some 10,000 years have been unearthed. You will see what look like sand dunes and stairways (the oldest known stairways in the world); underneath, the layers of civilisation beneath go back even further into the mists of history. 
            
            
              The remains of a round tower, thought to date from 8000 BCE, indicates that Jericho was possibly the world’s first fortified city; legend has it that the tower withstood seven earthquakes. 
              Though a large portion of ancient Jericho remains unexcavated, Tel al-Sultan is an essential part of any trip to the city, and what has already been identified here is very well explained on signposts throughout the site.
            
          
        Mount of Temptation & Monastery of the QurantulRELIGIOUS(round trip 55NIS; h8am-9pm)
            
              It was on the Mount of Temptation where, so we’re told, Jesus resisted Satan after his 40-day fast in the desert. The Monastery of the Qurantul marks the spot where the Devil urged Jesus to make a loaf of bread out of a stone (Matthew 4:1–11). It's an incredible feat of engineering, cut into the cliff face with dramatic views over the Dead Sea to Jordan. 
            
            
              Opening times for the monastery are sporadic but as with all tourist attractions in Palestine it is best to go early – or at least a couple of hours before sunset. 
Note that the caretaker may lock the door if he is showing big groups around, so it is worth hanging around a few minutes if you find it closed. 
              Cable cars stop just before the monastery, and even the short climb up the stairs to the front gate can be a struggle in the midday heat. They sometimes stop running without notice, making for a sweaty 400m climb. The juice sellers and a couple of restaurants provide a good spot to catch your breath.
            
          
        Hisham’s PalaceRUIN(Khirbet al-Mafjar; admission 10NIS; h8am-6pm)
            
              A short drive north of Tel al-Sultan, this is a spot not to be missed. The sprawling winter hunting retreat of Caliph Hisham Ibn Abd al-Malik must have been magnificent on its creation in the 8th century, with its baths, mosaic floors and pillars – so much so that archaeologists have labelled it the ‘Versaille of the Middle East’. It was not fated to last, however – it was destroyed by an earthquake soon after its creation.
            
            
              The caretaker will direct you to a cinema, where you will be shown a 20-minute video on the history of the site, which gives much-needed perspective for a walk around the ruins. A high point is an amazingly well-preserved ‘tree of life’ mosaic in the entertaining room of the bathhouse. On one side of the tree two deer graze peacefully, while on the other a deer is attacked by a lion. There are various interpretations of the mosaic, including the struggle between good and evil, peace and war, as well as good versus bad governance.
Wadi Qelt & Nabi MusaHISTORIC SITE
            
              The steep canyon of Wadi Qelt links Jerusalem to Jericho and has a number of interesting religious sites along its course, as well as springs, plants and wildlife, and often breathtaking views over the mountains and desert. The whole canyon is hikeable, although it would take a full day, and even in the spring and autumn the heat can be intense. The key sites of the wadi are linked to the highway that connects Jerusalem with Jericho and the Dead Sea, and are well signposted in both directions.
              Beware of extreme heat in summer and flash floods in winter.
            
            
              The spectacular St George’s Monastery (9am to 1pm daily) is a must see in Wadi Qelt, built into the cliff face in the 5th century. Turn right off the access road and park in the car park, from where it is a steep 10-minute walk to the monastery – expect to be hassled by donkey-taxi vendors the entire way. The paintings inside the main chapel are worth the walk, and parts of the original mosaic floors are visible below perspex screens. Up another flight of stairs there is a beautiful cave chapel.
              Drinking water is available at the monastery. You’ll see signposts along the way for the three main springs (Ein Qelt, Ein Farah and Ein Fawwar) but don’t drink the spring water. 
              Another road off the highway towards Jericho will take you to the complex of Nabi Musa (Prophet Moses; 8am till sunset). About 10km north of the Dead Sea, this is where Muslims believe Moses (Musa in Arabic, Moshe in Hebrew) was buried. A 
mosque was built on the site in 1269, under Mamluk Sultan Baybar (it was expanded two centuries later) and annual week-long pilgrimages set out from Jerusalem to Nabi Musa – they continue today. The road beyond the mosque takes you past a Muslim graveyard – including the tomb of a former imam of Nabi Musa, sadly today covered in graffiti – and then into the Judean desert for some 20km. The road passes solitary camels, abandoned tanks and vast open desert.
            
          
        Qasr al-YahudRELIGIOUS(h9am-4pm Apr-Oct, 9am-3pm Nov-Mar)
            
              At an isolated spot on the Jordan River, on the border between Jordan and the West Bank, stands the reputed spot of Jesus’s baptism by John (Matthew 3), which began his ministry. John was based here because it was an important crossroads for passing traders, business people and soldiers, but the same cannot be said of the site today. It was only reopened to pilgrims in 2011; you must pass an Israeli checkpoint and drive through a deserted landscape surrounded by barbed wire and minefields to reach a car park, from where it is a short walk down to the river. 
            
            
              Expect to see dozens of pilgrims, most in white T-shirts or smocks, taking turns in walking to the water and submerging themselves. The Jordan River is divided in the middle by a piece of wood – which denotes the border and prevents people from wading to the other side. Just metres away, armed Jordanian soldiers loll on a bench, facing their Israeli counterparts. Whether you are religious or not, it is a beauti
ful spot, and the site has been fully renovated with changing facilities, a gift shop, a food and drink outlet and shaded areas where you can sit and admire the view.
            
          
        Inn of the Good SamaritanHISTORIC SITE(adult/child 21/9NIS; h8am-5pm Apr-Oct, 8am-4pm Nov-Mar)
            
              Located just off the main road between Jerusalem and Jericho, this site is associated with the popular parable told in Luke 10: 25-37. In the story, Jesus describes a man who is robbed, beaten and left for dead on the road between Jerusalem and Jericho. A priest passes by and then a Levite but neither lends a hand to the stricken traveller. Finally, a Samaritan stops to help the stranger, dressing his wounds and bringing him to a nearby inn; thus ‘good Samaritan’ became a byword for ‘compassionate individual’. 
            
            
              Historians suggest that an Israelite rather than a Samaritan was the original hero of the story, and that a Greek translator mistakenly swapped the words while compiling the book of Luke.
              Archaeologists have unearthed a Second Temple-era palace, presumably constructed by Herod, which may have been converted into the inn mentioned in the Bible. A church was added under the Byzantines, and during the Crusader period a khan (travellers inn) was erected. The ruins you can see today are a confection of foundations and mosaics from the different eras of construction. Also on the site is a new Israeli museum housing a collection of mosaics.
Jericho Cable CarCABLE CAR(www.jericho-cablecar.com; 60NIS; h8am-8pm)
            
              The Swiss-made red cable cars that ply the route between Tel al-Sultan and the Mount of Temptation are visible from throughout Jericho. Although they may appear dated, the 20-minute ride is a great way to see the city and the farms that dominate its outskirts. Even when the site is quiet, cars leave fairly regularly. 
            
            
              Look out for the network of irrigation ditches that intersect the groves growing bananas and oranges, a technique used in this city for thousands of years. 






Hebron 
      %02  /  Pop 183,000
      
        
          For Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, Hebron (Al-Khalil in Arabic) is considered the cradle of organised religion. For thousands of years the major holy site has been the Tomb of the Patriarchs – the collective tomb of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, along with their wives (except Rachel). In addition, Islamic tradition states that Adam and Eve lived here after being exiled from the Garden of Eden. Sadly, the common thread of beliefs has done little to improve relations between the major monotheistic religions, and Hebron has long been the location of religious violence.
          What distinguishes Hebron from other Palestinian towns is the presence of Jewish settlers within the city centre. There are five microsettlements there, with other, larger ones on the outskirts, effectively dividing the city into two pieces. Many streets are barricaded and/or off limits to Palestinians. There are also regular flare-ups between Israeli soldiers – of 
which there are thousands stationed in the city – and Palestinian youths, particularly on Fridays.
          The murder of three Israeli teenagers kidnapped outside a settlement near Hebron in 2014 brought the city back into the limelight, with the two men accused of the killing – both said to be members of Hamas – later killed in an Israeli raid on a Hebron house. These events had followed months of raids, riots and arrests in the city as well as renewed settler activity, with hardline Israeli settlers occupying a new building in an Arab neighbourhood for the first time in decades.
          The security situation in Hebron has created palpable tension and the city remains fairly unstable. Obviously, if you see a situation developing – particularly around Al-Manara Sq – go the other way. Hiring a local guide can help explain the situation in the city, but be aware that Palestinian guides probably won’t be allowed in settler areas. If you arrive independently, expect local kids to offer you a tour, but agree on the price before you set off.
          Despite its woes, Hebron continues to flourish as a business leader among Palestinian communities. Situated on a former trade route to the Arabian Peninsula, the city is celebrated for its grapes, its skilled traders and its artisans’ production of blown glass, leather and hand-painted pottery, just as it has been since antiquity.
        
      
      
        History
According to the Hebrew Bible, Hebron was founded around 1730 BCE, its biblical name, Kiryat Arba (the Village of Four), perhaps referring to its position on four hills on which four Canaanite tribes settled.
          For the few centuries before the 20th, Hebron had been home to a small Jewish community, but in 1929, Arab nationalists attacked the city’s Jews – all of them non-Zionist ultra-Orthodox – and killed 67 of them. The rest of the community fled.
          After 1967, Orthodox Jews returned to the city, and a prominent feature of today’s Hebron is the presence of Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish enclaves – populated by some of the West Bank’s most hardline settlers – in the town centre. The suburb of Kiryat Arba, now home to more than 7000 Jews, was established nearby.
          In 1994, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and on the Jewish holiday of Purim, Brooklyn-born physician Baruch Goldstein opened fire on Palestinians while they prayed in the Ibrahimi Mosque, killing 29 men and boys and injuring a further 200. Moderate settlers, like the average Israeli, view Goldstein as a cold-blooded killer. However, extremist Jewish settlers, who see local Palestinians as foreign interlopers in the Land of Israel, consider him a hero and his gravesite remains a popular place of pilgrimage.
        
      
      
        1Sights & Activities
        
          For most travellers, there are three main parts to Hebron. The first is Ras al-Jora (Jerusalem Sq), set 
on Hebron Rd (also known as Shari’a al-Quds) as it comes in from Bethlehem. The area is a commercial hub with plenty of restaurants and workshops that produce glass and ceramics.
          About 3km further, Hebron Rd becomes Ein Sarah St, which eventually runs into Al-Manara Sq (really just an intersection). From Al-Manara Sq, turn right for about 200m, to reach the bus station, or turn left and walk for 10 minutes to reach Bab al-Zawieh, the entrance to the Old City souq and further to the Ibrahimi Mosque.
          The Jewish section of town lies south of the Old City, beyond high walls and barbed-wire fences. You can easily walk there from the Ibrahimi Mosque/Tomb of the Patriarchs. You can also cross at the checkpoint at Al-Manara Sq. Have your passport handy to cross through checkpoints between the Arab and Jewish parts of town.
          Hebron is not an easy place to visit by anyone's standards. It feels notably more tense than any other area of the West Bank, and fending off the myriad stall holders and touts plying their trade in the souk can be draining. At the same time, a visit is crucial for anyone wishing to understand the root of the settlement issue. The best way to visit the city – as with any politically sensitive area – is on an organised tour.
        
        Ibrahimi Mosque/Tomb of the PatriarchsMOSQUE, SYNAGOGUE(h8am-4pm Sun-Thu, except during prayers)
The focal point of Hebron for most visitors is the Tomb of the Patriarchs (Cave of Machpelah), known to Muslims as the Ibrahimi Mosque (Ibrahim is the Arab name for Abraham). The site is sacred to both Muslims and Jews – be  aware of the strict security and separate prayer spaces for each.
              When entering the mosque, you will be asked to remove your shoes, and women will be handed a head covering. 
            
            
              Looking rather like decorated tents, the mostly Mamluk-era cenotaphs commemorate the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and their wives, but it’s the cave below that both Jews and Muslims believe was chosen by Abraham as the actual final resting place of his family.
              You can peer into the cave through a metal grate in the corner of the mosque. As you walk into the room that allows viewing of the cenotaph of Abraham, note the small niche near the door where you can see a footprint. The Muslims believe this to be Mohammed’s footprint while Jews say Adam created it.
              Built by Herod (notice the Herodian stones at the base of the walls), the complex was altered by the Byzantines in the 6th century – they added a church, beside which a synagogue was built. When the Arabs conquered the area in the following century, the church was converted to a mosque but the synagogue remained intact. After the Crusaders left the scene, the Mamluks built another mosque.

Old CityARCHITECTURE
            
              The Old City’s stunning, often crumbling, Mamluk-styled Ottoman architecture includes a souq, but merchants have been moved to an outdoor area due to friction with Jewish settlers. Look out for the nets hung over the narrow streets to catch trash thrown from the upstairs windows (home to settlers) at the Palestinian shops below. You can also peer through the barbed wire at Hebron's gold souk, once renowned throughout the region but now completely off limits, with the doors to the shops welded shut during the Second Intifada. 
            
            
              For shops and food, it generally makes sense to head away from the Tomb of the Patriarchs, where more of the stalls are open.
            
          
        Glass & Ceramic workshopsARTS CENTRE
            
              At the northern entrance to Hebron, in the area called Ras al-Jora, several traditional blown-glass and ceramic factories are open for viewing and shopping. Al-Natsheh and Al-Salam glass factories receive visitors and shoppers, as does the smaller Tamimi Ceramics. All are open between 9am and 7pm daily except during Friday-morning prayers.

          Hebron doesn’t boast many top-notch culinary choices, though there are plenty of places for a quick, tasty bite on the go, particularly along Nimra St.

Nablus 
      %09  /  Pop 126,000
      
        
          Situated in and around a lush spring valley between Mt Gerizim (Jarzim in Arabic) and arid Mt Ebal, Nablus (known as Shechem in Hebrew) has historically been a significant exporter of olive oil, cotton, soap and carob. Best known these days for its olive-oil soap factories, olive-wood carving and kunafeh (a warm, syrupy cheese-based pastry), the city is layered with millennia of plunder and glory.
          Nablus is a bustling, exciting and vibrant metropolis, with a stunningly beautiful Old City that even rivals Jerusalem's – not least because of the lack of tour groups clogging its narrow alleyways. Nablus is also a hotbed of Palestinian activism, and more often than not its central square is covered in flags, banners and posters of martyrs, those killed in the decades-long struggle against Israel.
          The northern West Bank is still known to Jews as Samaria, from which the term ‘Samaritan’ is derived. Among the most fascinating elements of the Nablus area is its tiny Samaritan community, set on Mt Gerzim and overlooking the city.
        
      
      
        History
        
          After the 12 tribes of Israel split into two rival kingdoms in the 10th century BCE, Shechem was briefly the capital of the northern faction, ie of the 10 tribes who would eventually be lost to history.

In 70 CE the Romans obliterated ancient Shechem and set up Flavia Neapolis (New City), whose name the Arabs would later pronounce as Nablus. Graeco-Roman cults developed, only to be destroyed in 636 CE when the city was conquered by Arab forces. Christian shrines were converted to Muslim mosques, and Nablus developed the character it still displays today. The Old City dates back to Ottoman times, though relics from as long ago as the Roman occupation can still be spotted.
          Nablus is now surrounded by some of the West Bank’s most hardline Jewish settlements. On nearby hilltops you’ll see Bracha, Itamar, Yitzhar and Elon Moreh, often in the news because local Jewish extremists have clashed either with Palestinians or with Israeli soldiers.

              The focal point for visitors to Nablus is Al-Qasaba (Casbah or Old City), where you’ll find an Ottoman-era rabbit warren of shops, stalls and pastry stands, spice sacks and vegetable mounds. Amid the clamour, you’ll find dozens of contemplative mosques, including the Al-Kebir Mosque (Great Mosque), which is built on the site of an earlier Crusader church and Byzantine and Roman basilicas. Bits and pieces of its earlier incarnations have survived; look 

out for the huge columns and capitals, traces of the Byzantine structure.

              Near the entrance to Balata (population 20,000), the largest United Nations Relief and Works Agency refugee camp in the West Bank, you’ll find the spot where Christians believe a Samaritan woman offered Jesus a drink of water, and that he then revealed to her that he was the Messiah (John 4:13–14). 
              A Byzantine church destroyed in the Samaritan revolt of 529 CE was replaced by a Crusader church, which itself fell into ruins in the Middle Ages. The current church, St Photina the Samaritan, was built in the 1860s by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate.

              About 300m southeast, a compound known as Joseph’s Tomb has in recent years been a source of considerable friction between Jews, who come here

It boasts some interesting ruins and an excellent – albeit tiny – museum.

              Located uphill from a village of the same name, Sebastiya is a collection of ruins that includes an amphitheatre (which once held 7000, making it the largest in Palestine) and a Byzantine church, built upon a site considered to be the grave of John the Baptist. In the mid-4th century the grave was desecrated and the bones were partly burned; surviving portions were taken to Jerusalem and later to Alexandria where they were interred at a Coptic monastery. Sebastiya is 11km from Nablus; a taxi with waiting time will cost around 100NIS.
            
            
              Sebastiya's old city has recently been restored and is a nice place to walk, and there are a couple of restaurants close to the ruins that cater to the tour buses that call in occasionally.

          DON'T MISSMOUNT GERIZIM جبل جرزيم הר גריזים
          
            The Samaritans (members of an ancient religion closely related to Judaism) believe that Mt Gerizim, which overlooks Nablus from the south, was not only the first piece of land ever created, but is also the land out of which Adam was made, the only place spared in the great flood, the place Abraham went to sacrifice his son Isaac (Judaism holds that this event took place on Jerusalem’s Temple Mount) and the location chosen by God for the Temple.
            One of the world’s last communities of Samaritans (there’s another in Holon, Israel) lives on the mountain. Learn more about their community at the excellent Samaritan Museum (%02-237 0249; samaritans-mu@hotmail.com; admission 15NIS; h9am-3pm Sun-Fri, 9am-1pm Sat), where an English-

speaking guide will show you a video and answer any questions you have about the Samaritans. From the museum, continue further down the main road to the Good Samaritan Center (h9am-4pm Sun-Fri, 9am-1pm Sat), which contains a library and information desk.
            After a short walk, take the left fork to reach the Platform (adult/student 22/19NIS; h9am-sunset daily), the ancient site of the Samaritan Temple. A guard will unlock the gate to let you inside and will give a brief tour of the site. Once at the top, you’ll see the lowered floor that Samaritans say was the foundation of their Temple, which was built in the 5th century BCE. It only survived about 200 years before being destroyed by the Maccabees (a Jewish rebel army) in 128 BCE. The remains of a church, first constructed in 475 CE, have also been found here. You can rent binoculars for an extra 10NIS.
            From the centre of Nablus, Mt Gerizim can be reached by taxi in around 10 minutes. It’s a 50NIS journey including wait time. Taxis have to wait outside the village at a military checkpoint, so be prepared to pay your driver in advance to keep them waiting.

          The northernmost city in the West Bank, Jenin is home to religious sites, a bustling souq, a unique performing-arts scene and the Arab-American University, but its isolation has traditionally left it off the tourist trail.
          That is starting to change, due to the opening of the Jalameh (Gilboa) Border Crossing, just 10km south of Afula, allowing easier access for travellers from Nazareth and Haifa.

THE LAST PALESTINIAN ZOO
          
            The city of Qalqilya, with its lush tree-lined boulevards demonstrating its proximity to the coast, feels very different than the dry and often arid cities of the northern West Bank – as well as than Israeli settlements and the separation wall, which surrounds it on most sides. Little surprise, perhaps, that this city was the first to vote Hamas into power in the local elections of 2006.
            Politics aside, Qalqilya is famous as the home of the last surviving zoo in Palestine, housed within the sprawling Qalqilya Park, which is also home to a space museum and a small theme park.
            A half dozen lions, black bears and various species of baboons sit idly in small green cages towards the rear of the park, as well as a sad looking hippo in just a couple of feet of water. It is also home to a spectacular, if a little cramped, aviary.
            That said, the conditions of the animals are not bad by Middle Eastern zoo standards, and head vet Dr Sami Khader's struggle to keep the park going through two intifadas and an ongoing Israeli blockade is commendable.
            Dr Sami – who was featured in Amelia Thomas’s book The Zoo on the Road to Nablus – is happy to greet foreign visitors; if he is absent, you can meet other staff members who speak English. Tickets are 7/5NIS for adults/children and Qalqilya can be reached via service taxi from Nablus. The park is open from 8am to midnight.

The Gaza Strip


Introduction 
        
          Gaza has been off the to-do list for travellers for some time – and for good reason. Israel has blockaded the tiny strip from land, air and sea since just after Islamist party Hamas took control in 2006, keeping Gaza's 1.8 million residents in and, with the exception of a handful of journalists, politicians and aid workers, the world out. Even if it were possible to visit Gaza, it would not be recommended: Hamas fought three wars with Israel between 2006 and 2014 and the strip remains unstable and dangerous. 
          At 45km long and 10km wide, Gaza is one of the most densely populated places in the world – but it remains desperately poor, with hundreds of thousands of people living either in ramshackle refugee camps or heavily bombed towns and cities. It doesn't need to be this way: literacy levels are upwards of 97% and its seas hold untapped natural gas reserves worth up to US$7 billion. Its historic sites go back three millennia and it is home to one of the most beautiful coastlines in the Mediterranean. 
          At the end of 2014, billions were pledged internationally to rebuild the strip, but it was difficult to see how any serious change could take place while the blockade continues and while many Palestinian militants remained committed to establishing a Palestine 'from the river to the sea' (the Jordan to the Mediterranean) – leaving little room for their Israeli neighbours.

			History
      
        Commerce & Conquerors
        
          Settlement in Gaza is thought to date back to the Bronze Age, when it was used by the ancient Egyptians as a centre of trade. As far back into antiquity as 1500 BCE, an inscription on the Egyptian Temple of Amun at Karnak noted that Gaza was ‘flourishing’. 
          By the time Alexander the Great arrived, in 332 BCE, the land had already passed through the hands of the Philistines, the Israelites (under Kings David and Solomon), the Assyrians and the Persians. In 63 BCE Gaza became part of the Roman province of Judea (later named Syria Palaestina) and was gov
		  
		  
erned by a diverse 500-man senate. In the late 4th century, the Bishop Porphyrius forced Gazans to convert to Christianity and burned down the pagan Temple of Marna to replace it with a church.
          Islam arrived in 635 CE, turning churches into mosques, a process that was briefly reversed in 1100 by the Crusaders, who built a cathedral that now forms part of the Great Mosque. During the 14th century, Mamluk rule came to Gaza but the population dwindled due to a deadly plague in the 1340s. In 1516 Ottoman Empire rule began, lasting until the British arrived in 1917.
        
      
      
        Withdrawal & War
        
          During WWI, the British air force under General Edmund Allenby pounded Gaza while taking Palestine from the Turks, reducing much of the city to rubble. Then, in 1927, a huge earthquake finished off much of what was left standing after the war.
          Gaza was under British Mandate administration until 1948 when, with the creation of the State of Israel, Palestinian refugees flooded into the area, swelling its population from 35,000 to 170,000 in a matter of months. Egypt immediately responded to the declaration of Israel’s independence in 1948 by occupying Gaza. During the occupation housing projects were expanded but after President Nasser closed the Straits of Tiran in 1967, the Six Day War began and Israel took control of Gaza.
          Israeli settlers arrived in the 1970s and growing tensions ignited Palestinian activism and riots. The radical Islamic organisation Hamas was formed in 

1987 and the First Intifada began. A brief period of calm followed the Oslo Peace Accords and in 1994 the Palestinian Authority (PA) assumed administrative control of parts of Gaza. But talks to transfer permanent control to the PA failed and a Second Intifada began in September 2000, causing a series of Hamas suicide bombings and IAF strikes.
          Under international pressure and in a bid to improve Israel’s home security, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered Israel’s disengagement from Gaza and removed all of the strip's 21 Jewish settlements, with their 8000 inhabitants, in August 2005. Afterwards, a power struggle within Palestinian ranks began, culminating in the victory of Hamas in the January 2006 PA elections and the subsequent withdrawal of much international aid.
          In June 2006, Israel Defence Forces soldier Gilad Shalit was kidnapped at the Gaza–Israel border. Several days afterwards, Israel launched ‘Operation Summer Rains’, a series of attacks that killed some 280 Palestinian militants and more than 100 Palestinian civilians. In 2007 violent clashes broke out within Palestinian ranks as Hamas took control from Fatah.
          Meanwhile, from 2005 to 2008, thousands of Kassam and Grad rockets and mortars were fired on southern Israel from within Gaza, culminating in 87 rockets in just 24 hours on 24 December 2008. In response, Israeli forces launched ‘Operation Cast Lead’ by air and then by land. The Gaza War resulted in the deaths of more than 1400 Palestinians, with thousands made homeless. Israel lost 10 sol

diers and three civilians. Many NGOs declared a humanitarian crisis and Israel declared a ceasefire after three weeks of fighting.
        
        
          ACCESS TO GAZA
          
            Gaza is inaccessible to all but a tiny minority of journalists and aid workers. The foreign ministries of most countries advise against all nonessential travel to the strip. As a result of the 2014 Hamas–Israel war, Lonely Planet was unable to visit Gaza during our research trip to Israel and the Palestinian Territories.  
            Both Israel and Hamas – or, often, more extreme elements in Gaza – routinely break ceasefire agreements, the former with its controversial targeted assassinations of senior militants and the latter through rocket attacks, which often provoke Israeli air strikes. 
            Foreign journalists and aid workers have been killed in recent years while working in Gaza, including an Italian activist who was kidnapped and mur

dered by an Islamist group in 2011 and an Associated Press cameraman who was killed by unexploded Israeli ordinance while reporting on the aftermath of the 2014 war. 
            The Israeli authorities have made it clear that they will prevent any vessels from breaching the naval blockade, so participating in any sort of protest flotilla is not advised. In 2010, an Israeli commando raid on a Turkish protest ship aiming to land in Gaza left nine dead, with a 10th activist dying in hospital four years later after a protracted coma. 
            International journalists and aid workers who want to enter Gaza not only need to gain permission from Israel, but also from Hamas, who control the entry and exit of reporters on the other side of the formidable Erez crossing. On the occasions when the border at Rafah from Egypt is open, this crossing is a long, complicated and often dangerous process, not least because of the ongoing instability in Sinai. 
          
        
      
      
        Recent Events
        
          In 2011, kidnapped soldier Shalit was handed over as part of a prisoner swap that saw 1027 Palestinians released from Israeli jails. The deal was a major coup for Hamas, increasingly unpopular in Gaza due to ongoing economic malaise. The Islamist party got a further boost in June 2012 with the election of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohammed Morsi in Egypt. As the flow of goods through tunnels that linked the strip with Sinai surged, Gaza experienced a rare period of economic growth. 
          But the boom, like Morsi's government, was to be short-lived. 

On 10 November 2012, a mortar fired from Gaza hit an Israeli military jeep, wounding four soldiers, and a retaliatory Israeli air strike killed four Palestinian teenagers while they played football. The killings provoked dozens of rockets which, in turn, led to Israel's assassination of Hamas military commander Ahmed Jabari. By the time Egypt was able to negotiate a ceasefire on 21 November, more than 100 Gazans had been killed and almost 1000 wounded. 
          Rebuilding Gaza's shattered infrastructure in the wake of the war was easier than in 2009 due to Hamas's Egyptian allies as well as significant financial aid from Qatar. But the coup that overthrew Morsi and installed the Egyptian military in Cairo in July 2013 was a hammer blow for Hamas, as the tunnels were gradually dismantled and the Rafah border once again slammed shut. As the year rumbled on, Hamas's popularity in Gaza once again began to wane. 
          In early 2014, with both Hamas and Fatah in the West Bank facing rising anger for their failure to improve the lives of Palestinians in either territory, the two parties signed a unity deal ending their seven-year split. Although welcomed internationally, the deal was greeted with horror by Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who accused Abbas of choosing Hamas over peace with Israel. 
          At the end of April, peace negotiations between Israel and the PA – doomed for some time – finally broke down. By the time war broke out between Israel and Hamas in June 2014, relations between Israelis and Palestinians were at their lowest ebb 

since the Second Intifada (2001–05). Over the next 50 days, 73 Israelis and more than 2100 Palestinians would be killed and tens of thousands made homeless, while the limited infrastructure that Gaza had been able to develop was levelled by Israeli air strikes. As 2014 came to a close, Gaza's future looked bleaker than ever. 
        
      
    
    
      GAZA IN PEACETIME 
      
        Gaza does not feel like the rest of the Palestinian Territories – the traffic-snarled streets and general aura of chaos are more reminiscent of Cairo than Ramallah – but even in peacetime the strip is an intensely political place. It is not unusual to see armed militants at pro-Hamas rallies, while the first rocket Hamas fired at Tel Aviv in 2012 is memorialised in a monument on one of Gaza City's main thoroughfares. Many homes are riddled with shrapnel and bullet holes, and posters of 'martyrs' killed in the fighting with Israel are ubiquitous. 
        That said, life goes on for most Gazans. They are an incredibly young population: over 43% are under 14 and the whole population has a median age of 18 (compared to 40 in most European nations). While much attention is paid to their attendance at the 

infamous 'Hamas summer camps' (where children barely out of nappies pose with machine guns and go through military drills), most young Gazans dream of being entrepreneurs, business people and journalists rather than militants. 
        The strip is football-mad, home to some 30 domestic clubs and dozens of beachfront shisha bars that show European games late into the night. Like many other Arab countries, and Israel, most Gazans are either die-hard fans of Real Madrid or Barcelona, and when the two clubs meet the atmosphere is electric. 
        Gaza is home to a small surf club, although the inability to smuggle  more than a handful of haggard boards from Egypt has hindered its growth. But it is at the beach where Gaza really comes to life in peacetime. In the evenings, mothers clad in long black robes bathe toddlers in the shallows, families huddle in tents and the local kids scream and play in the booming surf. At these moments, Gazans can get a glimpse of what life was like before the wars, the hatred and the violence, and what, insh'allah (God willing), it will one day be again. 
      
    
    
      1Gaza Today
      
        For over a decade Gaza has been a byword for conflict and hardship, and though the strip has had periods of optimism and even growth in that time, in 2014 it was difficult to see an end to this dark period of its long history. 
        Even veteran Gaza-watchers were shocked at the range and ferocity of the rockets that Hamas had stockpiled and then fired during the 50-day war in 2014, as well as the complex network of tunnels it 

had built, some of which led into Israel and had been used to attack and kill Israeli soldiers. Equally, the fierceness  of the Israeli response and massive civilian casualties in Gaza brought condemnation from across the world, with thousands-strong protests in European cities, the US and even Israel itself, where citizens took to the streets in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa.
        As 2014 ended, the situation in Gaza seemed to be little changed – except that one hundred thousand of its people were now homeless and its infrastructure largely non-existent. Although Hamas made wide-reaching demands during peace negotiations in Cairo, it was only able to secure a meagre extension to the fishing zone off Gaza's coast – quite a price, many Palestinians argued, for the more than 2100 who died. Its demands for an end to the blockade and permission to build a port and airport were shelved for future talks in Cairo – at the time of writing these had failed to materialise. 
        It may be optimistic to think that the massive media coverage of the war could help prevent the outbreak of further conflict, but the fact remains that the 2014 Hamas–Israel war was easily the most-covered yet. Dozens of journalists inside Gaza produced often-harrowing reports from the battles, such as that in the Gaza City neighbourhood of Shejaiya, in which 120 Palestinians (a third of them women and children) and 13 Israeli soldiers were killed. Meanwhile social media was abuzz with Gazans tweeting as their buildings were under fire, giving a whole new reality to the war. 

The impact on Israel also suggests that hopes for peace are over-optimistic. Although there were anti-war protests inside Israel, the regularity and range of Hamas rockets was such that even many liberal Israelis got behind the war effort. In liberal Tel Aviv, residents were shocked by the almost constant barrage of rockets, and although most were shot down by Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system, a handful landed inside the city for the first time. Even Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, a staunch right-winger, began to look moderate in the face of some of the comments from his cabinet members, some of whom urged an even harsher military response and even a re-occupation of the strip. 
        A 2014 report published in the Arab Journal of Psychiatry claimed that more than half of 15- to 18-year-olds in Gaza suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, while UNRWA reports that more than 100,000 people were homeless. The tragedy remains that, beyond the aspirations and rhetoric of leaders on both sides, and the violence it inevitably leads to, Gaza and its people continue to live lives shattered by violence. 
      
    
    
      1Reconstruction Efforts
      
        At a summit in Cairo in October 2014, international donors promised US$5.4 billion for rebuilding Gaza following the war, with Qatar alone promising US$1 billion and the US offering US$212 million. The EU put forward US$568 million. The United Nations Relief and Work Agency had called for donations of 

US$1.6 billion – the biggest sum it had ever sought to raise, claiming that even before the war Gaza had a shortage of 75,000 homes, as well as deficient water, sewage and power infrastructure. 
        Of course, the commitment of funds was only the beginning of a long and uncertain process of reconstruction. Israel has restricted the importation of construction materials to Gaza since Hamas took power, arguing that they are used to construct tunnels and weapons depots. Reconstruction will also rely on renewed cooperation between Hamas and Fatah, which controls the Palestinian Authority. Improved relations with Egypt will also be crucial to allow import of materials through the Egypt-Gaza border.
      
    
    
      Gaza City
      
        The exact meaning of the name Gaza has been obscured through time. The ancient Egyptians called it Ghazzat (‘the prized city’) and, as one of the oldest functioning cities in the world, Gaza has always been considered a treasure for invaders and emperors.
        Gaza City is based around the long Omar al-Mukhtar St, which runs north to south from the sea to the main Salah ad-Din St. At the southern end of Omar al-Mukhtar, the town’s main focus is Palestine Sq. At the opposite end, the Rimal (Sands) area of town has the city’s beaches and some hotels. Directly to the east of Rimal is the Beach Refugee Camp, also called the Al-Shati Camp.

Elsewhere in the Gaza Strip
      
        Khan Younis
        
          Once a stopping point on the ancient trade route to Egypt, Khan Younis is primarily a market town and is Gaza’s second-largest urban centre. It incorporates the neighbouring Khan Younis refugee camp, home to around 72,000 people. The ruined khan in the square nearby – from which the town got its name – dates back to 1387, and was built by the Mamluks.
        
      
      
        Rafah
        
          Rafah was traditionally the gateway between Egypt and the Middle East. It became infamous in 2011 for its subterranean network of tunnels – the main route for goods and weapons into Gaza. According to the United Nations Relief and Work Agency, 99,000 people live in the Rafah and Tall-as-Sultan refugee camps, which are no longer distinguishable from Rafah town.

          The lowest place on the face of earth, the Dead Sea (428m below sea level) brings together breathtaking natural beauty, compelling ancient history and modern mineral spas that soothe and pamper every fibre of your body. The jagged bluffs of the Judean Desert, cleft by dry canyons that turn into raging tan torrents after a cloudburst, rise from the cobalt-blue waters of the Dead Sea, heavy with salt and oily with minerals. In oases such as Ein Gedi, year-round springs nourish vegetation so lush it’s often been compared to the Garden of Eden. Atop the bluffs lies the arid moonscape of the Judean Desert; down below, human beings have been at work for millennia, building Masada and Qumran (where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found) in ancient times and, more recently turning their hands to creating hiking trails, bike paths, kibbutzim, luxury hotels and even a world-famous botanic garden.

      History
      
        Awareness of the Dead Sea’s unique qualities goes back to at least the 4th century BCE; luminaries such as Aristotle, Pliny and Galen all made mention of the sea’s physical properties. The Nabataeans collected 


bitumen from the surface of the water and sold it to the Egyptians, who used it for embalming.
        For most of history, though, the Dead Sea – today shared by Israel, the West Bank and Jordan – has been regarded as unhealthy and hence shunned; popular lore had it that no bird could fly over its waters without dropping from the sky. This made the area a favoured retreat of religious ascetics and political fugitives: the future King David, King Herod, Jesus and John the Baptist are all said to have taken refuge along its shoreline or in nearby mountains and caves.
        Because it was seen as the ‘Sea of the Devil’, the area remained uncharted until it was finally explored by a team from the United States Navy in 1848. The Palestine Potash Company (now the Dead Sea Works) was established in 1930 by Moshe Novomeysky, a Siberian-born engineer and Zionist pioneer. The 1948 war left Israel with a quarter of the Dead Sea’s shoreline and Jordan with the rest. Israel captured the lake’s northwestern shore in 1967.
      
    
    
      1Geography
      
        The Dead Sea (Yam HaMelach, ie the Salt Sea, in Hebrew; Bahr al-Mayit, ie Sea of the Dead, in Arabic), whose surface is now about 428m below sea level, is the lowest point on the face of the earth. Connected to the Mediterranean Sea until about two million years ago, it forms part of the 6000km-long Great Rift Valley (Syrian-African Rift), which stretches from Syria south to Mozambique and includes the Sea of Galilee and the Red Sea.
About 65km long and 18km across at its widest point, the Dead Sea is fed mainly by the Jordan River, and supplemented by underground springs, seasonal wadis and flash floods. With no outlet, the in-flow has historically been balanced, more or less, by evaporation. Water arrives with normal mineral concentrations (mainly magnesium, sodium, calcium and potassium chlorides) – but, over the millennia, evaporation has removed vast quantities of H²O but left behind everything else, causing mineral concentrations in the lake to rise dramatically. The Dead Sea’s salt concentration is about 34%, making it 10 times more saline than the ocean.
        Because some 95% of the water from the Jordan River basin is now diverted to agriculture in Israel, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, the Dead Sea is drying up. Every year its surface drops by approximately 1m, and the shore, depending on its gradient, recedes by up to 5m. The Med-Dead Project, a plan to refill the Dead Sea by reconnecting it with the Mediterranean, generating electricity by taking advantage of the 400m drop, was proposed in the 1980s, but was eventually shelved. In 2013 an agreement was signed by Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority to build a 180km-long ‘Red-Dead Canal’ that would partly refill the Dead Sea with seawater from the Red Sea. Policy-makers, economists and environmentalists – such as Friends of the Earth Middle East (www.foeme.org) – are engaged in a spirited debate over the virtues and risks of the plan.
        The Dead Sea’s shores are dotted with springs and oases that provide water for 90 species of birds, 25 
species of reptiles and amphibians, and 24 species of mammals, as well as more than 400 species of plants, some of them at the extreme northern or southern edge of their natural distribution.
        These days the Dead Sea is in fact two separate lakes connected by an artificial channel. The larger northern basin (fronting Mineral Beach and Ein Gedi Beach) is a proper, if shrinking, lake whose deepest point is about 300m below the surface. The shallow southern section (fronting Ein Bokek) – actually an expanse of artificial evaporation pools – would be completely dry if not for the water pumped in by the Dead Sea Works. Whereas the level of the northern lake is dropping, that of the southern section is actually rising – to the point of threatening the Ein Bokek hotels – due to the accumulation of salt deposits on the bottom of the evaporation pools. The two lakes are separated by a peninsula that juts from the Dead Sea’s eastern shore and is known as HaLashon in Hebrew and Al-Lisaan in Arabic (both names mean ‘the Tongue’).




Ein Gedi
      %08  /  Pop 530
      
        
          Nestled in two dramatic canyons that plunge from the arid moonscape of the Judean Desert to the shores of the Dead Sea, Ein Gedi is one of Israel’s most magical desert oases. The area’s freshwater pools, cool streams, Eden-like waterfalls and luxuriant vegetation, fed by four year-round springs, are a haven for wildlife such as the majestic Nubian ibex (ya’el in Hebrew) and the boulder-dwelling hyrax (shafan sela in Hebrew; also known as a dassie or rock rabbit), both of which you’re very likely to encounter (the ibex is easiest to spot during the first and last hours that the reserve is open). Ein Gedi is the northernmost natural habitat of a number of plants that are more usually found on the savannahs of East Africa, thousands of kilometres south along the Great Rift Valley.
          Ein Gedi (literally ‘Spring of the Kid’, as in ‘young goat’) was first settled during the Chalcolithic Age (5000 years ago), when people just out of the Stone Age built a temple here. In the Bible, David fled to Ein Gedi to escape the wrath of Saul (I Samuel 23:29), and the oasis crops up again in the love poetry of the Song of Songs (1:14): ‘My beloved is to me as a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of Ein Gedi’. More recently, the erotic 
		  
		  waterfall scene in one of Brooke Shields' worst movies, Sahara (1983), was filmed at Ein Gedi.
        
      
      
        THE FOUR EIN GEDIS
        
          The area known as Ein Gedi stretches for 6km along Rte 90, with separate turn-offs (and bus stops) for the following spots (from north to south):
          
            Ein Gedi Nature Reserve – This is the turn-off to use for Wadi David, Wadi Arugot, the Ein Gedi Youth Hostel and the Ein Gedi Field School.
            Ein Gedi Beach – 1km south of the nature reserve.
            Kibbutz Ein Gedi – 3km south of the nature reserve (800m off Hwy 90).
            Ein Gedi Spa – 6km south of the nature reserve.

        oEin Gedi Nature ReserveNATURE RESERVE(%08-658 4285; www.parks.org.il)
            
              This reserve consists of two roughly parallel canyons, Wadi David and Wadi Arugot, each of which has its own entrance complex and ticket office.
              The key to a successful hike in the reserve is the excellent colour-coded map-brochure given out when you buy your ticket. It has invaluable details on the area’s many trails (indicated using the same colours as the trail markings), how long each route takes, and the times by which you need to begin and finish each circuit.
			  
Park rangers make sure that visitors do not enter the park before it opens or stick around after closing time (in theory, they can fine violators 730NIS). The reason: desert animals such as the wolf, jackal and fox need some people-less peace and quiet in order to search for food and drink (the reserve has the only year-round water sources in the entire area).
              The last time a critically endangered Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr) was spotted in the Ein Gedi area – carrying off Kibbutz Ein Gedi house pets for dinner – was in 2006. The species is now presumed to be extinct here.
              Eating, smoking and pets are not allowed in the reserve.

              These famous botanic gardens are home to a thousand species of indigenous and exotic plants, from near-mythological biblical species such as frankin

cense and myrrh to the highly poisonous Sodom apple, and from gargantuan baobab trees to tiny plants that can survive with minuscule quantities of water. Situated in Kibbutz Ein Gedi, 3km south of Ein Gedi Nature Reserve.

              This hugely popular but steep and unpleasantly stony public beach (bring flip-flops) fulfils the bare requirements of those seeking a Dead Sea float in that it has toilets and changing rooms (2NIS; 6am to 7pm or 8pm) and a 24-hour snack bar. Situated 1km south (a 20-minute walk) along Rte 90 from the Ein Gedi Nature Reserve turn-off.
            
          
        Wadi DavidHIKING(Nahal David; adult/child incl Ein Gedi Antiquities 29/15NIS; h8am-4pm or 5pm, last entry 1hr before closing)
            
              Ein Gedi Nature Reserve’s most accessible – and popular – pools and waterfalls are situated along Lower Wadi David (Nahal David Tachton), ie the area downstream from David’s Waterfall (Mapal David; one hour return). The entrance pavilion has bathrooms where you can change into your bathing suit, free lockers (ask staff for a key) and free cooled drinking water (if you don’t have an empty bottle, ask staff for one that’s on the way to being recycled). 
            
            
              The refreshments counter sells sandwiches, ice cream and drinks, including espresso.

To get to Upper Wadi David (Nahal David Elyon), which is significantly less crowded, head up the trail that climbs the south wall of the canyon. A bit past tiny Shulamit’s Spring (Ma’ayan Shulamit) is a T-junction: go right and you’ll head down the slope to the section of Wadi David above David’s Waterfall, including Dodim Cave (Lovers’ Cave); hanging a left takes you to a Chalcolithic Temple (3000 BCE), the pools of Ein Gedi Spring (most of whose mineral water is diverted and bottled by Kibbutz Ein Gedi) and, near the base of Wadi Arugot, an archaeological site known as Tel Goren (7th to 8th century BCE).
              Wadi David can get very crowded, especially on Jewish holidays and on days when raucous coach loads of schoolkids are around. The first 400m of the trail, to the first waterfall, are fully accessible to wheelchairs.

              Generally less crowded but no less lovely than Wadi David, Wadi Arugot offers a number of excellent trails, some of them quite challenging. The ticket office complex, a 20- to 30-minute walk or a five-minute drive from the Wadi David car park, has free lockers, a small refreshment counter with ice cream and cold drinks, and a shop that sells SPNI 1:50,000-scale trail maps.
            
            
              Hikers must leave the upper reaches of Wadi Arugot (Nahal Arugot), ie the area above the Hid

den Waterfall (HaMapal HaNistar), including the Upper Pools (HaBreichot HaElyonot), by 2pm (3pm during daylight savings time).
            
          
        Desert Plateau HikesHIKING
            
              The plateau above Ein Gedi – the eastern edge of the Judean Desert – is about 200m above sea level, ie 625m above the Dead Sea. Five trails head from Ein Gedi Nature Reserve up to the plateau and its spectacular panoramas, taking you well away from the madding crowds. 
            
            
              The reserve’s most difficult hike (six to eight hours), marked by black blazes, links Wadi Arugot with Wadi David via the Desert Plateau, Ein Gedi Lookout (Mitzpeh Ein Gedi) and Ein Gedi Spring. It should only be attempted by very experienced hikers.
              From north to south, the trails leading up to the plateau are the Yishay Ascent (from Ein Gedi Field School); the Ein Gedi Ascent (from Ein Gedi Spring, on the hillside between Wadi David and Wadi Arugot); Bnei HaMoshavim Ascent (an especially difficult route that begins at the upper section of Wadi Arugot); Ha’Isiyyim Ascent (from near the top of Wadi Arugot); and the Tzruya (Zeruya) Ascent (from near Kibbutz Ein Gedi).
              A 1:50,000-scale SPNI trail map, sold at the entrance to Wadi Arugot, is a must for all these routes, which are closed from about June to September because of the extreme heat. Park staff are happy to help with planning; before heading out, let them know your route.

              Owned by Kibbutz Ein Gedi, this spa is a popular place to catch a float and get coated with invigorating natural black mud. The shoreline has receded 1.2km since the spa opened in 1984 so beach-goers take a little train to the water’s edge. Wheelchair accessible. Situated 6km south of Ein Gedi Nature Reserve.
            
            
              The spa has six sulphur pools and a freshwater pool and offers a range of natural beauty and massage treatments. There’s also a coffee shop and a restaurant. 
            
          
        
          SAFE HIKING
          
            A few tips on staying safe and healthy in the Dead Sea’s unique climate and geography:
            
              ADon’t hike without a 1:50,000-scale SPNI topographical trail map (87NIS; not necessary at Ein Gedi unless you climb up to the plateau above the wadis). The maps to have – available only in Hebrew – are No 11 (Ein Gedi v’Daroma) for Ein Gedi and places south of there; and No 8 (Tzfon Midbar Yehuda v’Yam HaMelach) for Ein Gedi and points north. Both can be purchased at the Ein Gedi Field School and the Wadi Arugot entrance to Ein Gedi Nature Reserve.
              ABring along lots of water – at least 5L per person per day.
              ATo beat the heat of summer, hit the trail shortly after dawn. If you’re still out at midday, you’re 

unlikely to run into anyone other than ‘mad dogs and Englishmen’.
              AFlash floods can turn the dry canyons above the Dead Sea into raging torrents. In the late autumn, winter and spring, keep an eye on the weather reports and stay well away from narrow channels (eg those along Wadi Daraja) if there’s any chance of a cloudburst up in the Judean Desert.
              ATemperatures can drop precipitously at night so bring along a fleece jacket to avoid hypothermia in case you get stuck.
              AKeep away from areas (eg south of Ein Gedi Beach and across Rte 90 from Ein Gedi Youth Hostel) where signs warn of sinkholes (bol’anim), which can open under your feet with no warning and swallow you alive (yes, this has happened to people!). Caused by the dissolution of underground salt deposits, sinkholes have been found at 37 different sites around the Dead Sea; there are now several thousand of them up to 30m across and 25m deep, with hundreds more formed each year.
              AStay out of the area’s caves, all of which (including the famous Flour Cave) are closed to the public because various geological factors, including high salt content, make them susceptible to sudden collapse.




North of Ein Gedi
      %02
      
        
          Highlights along the Dead Sea’s northwestern coast include the Qumran Caves, where the Dead Sea 
Scrolls were discovered, and some wild, unspoilt nature sites. Captured by Israel from Jordan in 1967, this almost uninhabited corner of the West Bank is just a short drive from Jericho.
        
      
      
        Qumran National Park
        
          World-famous for having hidden the Dead Sea Scrolls for almost 2000 years, Qumran (%02-994 2235; www.parks.org.il; Rte 90; adult/child 29/15NIS, incl entry to Ein Feshkha 43/24NIS; h8am-4pm or 5pm Sat-Thu, 8am-3pm or 4pm Fri, last entry 1hr before closing) was the site of a small Essene settlement around the time of Jesus – specifically, from the late 1st century BCE until 68 CE, when it was destroyed by the Romans. The ruins are not that extensive, but from an elevated wooden walkway you can clearly make out the aqueduct, channels and cisterns that ensured the community’s water supply. Elsewhere are ritual baths (the Essenes were zealous about ritual purity); the refectory, in which communal meals were eaten; and the scriptorium, where some of the Dead Sea Scrolls may have been written. One of the caves where the scrolls were discovered can be visited on a two-to-three-hour walking circuit (not recommended in summer). The small museum and its seven-minute multimedia program will give you basic historical background. Wheelchair accessible.
          Qumran is a safe vantage point for watching wintertime flash floods. Walking from Qumran to Ein Feshkha takes about five hours one-way. Park HQ has a restaurant.

Qumran is 35km east of Jerusalem and 35km north of Ein Gedi. All Jerusalem–Dead Sea buses pass here.
        
        
          THE DEAD SEA SCROLLS
          
            Few discoveries in the history of archaeology have elicited as much enduring worldwide fascination as the Dead Sea Scrolls, accidentally found at Qumran in 1947 inside earthenware jars hidden in a cliffside cave by a Bedouin shepherd boy searching for a stray goat. Eventually, about 950 different parchment and papyrus documents written during the Second Temple period and the earliest years of Christianity (200 BCE to 68 CE) were found in 11 caves. Most of the documents, which include the oldest known manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible, texts that didn’t make it into the Bible and descriptions of life in Judea around the time of Jesus, are in Hebrew, some are in Aramaic and a few are in Greek. Many are in tiny fragments, making the pro

cess of reassembling and deciphering them long and arduous.
            The scrolls are believed to have belonged to the Essenes, a separatist, ascetic Jewish sect – mentioned by Josephus Flavius – that moved to the desert to escape the decadence they believed was corrupting their fellow Jews.
            The Israel Museum in Jerusalem, where some of the scrolls are on display, runs, with some help from Google, the Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Project (http://dss.collections.imj.org.il), which makes searchable, high-resolution digitised images of the scrolls available to the general public.
            For some interesting facts on the scrolls, see www.centuryone.com/25dssfacts.html.
          
        
      
      
        Ein Feshkha (Einot Tsukim)
        
          These spring-fed freshwater ponds and the lush greenery around them were a favourite holiday spot of Jordan’s King Hussein in the 1950s and 1960s. Today, the oasis and its veritable forest of salt-resistant plants, including tamarisks and reeds, are an agreeable place to spot birds and take a cooling dip, though the pools (open Friday and Saturday late March to November) can be crowded.
          There is no access to the rapidly receding Dead Sea shoreline – note the sign, some 4km from the water’s edge, reading ‘The sea was here in 1967’. However, you can see a Second Temple-period farm where the Essenes of Qumran apparently produced 

date wine and afarsimon oil and raised sheep and goats.
          The southern Hidden Reserve is off limits – for reasons of conservation – unless you join a one-hour guided tour (h9am & 1pm Fri & Sun Sep-Jun).
          Ein Feshkha is 3km south of Qumran. Thanks to the local geography, the site is never closed due to flash floods.

          Perched on a cliff 600m above the Dead Sea – the views are truly spectacular – this no-frills, hippyish holiday village (%08-622 2202, reservations 1-700-707 180; www.metzoke.co.il; dm huge tent 110NIS, d/q private tent 250/500NIS, d with bathroom 400-650NIS, basic q 400NIS; hreception 8am-8pm) is like a quick trip back to the 1970s, with bare-bones infrastructure, worn furnishings and very basic bathrooms. There are 50 basic rooms and hundreds of sleeping spots in large tents that can be subdivided to keep members of a family or group together.
          You can pitch your own tent for 50NIS per person (90NIS including an excellent Israeli breakfast). Sleeping bags can be rented for 30NIS. If you want to cook, bring your own food. Dinner is available for 95NIS (65NIS for kids aged three to 12 years). You must check in before 8pm. It's situated 18km north of Ein Gedi; a steep 5.5km up the hill (it may be possible to hitch) from the army roadblock on Rte 90, where you can ask any Jerusalem–Dead Sea bus to stop.

Wadi Daraja
        
          One of the more difficult hikes in the area, this steep canyon descent (five to six hours not including stops), known in Hebrew as Nahal Darga, requires you to climb down about two dozen waterfalls (30m climbing rope required) and swim across year-round pools up to 4m deep – all your kit will get wet so leave those mobile phones and cameras somewhere safe. Wear proper shoes (ones you don’t mind getting wet), not sandals. The minimum age is 10 years.
          The Israel Nature and Parks Authority has an information booth (www.parks.org.il; hFri, Sat & Jewish holidays Sep-Jun, daily Jul & Aug) right outside Metzukei Dragot, which is 1.5km from the trailhead; schematic maps are available there or at the Metzukei Dragot reception desk. Begin this hike no later than 9am (10am during daylight savings) – and don’t begin it at all if there’s any chance of rain in the Judean Desert. The bottom of the trail intersects Rte 90 near Kibbutz Mitzpe Shalem.
          Several circular, family-friendly hikes (which don’t require you to get soaked) start at the same point. These include the Wadi Tekoa Circuit (five hours) and the Mashash-Murba’at Circuit (three hours), which passes caves in which letters personally signed by Bar Kochba (leader of the Bar Kochba Rebellion of 132 to 135 CE) were found in 1952.

Mineral Beach
        
          Run by Kibbutz Mitzpe Shalem, this is one of the nicest of the Dead Sea beaches (%02-994 4888; www.dead-sea.co.il; adult/child 50/30NIS, on Sat 60/35NIS; h9am-5pm or 6pm Sun-Fri, opens 8am Sat). After having a float and glopping black mud onto your skin, you can soak in naturally sulphurous spring water (39°C) or indulge in a Tibetan or Swedish massage. Lockers and towels each cost 10NIS (plus a 10NIS deposit). Has a cafeteria and transport down to the receding water line. Wheelchair accessible. Camping is not permitted.
          Had you dropped by here on 18 September 2011, you would have seen more than a thousand completely nude Israelis being photographed by the artist Spencer Tunick.
        
      
    
    
      Masada
      %08
      
        
          After the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 70 CE, almost a thousand Jews – men, women and children – made a desperate last stand atop Masada (Metzada; %08-658 4208, 08-658 4207; adult/child 29/15NIS), a desert mesa surrounded by sheer cliffs and, from 72 CE, the might of the Roman Empire’s Tenth Legion. As a Roman battering ram was about to breach their walls, Masada’s defenders chose suicide over enslavement. When Roman soldiers swarmed onto 		  

		  the top of the flat-topped mountain, they were met with silence.
          Until archaeological excavations began in 1963, the only source of information about Masada’s heroic resistance and bloody end was Josephus Flavius, a Jewish commander during the Great Jewish Revolt (66 to 70 CE) who, after being captured, reinvented himself as a Roman historian. He writes that as the Roman siege ramp inched towards the summit, the defenders – Zealots known as Sicarii (Sikrikin in Hebrew) because of their habit of assassinating their (Jewish) rivals using a curved dagger (sica in Greek) hidden under their cloaks – began to set fire to their homes and possessions to prevent them falling into Roman hands. Ten men, who would have the task of killing everyone else, were then chosen by lot. Nine of the 10 were executed by one of their number before the last man alive committed suicide. When the Romans broke through everyone was dead – except for two women and five children, who had survived by hiding.
          Over the last century, Masada has become Israeli shorthand for the attitude that ‘they’ll never take us alive’. During WWII, before the British stopped Rommel’s German divisions at El Alamein (Egypt) in 1942, some Palestinian Jews made plans for a last stand atop Mt Carmel, and a number of Israeli army units hold their swearing-in ceremonies here, vowing that ‘Masada shall not fall again’. (Less apocalyptically, the Israeli air force has been known to send groups of officers up to do yoga at sunrise.)
		  
		  Masada has been a Unesco World Heritage Site since 2001. The entire site, except the Northern Palace, is wheelchair accessible.

              A really excellent introduction to Masada’s archaeology and history, this museum combines 500 evocative artefacts unearthed by archaeologists (and five replicas) with introductions to Masada personalities – eg Herod the Great, who built a palace here in the 1st century BCE, and Josephus Flavius – to make the dramatic events of 73 CE seem close enough to touch. Visitors receive an audio headset, available in seven languages.
            
            
              Objects on display include Roman arrowheads; a leather sandal once worn by a Roman legionnaire; the remains of Roman-era dates, wheat, barley and olives; and 11 pot shards that – as Josephus writes – may have been used to select those who killed everyone else as the Romans breached the ramparts.
            
          
        Atop MasadaARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE
            
              The plateau atop Masada, which measures about 550m by 270m, is some 60m above sea level – that is, about 488m above the surface of the Dead Sea. Visitors are given an excellent map-brochure of the
			  
ruins; similar information can be had from an audioguide (20NIS, including admission to the Masada Museum). Both are available – in Hebrew, English, French, German, Spanish and Russian – at the ticket windows, atop Masada and at the museum. 
            
            
              On the ruins, black painted lines divide reconstructed parts from original remains.
              Drinking water is available so bring a bottle to refill. Eating atop Masada is forbidden.
              Look down in any direction and chances are you’ll be able to spot at least one of the Romans’ eight military camps and their siege wall. The effort put into the siege by the Roman Legions is mind-boggling – no surprise, then, that they commemorated their victories over the rebels of Judea by erecting a monumental victory arch in the centre of imperial Rome, the Arch of Titus, whose design, many centuries later, inspired Paris's Arc de Triomphe.
            
          
        Sound & Light ShowLIGHT SHOW(%08-995 9333; adult/child 45/35NIS; h9pm Tue & Thu Mar-Oct)
            
              This dramatic, open-air recounting of the history of Masada is meant to be watched from the base of the Roman siege ramp on Masada’s western side. The narration is in Hebrew but you can rent earphones (15NIS) for simultaneous translation into five languages. Access is via Arad and then Rte 3199; from the Visitors Centre, it’s a 68km drive. Get there by 8.30pm.
            
          
        oTrails Around MasadaHIKING

Paths link the remains of the eight Roman military encampments that still encircle Masada, making it possible to circumnavigate the mesa in part or in full. To get a sense of the area's geography, check out the 3D relief map facing the Visitors Centre ticket windows.
            
            
              From the Visitors Centre, a trail heads west up Mt Eleazar to Camp H (30 minutes). From here, Roman legionnaires could peer down at Masada, gathering aerial intelligence on the Zealots’ activities. The path continues to the bottom of the siege ramp on Masada’s western side.
              Alternatively, you can walk north from the Visitors Centre, following the siege wall on a trail known as Shvil HaRatz (the Runner’s Trail). It, too, eventually goes to the siege ramp on the western side.
              Another trail links Camp D (north of Masada) with the eminently hikeable Wadi Tze’elim, 4km to the north.
            
          
        oSnake PathHIKING
            
              This famously serpentine footpath winds its way up Masada’s eastern flank, starting from near the Visitors Centre. Walking up takes about 60 minutes; count on spending 30 minutes to come back down. If you’d like to watch sunrise from the summit, get to the base an hour before the sun comes up, ie sometime between 4.30am (in June) and 5.30am (in December). Before 8am, access is from the security barrier near the youth hostel.

On particularly hot summer days, park authorities sometimes close the trail at 10am or 11am (9am when conditions are extreme) for the rest of the day.
            
          
        Ramp TrailHIKING
            
              The Romans wimped out and so can you – the path up the spine of their siege ramp takes only about 15 minutes to climb. The catch is that the ramp (ie western) side of the mountain is accessible only from the town of Arad, a 68km drive from the Visitors Centre via Rte 31 and then Rte 3199.
              If you’d like to watch sunrise from the summit, get to the base of the ramp half an hour before the sun comes up.

Ein Bokek
      %08
      
        
          Sandwiched between the turquoise waters of the southern Dead Sea and a dramatic tan bluff, Ein 

Bokek’s strip of luxury hotels is the region’s main tourist zone. Ein Bokek (also spelled En Boqeq) has the area's nicest free beaches, and is the Dead Sea’s main centre for treating ailments such as psoriasis, arthritis and respiratory conditions with naturally occurring minerals and compounds.
          The three most commonly heard languages here are Hebrew, Arabic and Russian – the area is hugely popular both with Israelis (Jews and Arabs) and Russians (immigrants and tourists).
          Unlike beaches further north, Ein Bokek fronts evaporation pools (kept full by Dead Sea Works pumps) rather than the open sea, which is why its lakeshore is not receding.
          There are no left-luggage facilities at Ein Bokek.
        
      
      
        SOOTHING & HEALTHFUL
        
          The waters of the Dead Sea contain 20 times as much bromine, 15 times more magnesium and 10 times as much iodine as the ocean. Bromine, a component of many sedatives, relaxes the nerves; magnesium counteracts skin allergies and clears the bronchial passages; and iodine has a beneficial effect on certain glandular functions – or so it’s claimed.
          If this were not enough, the Dead Sea’s extremely dense air – the area has the world’s highest barometric pressure – has 10% more oxygen than sea-level air. Other healthful properties, especially for people with breathing problems, include high temperatures, low rainfall, low humidity and pollen-free air.

The Dead Sea Medical Research Centre (www.deadsea-health.org), affiliated with Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, conducts scientific analyses of the sea’s health benefits.

Sights & Activities
        
          A 3km-long pedestrian promenade and occasional buses (5.80NIS) link Ein Bokek’s two hotel zones, Ein Bokek (the main, northern one) and Neve Hamei Zohar.
        
        oEin Bokek BeachBEACH(h24hr)F
            
              This broad, clean beach, in the middle of Ein Bokek’s main (northern) hotel zone, is gloriously sandy. It has lifeguards, shade shelters, beach showers, changing rooms and bathrooms (closed at night). Camping is permitted – this is a much more comfortable option than Ein Gedi Beach. Wheelchair accessible.
              As of 2014, the entirety of the Ein Bokek beachfront, including areas that once belonged to specific hotels, is open to the public, with access along a lovely, shaded promenade. Facilities such as beach chairs are still reserved for paying guests.
            
          
        Wadi BokekHIKING
            
              This is one of just three wadis on the Dead Sea’s western shore that are fed year-round by spring water (the other two are at Ein Gedi). The narrow gorges, lush vegetation and waterholes make for an easy and 

refreshing hour-long hike. Access is through a tunnel under Rte 90, between the David and Leonardo Inn Hotels – or you can park at the trailhead.
            
          
        Day SpasSPA
            
              Almost every Ein Bokek hotel boasts a spa with swimming pools, saunas, spa baths, a long menu of treatments and an army of predominantly Russian therapists. Most places charge non-guests 100NIS to 260NIS to use their facilities for the day, including beach chairs but not including special treatments. Some deals include lunch.
            
          
      
      
        SWIMMING SAFELY
        
          Staying safe while bobbing and paddling requires a bit more caution than at the sea shore.
          
            ADo not under any circumstances dunk your head! If water gets in your eyes, it will sting horribly and temporarily blind you. Do not thrash around – calmly get out of the water and ask someone to help you rinse your eyes under a tap or shower.
            ASwallowing just a few gulps of sea water – or inhaling it – is extremely dangerous and can even be fatal. Seek immediate medical attention (eg from lifeguards) if this happens.
            ADrink lots of potable water – not only will the heat dry you out, but the water of the Dead Sea is so saturated with minerals that it will suck out your body’s fluids like a thousand leeches. Remember what happened in high school physics class when you learned 

about osmosis by putting a slice of potato in saltwater?
            AThe Dead Sea can be so relaxing that some people don’t notice when westerly winds gently blow them out towards the middle of the lake (ie towards Jordan). Broadsheet readers are in special danger – a newspaper makes an excellent sail!




PREPARING FOR A DEAD SEA DIP
          
            The waters of the Dead Sea have some fantastic healing powers, but unless you respect their bromines and chlorides you may find yourself in significant pain – or even danger. As a result, a few preparations are in order before you slip into the slimy brine. First off, don’t shave the day before you swim or you may find out more than you’d like to know about the meaning of the phrase ‘to have salt rubbed into your wounds’. Other nicks and cuts – whether you realised you had them or not – are also likely to call attention to themselves.
            What to wear when swimming in the Dead Sea:
            
              ADo not wear jewellery – silver will turn jet black (don’t worry, it can be cleaned) and other metals (including gold that isn’t 24 carat) may also be affected.
              AWear waterproof sandals to protect your feet from sharp stones, both on shore and in the water, and from burning the soles of your feet on the sun-scorched sand.
            
            The Dead Sea’s dense, low-elevation air naturally filters the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays, making it much harder to get sunburnt than at sea level, despite scorching temperatures.


Sodom
      
        By tradition, this area is the site of Sodom and Gomorrah, the biblical cities that were destroyed in a storm of fire and brimstone, punishment from God because of their people’s depravity (Genesis 18-19). These days, Sodom is much better known for its desert hiking and cycling trails than for sodomy.
      
      
        1Sights & Activities
        ‘The Situation of Man’SCULPTURE(Rte 90)

Atop a bluff overlooking the Dead Sea Works stands this modern sculpture, a rusty steel column with old steel railway ties striving to climb it like desperate worms.
            
            
              Next to the sculpture, a viewpoint looks out over a crazy juxtaposition of smoke-spewing heavy industry, electric-blue evaporation pools, green farm fields (over in Jordan) and the wild, tawny beauty of the desert. Views are best in the late afternoon, when the setting sun turns the mountains of Moab a reddish gold.
              The 600m-long access road intersects Rte 90 250m north of the main entrance to the Dead Sea Works. Turn off at the white-on-brown sign reading 'Plant Viewing Point' (ignore the yellow ‘no trespassing’ sign) and follow the green signs marked (in Hebrew) 'LaMitzpeh' ('to the scenic lookout'). Beyond the sculpture, a 4WD road continues to the Amiaz Plateau.
            
          
        Lot’s WifeROCK FORMATION
            
              About 11km south of the southern end of Ein Bokek, high above the west side of Rte 90, a column of salt-rich rock leans precariously away from the rest of the Mt Sodom cliff face. It is popularly known as Lot’s Wife because, according to the Bible, Lot’s wife was turned into a pillar of salt as punishment for looking back to see Sodom as it burned (Genesis 19:17 and 19:26).
            
          
        Dead Sea WorksINDUSTRIAL COMPLEX(DSW; www.iclfertilizers.com; Rte 90)

Israel’s only major natural resource – other than sunlight and the gas fields off the Mediterranean coast – is the Dead Sea, from which products ranging from magnesium chloride and anhydrous aluminium chloride to table salt and cosmetics are extracted. Founded in the 1930s, the DSW is now the world’s fourth-largest producer of potash, an important component of agricultural fertiliser.
            
            
              By day, the rusty (from the salt air) smokestacks, pipes and holding tanks of the DSW complex look like a mid-20th-century industrial dystopia, but by night, when the sprawling facilities are lit by thousands of yellowish lights, the site has a mysterious, otherworldly beauty.
            
          
        Mt SodomHIKING, CYCLING
            
              Two trails head down the steep flanks of Mt Sodom from a lookout point, reachable by 4WD, whose views are at their best in the late afternoon. Ma’aleh HaSulamot (Ladders Ascent; 1½ hours to walk down), named after its many stairs, connects with Rte 90 across the highway from the sun-blasted huts of the Dead Sea Works’ first workers’ camp, built in 1934. 
            
            
              Another descent to Rte 90 is Shvil HaDagim (Fishes Trail; 1½ hours down), so named because of the many fossilised fish you can see in the rocks.
              Mt Sodom, 11km long and up to 2km wide, is one of the world’s stranger geological formations. Start with the fact that it’s made almost entirely of rock salt, a highly soluble material that in any other climate would have melted away. In fact, over the mil

lennia the area’s rare rainfalls have dissolved some of the salt, creating deep in the bowels of the mountain a maze of caves (closed to the public) up to 5.5km long. Many are connected to the surface by shafts that hikers need to make sure they don’t fall into, and some are filled with delicate, eerie salt stalactites. And then there’s the matter of Mt Sodom’s summit. A respectable 250m above the surface of the Dead Sea – the views of Jordan’s Moab Mountains are gorgeous – it also happens to be 176m below sea level.
              West of Mt Sodom, Wadi Sodom is ideal for mountain biking. If you start at the top (accessible by 4WD), it’s about two hours, mostly downhill, to the Neve Zohar area. A round-trip circuit that connects with beautiful Wadi Pratzim (Wadi Perazim), whose upper reaches pass the famous Flour Cave (closed to the public), is another option.

          Snuggled up against the Jordanian border in one of Israel’s most remote corners, this agricultural moshav is the perfect base for exploring the wadis, plateaus and bluffs around the southern Dead Sea. Tranquil and laid-back, Neot HaKikar and its sister moshav, Ein Tamar, have some mellow B&Bs and all sorts of options for mountain biking, hiking, birdwatching and exploring the desert by jeep. The nearest beach is 20 minutes away at Ein Bokek. Because of the intense summer heat, some places close from July to mid-September.
          The moshav’s main source of income is agriculture, with 70% of the produce destined for export. Crops – grown with the help of some 500 Thai farm-workers, in salty soil using saline well water – include red, green, yellow and orange peppers, winter-ripening vegetables and melons, and organic medjool dates. The latter are sorted using the world’s most advanced sorting machine: eight digital cam

eras take portraits from three angles of every single date, shuttled by air guns to this or that box according to a sophisticated algorithm. Back in the 1960s, Neot HaKikar was the site of some of the earliest experiments with modern drip irrigation.
        
      
      
        1Sights & Activities
        
          Hikeable and cyclable wadis (nechalim) within a 20-minute 4WD drive of here include Arava, Tzin (Zin), Amatzya (Amazyahu), Peres, Tamar, Tzafit and Ashalim. Other great places to pedal or hoof it include Mt Sodom and the Amiaz Plateau (Mishor Amiaz). The Small Makhtesh – the smallest of Israel’s three great erosion craters – is a 25-minute drive west. Your place of lodging can arrange to have someone take you out to the trailhead by 4WD (for a fee).
          The moshav has newly refurbished tennis and basketball courts, a children’s playground and a public swimming pool (adult/child 30/15NIS; open 11am to 2pm and 5pm to 8pm except Sunday mornings from May to Sukkot).
          Local artists produce pottery and metal sculptures. A number of farmers offer tours of their fields that include an introduction to desert agriculture.
        
        Desert CyclingCYCLING
            
              Mountain biking is a fantastic way to experience the wild wadis that drain into the Syrian-African Rift around Neot HaKikar. A wide variety of off-road circuits, including one called HeCharitz (‘the slit’) and 

another that follows Wadi Sodom to Wadi Pratzim, can be found within a 30-minute drive of Neot HaKikar. Mountain bikes can be rented from Cycle Inn (%052 899 1146; www.cycle-inn.co.il; per day 50NIS); Uzi and Barak are happy to supply you with maps and the low-down on area trails.

The Negev


Why Go?
        
          Visitors have been making their way across the arid landscape of the Negev desert for millennia, following in the footsteps of incense traders who transported precious cargo of frankincense and myrrh from south Arabia to the Mediterranean in ancient times. Today it's possible to visit the ruins of dramatically sited Nabataean cities that were built along this trade route, before heading south to the sybaritic summer playground of Eilat on the Red Sea coast.
          Archaeological sites aren't the only diversions on offer in this part of the country. So many vineyards and artisanal food producers have established themselves here in recent years that the region near the 
		  
		  
		  extraordinary geological phenomenon of the Makhtesh Ramon is now marketed as a wine route and is a popular weekend getaway for city slickers. As well, there are activities aplenty, including hiking, cycling, camel riding and 4WD desert drives. Put simply, this majestic southern desert region is one of the country's greatest attractions – don't miss it.

          A popular base for those visiting nearby Masada, Arad sits on a high plateau between Be’er Sheva and the Dead Sea. There are no sights worthy of mention in the town.
From the outside, this recently refurbished IYHA-affiliated hostel resembles an army barracks. But inside, the 53 clean and comfortable rooms are set within a lush and attractive garden. All have fridge, kettle and cable TV. To get here, walk east from the bus station up Yehuda St, turn right into HaPalmach St and then left at the skate park.

            The remains of two ancient settlements can be found at this archaeological site 13km northwest of the modern city of Arad. The lower city was inhabited in the Early Bronze Age (3150–2200 BCE) and the upper city was first settled in the Israelite period (1200 BCE). Highlights include the remains of an Israelite temple.

THE INCENSE ROUTE
        
          Often overlooked in school history lessons, the Nabataeans were ancient Arabs known to have lived in the Negev from the 4th century BCE. They were a nomadic people until Rome became aware of the profitability of their trade in spices and incense, and decided to muscle in on their territory and activities. After the Roman conquest, the Nabataeans took on more ‘European’ attributes, built permanent settlements and eventually adopted Christianity. They spoke a form of Aramaic, the lingua franca of the region some 2000 years ago, and were innovative engineers – despite the hostile desert environment, they developed sophisticated irrigation methods and their kings lavishly wasted water in front of guests to show off.
          At one point, the incense and spice trade route stretched from Yemen and Oman to the Mediterranean, passing through Saudi Arabia, Petra and Judea. As a result, the Negev cities of Avdat, Mamshit, Shivta and Haluza became prosperous, and the desert around them flourished.
          The atmospheric ruins of these settlements were declared Unesco World Heritage sites in 2005 under the collective designation of the Incense Route – Desert Cities in the Negev. Three of them are maintained and opened to the public by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority.
        
        
          AVDAT عبدات עבדת
          
            A beautifully preserved site, this ancient city 650m above sea level dominates the surrounding desert skyline. Named after the Nabataean monarch Obada, it was built in the 3rd century BCE as a caravan stop on the road from Petra to the Mediterra

nean. Prosperous throughout the Byzantine period, the city was deserted following an earthquake in 630 CE and the Muslim takeover of the Negev six years later.
            The ruins include a Roman bathhouse, catacombs, several 4th-century churches, a pottery workshop and a Byzantine winepress.
            Buy your tickets at the visitor centre next to the petrol station, where you can also watch a 10-minute film about the Incense Route. Then visit the nearby bathhouse before driving up the hill to a carpark next to the ruins. Those travelling by public transport will need to follow the steep walking track from the bathhouse.
            On Rte 40, Avdat lies 10km south of Sde Boker and 23km north of Mitzpe Ramon. Buses pass by in each direction about every hour from Sunday to Thursday.
          
        
        
          SHIVTA (SUBEITA) شبطا שיבטה
          
            The most isolated of the Nabataean towns, Shivta (h8am-5pm Apr-Sep, 8am-4pm Oct-Mar) was founded during the early Roman period (1st century BCE). Its ruins date from the Byzantine period (4th to 7th centuries CE), when it was an important stop on the caravan route between Egypt and Anatolia. They include churches, houses, tiled streets and an impressive irrigation system.
            Shivta is 58km southwest of Be’er Sheva. From Rte 40 continue from Telalim Junction on Rte 211 for about 15km. At the junction near the petrol station, drive 9km south.

ancient city also known as Memphis or Kurnub. It is the smallest but best-preserved Nabataean city in the Negev.
            Overlooking Wadi Mamshit, the settlement dates from the 1st century CE; it was later used by the Romans. The excavations include ancient reservoirs, watchtowers, churches and Roman and Byzantine cemeteries. One highlight is the large mosaic floor at the courtyard of the Church of St Nilus.
            Mamshit is on Rte 25, about 8km from Dimona. Any of the buses heading to Eilat via Dimona will drop you at the turn-off for the site.

          Developed in the 1960s and still rapidly expanding, the industry and university hub of Be'er Sheva (Beersheba) is the major city in the Negev. The only compelling reason for travellers to visit is to transfer between the train service that comes from the north and the bus services heading south.
        
      
      
        History
        
          Be’er Sheva was mentioned in the Bible (Judges 20:1; I Samuel 3:20; II Samuel 3:10, 17:11, 24:2), though few traces of that time are detectable today.
          During WWI the small town fell to Allenby’s Allied forces after a charge by units of the Australian Light Horse. The Egyptian army conquered Be’er Sheva after the State of Israel was declared, but in 

October 1948 the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) regained the town and a new era of immigration began.

            One of a group of three tels (prehistoric hilltop ruins) included on the Unesco World Heritage List in 2005, these ruins include two-thirds of a fortified city dating from the early Israelite period (10th century BCE) and are an important example of biblical-period urban planning. The site is 5km northeast of Be’er Sheva on the Shocket Junction road, near the Bedouin settlement of Tel Sheva.

Like the other Unesco-listed tels (Megiddo and Hazor), the ruins show traces of underground water-collecting systems that were created to serve dense urban communities; the best-preserved elements are the cisterns and a 70m well, the deepest in Israel. There are great views to be had from an observation tower.

HIKING IN THE NEGEV
        
          There are some excellent hikes in the Negev region, taking in a surprisingly wide variety of landscapes. Particularly recommended are those around Sde Boker, Mitzpe Ramon and Eilat.
          The Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI) has field schools with lodging at Mitzpe Ramon, Eilat and Hatzeva, 50km south of the Dead Sea on Rte 90; reserve ahead for a bed. Although they predominantly serve school groups, they will usually be able to sell detailed hiking maps and give up-to-date information about local hiking trails, but unfortunately they don't always have multilingual staff. A better bet is to chat with staff at hostels – Green Backpackers in Mitzpe Ramon and the Hamburg House Field School in Sde Boker are particularly helpful. The Israel Nature and Parks Authority staff at the Ramon Visitor Centre in Mitzpe Ramon provide advice and sell plenty of maps.
          A new outfit called Self Guided Negev Trek (%054-533 0948; www.sgnegevtrek.com) can organise food, lodging, maps, transportation and camping gear for those wanting to hike a 61km Negev section of the Israel Trail. The five-day trek starts in Mitzpe Ramon and crosses desert expanses, hidden canyons, cool springs and breathtaking scenery.
          The Negev is a harsh environment but due to its rapid development visitors can easily be lulled into a false sense of security and forget to follow safety guidelines. It is best to make an early start, cover your head and use sunscreen, drink plenty of water, follow marked trails and avoid physical exertion in the middle of the day (noon to 3pm) and during the summer months. Don't hike by yourself and be sure to inform someone of where you are going so that 

they can sound the alarm if you don't return from your hike as scheduled.

          Initially famous as the home of Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, Kibbutz Sde Boker (aka Sede Boquer), established in 1952, remains one of the best known of all Negev kibbutzim. Now home to around 400 residents, it welcomes visitors to Ben-Gurion's Desert Home, a small house museum on the kibbutz that is an important pilgrimage destination for many residents and supporters of Israel.
          The kibbutz was established by young pioneers who planned to breed cattle in the desert; its name is Hebrew for ‘Cowboy’s Field’. Ben-Gurion joined this lush oasis the following year at the age of 67, to practice what he preached by cultivating the Negev. Only 14 months later he returned to the political scene as minister of defence and went on to serve a second term as prime minister, returning to kibbutz life in 1963.
          About 5km southwest (by road) of the kibbutz is the university settlement of Midreshet Ben-Gurion (Midreshet Sde Boker; www.boker.org.il), a satellite campus of Be’er Sheva’s Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. The campus is well known for its environmental research and incorporates institutions including the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research 

and the Ben-Gurion National Solar Energy Centre. There is a small commercial centre with cafes, a pub and a supermarket, as well as a number of accommodation options that are particularly handy for those wanting to explore En Avdat National Park.

              In his will, Israel's founding father asked that the modest kibbutz quarters where he lived with his wife Paula remained exactly as he left them, and that’s what you see when you visit this house museum. A short animated film about the great man's life is shown near the entrance, recounting his birth in Poland, immigration to Palestine and dedication to the establishment of the state of Israel ('My greatest desire – the air I breathe – is Zionism').

The graves of David (1886–1973) and Paula (1892–1968) Ben-Gurion lie in a spectacular clifftop setting overlooking the stunning Wadi Zin and the Avdat plain. A desert flora park has been planted next to the tombs, and wild ibexes often wander here.
              The site is on the southern edge of Midreshet Ben-Gurion, near the northern entrance of En Avdat National Park.

              En Avdat is a freak of nature in this otherwise bone-dry desert – a freshwater spring that miraculously flows via a waterfall into a narrow and winding ravine with steep sides of soft white chalk. Reached via an easy hike past caves that were inhabited by monks during the Byzantine period, it is home to Euphrates poplars and to fauna including ibex. Unfortunately, swimming in the ravine and its pools is prohibited.
            
            
              There are two entrances to the park – southern and northern. The main ticket office is at the northern entrance, at Midreshet Ben-Gurion (next to the Ben-Gurion Graves and the Wilderness of Zin nature trail).
              The most popular trail to the spring covers 7km and takes around four hours. Note that eating in the park is not allowed, and the only toilet facilities are at the main ticket office. Start from the inner parking lot and follow the blue markers into the ravine and 

on to the first waterfall. Climb the stairs on the right wall of the ravine and follow the markers to the grove of poplars at the upper end. The trail follows a series of stairs until it reaches two ladders attached to the ravine wall. Once you make it to the top, follow the cliff to the left (south) until you reach a spectacular observation point. Continue south along the dry creek, looking out for rock art on the western bank. In the winter, the waterholes at this point are full and quite beautiful. From here, you can make your way to the petrol station on Hwy 40 near the ruins of Avdat, from where you'll need to hitch or take a bus back to your starting point or to Mitzpe Ramon.
              Another popular trail leads to En Akev, a freshwater spring on the other side of Wadi Zin. Starting from the car park next to the petrol station and the ticket office for the ruins, follow the blue markers as they circle the park fence on the north side, cross two shallow valleys and then take a short descent to the En Akev Elyon (Upper Akev Spring) trail crossing, where there are natural pools. From here, follow the black markers and walk north down the canyon for 3km until you reach a waterfall and large pool at En Akev. Then follow the green markers on the west side of the canyon to go along the Divshon Pass (Maale Divshon), a 6km trail along the plateau and down a steep windy trail (be careful!) to the paved entrance road to the national park. Take the road north (uphill) to Midreshet Ben-Gurion, where you will be able to take a bus back to your starting point or to Mitzpe Ramon. In all, this trail covers 13km and will take around seven hours.
A combined ticket to Avdat National Park and the En Avdat National Park costs adult/child/student 46/24/39NIS. All of these trails are best explored during winter, when the waterfalls flow.

RAMAT HANEGEV WINE ROUTE
        
          In recent years the number of vineyards in the valleys and hills between Mitzpe Ramon and Be'er Sheva has grown significantly. These vineyards mark the first attempts to nurture grapes in the desert since the ancient Nabataeans made wine at Shivta and Avdat. Using innovative computerised watering methods (eg drip irrigation), today's winegrowers have converted arid areas of dust into fertile land.
          Located on the kibbutz of the same name, the Sde Boker Winery was established in 1999 in association with the School of Agriculture Rehovot to test the possibility of growing wine grapes with brackish water. Winemaker Zvi Remak hails from San Francisco and concentrates on making handcrafted, barrel, red wines from cabernet sauvignon and merlot 
grapes. You can taste his wines at a stand in the visitor centre next to the Ben-Gurion Desert Home.
          Located close to the Avdat ruins, the Carmey Avdat Winery (%08-653 5177; www.carmeyavdat.com; W) is a family-run vineyard built on the ruins of an ancient agricultural settlement. It harvested its first yield in 2002, and now produces a rosé, merlot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet sauvignon/merlot blend. This is a lovely spot to spend a few nights; it offers rustic cabins with kitchen and private dipping pool (per double on weekdays 560NIS to 890NIS, on the weekend 670NIS to 890NIS). Breakfast is delivered to guests, and there's a produce shop where local cheeses and other products can be purchased.
          As well as producing organic wine, olives and fruit, the Boker Valley Vineyards Farm (%052-578 6863, 052-862 2930; www.bokerfarm.com; d weekday/weekend US$160/190, f weekday/weekend $US270/300; a) offers comfortable accommodation. Operated by a friendly Israeli–Dutch family, it has five safari-style cabins sleeping between two and five; each comes with a small kitchenette and outdoor barbecue area. Guests love the spa-bath hut and the lavish home-cooked breakfasts. The farm is a 3.5km drive north of Kibbutz Sde Boker on Rte 40, between the Telalim and Halukim Junctions.
          Other local wines to sample include those produced by Nana (try its impressive chardonnay), Kadesh Barnea, Ashba, Rota, Sdema, Rujum and Derech Erez. For more information about the Ramat Hanegev region and the wine route, go to www.rng.org.il.

          You'll feel like an extra in a sci-fi movie when exploring the massive Makhtesh Ramon Nature Reserve. The landscape resembles Tatooine (the fictional desert planet in Star Wars) and the wide, open spaces, far from city lights and crowds, are equally suited to those seeking solitude or an activity-triggered adrenaline rush.
          In Hebrew the word 'mitzpe' means ‘lookout’, and the town of Mitzpe Ramon, spectacularly sited on the makhtesh's northern edge, well and truly lives up to its name. Views are of the take-your-breath-away variety and draw a constant stream of tourists – as a result the town is well set up with tourism infrastructure.
          Sometimes described as Israel’s very own Grand Canyon, the reserve is the largest protected area in Israel and is home to a huge number of hiking, cycling and horse-riding trails, as well as cliffs offering rappelling opportunities. If you're keen on outdoor activities, you'll be in your element.
          Despite being in the heart of the desert, Mitzpe (as it's often called) is also one of the coldest places in Israel due to its elevation (900m above sea level), so pack appropriately.

              Perched on the makhtesh rim, this visitor centre operated by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority has an extremely helpful information desk providing information about the Makhtesh Ramon Nature Reserve. It also contains a museum with four exhibition spaces, the most interesting of which are the hall with a 3D exhibition about the creation of the makhtesh and the audiovisual hall where a movie about desert animals is screened. Bookings are essential if you wish to visit the museum.
            
            
              The Israel Nature and Parks Authority also offers private guided tours of the nature reserve. Telephone or email the visitor centre for details.

              This tiny desert wildlife park located next to the visitor centre shows how nature can find a way to survive even in the harshest desert conditions. It offers an integrated approach to the geology, flora and fauna that represent the six habitats of the Negev’s desert dwellers (insects, mammals and reptiles) and numbers scorpions, tortoises and snakes among its residents.

Located on the northern edge of town, this cluster of hangars and warehouses was once used by the military but now houses artisanal factories, artists' studios, boutique hotels, cafes and a dance workshop. With a pronounced hippy (as opposed to hipster) vibe, its arts and crafts aren't going to be to everyone's tastes, but the presence of Faran Cosmetics, Lasha Bakery and the Hadasaar and Hakatze cafes mean that it's worth a stop.
            
          
      
      
        WHAT EXACTLY IS A MAKHTESH?
        
          Usually translated as ‘crater’ and occasionally as ‘canyon’, a more accurate definition of a makhtesh is an ‘erosion cirque’ – a large, asymmetrical hole formed by erosion as the Negev made the transition from ocean to desert. Providing a peep into the Earth’s crust, the makhteshim found in the Negev and Sinai are thought to be unique geological phenomena because each is drained by a wadi (valley), although similar rock features have been found in Turkmenistan and Iran. Makhtesh Ramon is the largest makhtesh in Israel.
          There are two other makhteshim in the Negev: Makhtesh HaKatan (Small Makhtesh) and Makhtesh HaGadol (Big Makhtesh). Makhtesh HaKatan, almost perfectly circular, can be found off the highway linking Dimona with the Dead Sea (Rte
25). The entrance to Makhtesh HaGadol is near the sleepy town of Yeroham (take Rte 204 south from Dimona towards Sde Boker). There is a beautiful drive right through the crater on Rte 225; look out for the coloured sands.
HIKES AROUND MITZPE RAMON
        
          Some of the best hiking in the country is available in and around Mitzpe. Choose from an easy, 5.5km, two-to-three-hour 'Green Trail' descent into the makhtesh; a medium-to-difficult hike to an ancient ammonite wall; and a highly recommended 16km, five-hour hike from Mitzpe to the Hemet Cistern. The latter follows a trail along the cliff edge, down into a lush canyon and on to a 4000-year-old cistern.
          Other walks in the area include a 3.5km loop to Wadi Ardon, a 7km loop to Wadi Ardon and the Nekarot Horseshoe and a hardcore five-to-six-hour climb up and down Mt Ardon.
          Shvil Net publishes a handy 1:40,000 map covering the Makhtesh Ramon Area for cyclists and hik
ers, which can be bought from the Ramon Visitor Centre.

          Part of the Great Rift Valley that runs for some 5000km from northern Syria to central Mozambique, this austerely beautiful and sparsely populated desert stretches from the Dead Sea to the Red Sea and has as its backdrop the majestic multi-hued Jordanian mountain range known in Israel as the Edom (Red) Mountains. The desert scenery is most spectacular around the settlement of Tzukim (aka Zuqim, or Zukim) on Hwy 90 between the Dead Sea and Zihor Junction.
          The Arava is becoming known as a centre for outdoor activities, especially cycling. A popular 33km bike trail runs along a wadi (dry river bed) between Zofar and Paran, and the desert terrain is a favourite destination for 4WD enthusiasts. In rainy years, Eshet Lake near Paran is a popular swimming spot.

              A true oasis in the desert, this kibbutz has lush green surrounds and a bizarre pink tower in which residents have established an arts centre and a gallery 
where artisan crafts are sold to the public. The community was established in 1989 and focuses on promoting cooperation, creativity and learning in daily life. It supports itself through agriculture (orchard and olive grove), a winery, a solar field and the workshops it runs on self-awareness and eco-building.
            
            
              The kibbutz is located on Hwy 40, halfway between Mitzpe Ramon and Eilat (10km up Hwy 40 from Ketura Junction on Hwy 90).

              The colourful sands and craggy mountains of the Timna Valley, 25km north of Eilat, are full of minerals including copper, iron and manganese. This park incorporates traces from one of the world's first copper mines, and is home to thousands of ancient mining shafts, the remains of smelting furnaces dating back to ancient imperial Egypt, temple remnants and ancient rock drawings depicting ostriches, ibex and Egyptian battle chariots.
            
            
              Other attractions are geological phenomena including Solomon’s Pillars (two huge columns of granite formed by rainwater some 540 million years ago) and the Mushroom, an eroded monolith in the shape of…you guessed it.

              Wild animals that are mentioned in the Bible are bred at this nature reserve 35km north of Eilat, as are other endangered desert species. Divided into three areas – an area where herds of desert herbivores live in conditions similar to the wild; enclosures containing large predators, reptiles and small desert animals; and a ‘dark room’ to view nocturnal animals when they are active – it can be thoroughly explored in two hours if you have your own car.
            
            
              The reserve's inhabitants include asses, oryx, addax and ostriches, and its flora includes acacia groves. You'll find it on Hwy 90 about 42km north of Eilat, between Kibbutz Yotvata and Kibbutz Samar.

ISRAEL'S KIBBUTZIM
        
          Back in 1909, when the first kibbutz was established in Palestine, the idea was both practical – growing crops in a harsh climate required collective action – and utopian. The word 'kibbutz' means gathering or clustering, and the original kibbutzniks (members of a kibbutz) were driven by equally weighted beliefs in socialism and Zionism. Committed to establishing a Jewish homeland, they believed that farming collectively owned land in their new place of residence would provide a sound economic and political underpinning for an eventual Jewish state.
          At the outbreak of WWII there were 79 kibbutzim in Palestine, all of which relied on agriculture for their livelihoods. The movement reached its apogee in the 1950s and 1960s, when many new kibbutzim were established by Nahal, an Israel Defence Forces 

program that combined military service and establishment of new agricultural settlements. In the 1980s, as a more individualist ethos gained currency, increasing numbers of residents started to leave their kibbutz homes and forge new lives and careers in Israel's rapidly expanding cities. A number of kibbutzim ended up in debt and, eventually, were forced to privatise. The others had no choice but to reinvent themselves by adopting new ways of structuring the kibbutz economy and finding new sources of income. Many diversified into non-agricultural endeavours including manufacturing, artisanal industries, tourism and innovative environmentally sustainable businesses.
          Today, there are approximately 270 kibbutzim in Israel. Of these, 75% function according to an economic model known as 'renewing' (mitchadesh), under which kibbutzniks generate and keep their own income. The remaining 25% are run according to the traditional collective model (kibbutz shitufi), whereby members are compensated equally, regardless of what work each member does. Eight of these collective kibbitzim are located in the Negev and most of them have adopted a business plan that includes sustainable agriculture and tourism.
          For some interesting musings on the history of the kibbutz movement, consider reading Walking Israel, a travelogue written by Israel-based former NBC correspondent Martin Fletcher.
        
      
    
    
      Eilat

          It's incumbent upon travel writers to tell it as it is, so we won't pull our punches when describing this 
resort town on Israel's southern tip. Hugely popular with Israeli families looking for an affordable beach break and with Eastern European tourists seeking a refuge from the bone-chilling winters back home, Eilat is brash, ugly and almost inevitably crowded, a place where being scantily clad and sunburned is the rule rather than the exception, and where cocktails are about as close to culture as the local scene gets.
          However – and it's a big however – Eilat is also a place where visitors seem to have a great time and where children in particular tend to be blissfully happy. The turquoise-tinted waters of the Red Sea offer snorkelling, diving and swimming opportunities galore, and there are plenty of other attractions on offer, including an aquarium, a theme park, tax-free shopping and an array of outdoor activities showcasing the spectacular local desert scenery.
          Average winter temperatures are between 21°C and 25°C, but come summer the temperature averages 40°C. Fortunately, humidity levels are low (15%).
        
      
      
        History
        
          Four thousand years ago the desert landscape surrounding Eilat was rich in copper, and trade between Eilat and the Theban sea port of Elim flourished. As well, frankincense and myrrh from Ethiopia and Punt passed through the port of Eilat, as did bitumen and natron from the Dead Sea. In the Roman era, a road 
was built from Eilat to Petra, opening a new trade route with the Nabataeans.
          Trade declined after the Roman era, but Eilat stayed in touch with the wider world courtesy of its location on the Darb el-Hajj (Muslim Pilgrim's Road) between Africa and Mecca. The settlement remained small and life relatively uneventful until the modern city and port were built after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.

          Water Sports
          
            The Red Sea offers some great diving opportunities and Eilat has no shortage of dive clubs. However, due to the sheer volume of divers, the reef has seen some inevitable damage over the years. Over the past decade, steps have been taken to rehabilitate the coral and thousands of young coral colonies have been grown in aquariums and attached to the existing reef.
            It is true that all you need to do is pop your head underwater in Eilat to see all sorts of colourful fish and coral (there are thought to be 1200 species of fish and 250 of coral). This accessibility makes it a 
great place for kids as well as for beginners looking to do a PADI course. The best dive sites are at Coral Beach Nature Reserve, Lighthouse Reef, Neptune's Tables (aka Veronica's Reef) and the Caves.
            Prices vary, but average around 250NIS for a guided snorkel or introductory dive and 450NIS for a dive lesson (all including equipment hire). To hire equipment and dive or snorkel independently you will be looking at around 60NIS for snorkel, mask and fins, and 170NIS for a wetsuit, tank and breathing equipment.
            Most dive centres open daily from 8.30am to 5pm.

            Although overshadowed by the activities on the beach and underwater, there are some marvellous hiking possibilities in the mountains and valleys just outside Eilat.
            When you go hiking in the desert be sure to abide by these safety guidelines: follow a marked path, take sufficient water, cover your head, don't hike in high summer and avoid the Israel–Egypt border area.

          Mt Tzfachot Circular TrailHIKING
This almost circular 4km hike culminates in superb views of the four countries whose borders meet around the Gulf of Eilat/Aqaba: Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Within reach of non-drivers and suitable for all ages and most fitness levels, the hike takes 2½ hours and is best enjoyed at sunrise or towards the end of the day.
              
              
                Take bus 15 from the central bus station and get off at the Camel Ranch stop opposite the Isrotel Yam Suf Hotel at Coral Beach. Follow the sign pointing to Wadi Shlomo, walk along the dirt road for about 2km past Camel Ranch and head left along Wadi Tzfachot (aka Zefahot, or Zfachot), following the green trail markers. You'll pass a dry waterfall on your right. After 300m the path forks with a black-marked trail veering to the right. Keep going straight ahead on the green marked trail for another 200m. It then turns to the left and starts to climb quite steeply. Head up this path and keep climbing for about 15 minutes to reach the Mt Tzfachot summit at about 278m.
                From this vantage point, Sinai and the Crusader castle on Coral Island are visible to the south, while across the gulf are the Jordanian port city of Aqaba and the Saudi Arabian border. To the northeast is the greenery of Kibbutz Eilot. Although sunset can be beautiful here, hikers are advised not to return after dark as the trail can be difficult to follow. The path ends at the SPNI Field School on the main road.

              This highly regarded outfit offers jeep tours around Eilat, through the Negev Desert and to the Makhtesh Ramon, as well as extremely popular tours to Jordan including a one-day tour to Petra and a two-day tour to Petra and Wadi Rum.



Around Eilat
      
        Eilat is surrounded by jagged, red-rock mountains created by the tectonic movements of the Great Rift Valley (Syrian-African Rift). The desert environment, blazing with glorious colours (especially at sunrise and sunset), is home to a huge variety of wildlife, flora and fauna.
        Hikers will want to head for the Eilat Mountains. Popular treks include the six-hour climb up Mt Shlomo, which rewards hikers with views to Jordan, across the Arava Valley and (on a clear day) across the Gulf of Eilat. The start and end points of this walk are different, so you'll need two cars. A handout with map and directions is available from the SPNI Field School.
        An excellent six- to seven-hour hike will take you through the spectacular Nakhal Gishron (part of the Israel National Trail) from Har Yoash to the Egyptian border. Details are available at the field school.
      
      
        SECURITY ALERT
        
          Always check the security situation with the tourist office in Eilat before driving along route 12, which hugs the border with Egypt and has been the site of terrorist incidents in the past. Hikers should do the same with the SPNI Field School near Coral Beach before setting out anywhere in the border region.

Why Go?
        
          The ancient Nabataean city of Petra, with its elaborate architecture chiselled out of the pink-hued cliffs, is not just the leading highlight of Jordan, a country blessed with more than its fair share of top sites: it's a wonder of the world. It lay forgotten for centuries, known only to the Bedouin who made it their home, until the great Swiss explorer Jean Louis Burckhardt happened upon it in 1812.  
          Built partly in honour of the dead, the Petra necropolis retains much of its sense of hidden mystery thanks to its inaccessible location in the heart of a windblown landscape.  Reached via the Siq, a narrow rift in the land whose cliffs cast long shadows across the once-sacred way, the path suddenly slithers into sunlight in front of the Treasury – a spectacle that cannot fail to impress. Add to this the cheerfulness of the Bedouin people, and it's easy to see what makes Petra a must-visit.

Petra Highlights
      
      
        
          1 Tread the path of history by winding through the Siq, the sheer-sided chasm leading to an ancient world.
2 Catch the early morning sun slanting off the pillars of the Treasury, a sublime spectacle.
          3 Climb the processional way to the High Place of Sacrifice, pause for tea with the Bedouin and return to the valley floor through a garden of wildflowers.
          4 Search the Royal Tombs for spirits lurking in the rainbow-coloured hollows.
          5 Make the pilgrimage to the Monastery and watch the weather-burnished stones catch alight at sunset.
          6 Let your soul glide through the Siq’s shadows, guided by music and candlelight on tour with Petra by Night.
          7 Prepare your own traditional Jordanian supper at Petra Kitchen.
          8 Visit Little Petra and enjoy Nabataean tombs and temples in a miniature siq without the company of tour groups.
        
      
    
    
      History
      
        Petra was established in the 4th century BCE by the Nabataeans, a nomadic tribe from Arabia. In its heyday, the city was home to around 30,000 people, including scribes and engineers who built a city of sophisticated culture with an emphasis on the afterlife. Around 100 CE, the Romans assumed control, leaving trademark features such as the colonnaded street.
Earthquakes in 363 and 551 ruined much of Petra and it became a forgotten outpost, known only to local Bedouin who preferred to keep its whereabouts secret. In 1812, a young Swiss explorer, JL Burckhardt, ended Petra’s splendid isolation, riding into the city disguised as a Muslim holy man.
        During the 1950s, Petra achieved near-mythological status in Israel, and a number of young Israelis risked – and in some cases lost – their lives trying to visit the site surreptitiously.
        A Unesco World Heritage Site since 1985, Petra was elected one of the ‘New Seven Wonders of the World’ by an international public poll in 2008, proving that its allure has survived two centuries worth of outside scrutiny.
      
    
    
      FINDING YOUR OWN PACE IN PETRA
      
        Instead of trying to ‘see it all’ (the quickest way to achieve monument fatigue), make Petra your own by sparing time to amble among unnamed tombs or sip tea at a Bedouin stall.
        
          AHalf day (five hours) Stroll through the Siq, savouring the moment of revelation at the Treasury. Climb the steps to the High Place of Sacrifice and take the path through Wadi Farasa, passing a paintbox of rock formations.
          AOne day (eight hours) Complete the half-day itinerary, but pack a picnic. Visit the Royal Tombs, walk along to Qasr al-Bint and hike the wadi that leads to Jebel Haroun as far as Snake Monument – an ideal perch for a snack and a snooze. Save some energy for the climb to the Monastery, a fitting finale for any Petra visit.
ATwo days Spend a second day scrambling through exciting Wadi Muthlim and restore energies over a barbecue at the Basin Restaurant. Sit near the Theatre to watch the Royal Tombs at sunset – the best spectacle in Petra. Reward your efforts with a Turkish bath and a drink in the Cave Bar – the oldest pub in the world.
        
      
    
    
      8Getting There & Away
      
        It’s almost impossible to cover Petra as a day trip from Israel or the West Bank by public transport.
        The Yitzhak Rabin–Wadi Araba border crossing (%08-630 0555; h6.30am-10pm Sun-Thu, 8am-8pm Fri & Sat) provides the easiest access to Jordan. From Eilat it’s a short taxi ride (50NIS) to the border. On the Jordanian side, a taxi to Petra costs around JD60 (JD80 return). Alternatively, take a taxi into Aqaba (JD10) and a minibus to Petra (JD5, 2½ hours, 120km); these leave when full between 6am and 7am, and there is also an occasional service between 11am and noon.
        The Allenby–King Hussein Bridge border crossing (%02-548 2600; h8am-8pm Sun-Thu, 8am-2pm Fri & Sat) is handy from Jerusalem (45 minutes), but you must have a pre-arranged visa and it’s frustratingly long-winded returning to the Palestinian Territories and Israel through this border. From Jerusalem, you can get a sherut to the border. From Amman to Petra, there is a daily JETT (%962-6-566 4146; www.jett.com.jo; single/return JD9.50/19; h6.30am, returning at 4pm) bus and regular minibuses (JD7, four hours, 210km); these leave when full from Amman’s 
south bus station between 6am and 4pm. A taxi from Amman costs around JD90 (or JD130 along the spectacular King’s Hwy).

The Ancient City
      
        1Sights
        
          There are more than 800 registered sites in Petra, including some 500 tombs. From the entrance, a path winds 800m downhill through an area called Bab as-Siq (Gateway to the Siq), punctuated with the first signs of ancient Petra.
          Beware that Petra is crowned with ‘high places’ of ancient religious significance. These locations, affording magnificent views, usually involve steep steps to a hilltop where there is no railing or other safety features.

      )
            
              The 1.2km siq, or canyon, with its narrow, vertical walls, is undeniably one of the highlights of Petra. The walk through this magical corridor, as it snakes its way towards the hidden city, is one full of anticipation for the wonders ahead - a point not wasted on 
the Nabataeans who made the passage into a sacred way, punctuated with sites of spiritual significance.

              Known locally as the Treasury, this tomb is where most visitors fall in love with Petra. The Hellenistic facade is an astonishing piece of craftsmanship. Although carved out of iron-laden sandstone to serve as a tomb for the Nabataean King Aretas III, the Treasury derives its name from the story that an Egyptian pharaoh hid his treasure here (in the facade urn) while pursuing the Israelites.

              From the Treasury, the passage broadens into what is commonly referred to as the Outer Siq. Riddling the walls of the Outer Siq are over 40 tombs and houses built by the Nabataeans in a ‘crow step’ style reminiscent of Assyrian architecture. Colloquially known as the Street of Facades, they are easily accessible, unlike many tombs in Petra.

              The most accessible of Petra’s ‘High Places’, this well-preserved site was built atop Jebel Madbah with drains to channel the blood of sacrificial animals. A flight of steps signposted just before the Theatre leads to the site: turn right at the obelisks to reach the sacrificial platform. You can ascend by donkey 
(about JD10 one way), but you’ll sacrifice both the sense of achievement on reaching the summit and the good humour of your poor old transport.

              Originally built by the Nabataeans (not the Romans) over 2000 years ago, the Theatre was chiselled out of rock, slicing through many caves and tombs in the process. It was enlarged by the Romans to hold about 8500 (around 30% of the population of Petra) soon after they arrived in 106 CE. Badly damaged by an earthquake in 363 CE, the Theatre was partially dismantled to build other structures but it remains a Petra highlight.

              Downhill from the Theatre, the wadi widens to create a larger thoroughfare. To the right, the great massif of Jebel al-Khubtha looms over the valley. Within its west-facing cliffs are burrowed some of the most impressive burial places in Petra, known collectively as the ‘Royal Tombs’. They look particularly stunning bathed in the golden light of sunset.

              Downhill from the Theatre, the Colonnaded Street marks Petra’s city centre. The street was built in about 106 CE and follows the standard Roman pat
tern of an east–west decumanus, but without the normal cardo maximus (north–south axis). Columns of marble-clad sandstone originally lined the 6m-wide carriageway, and covered porticoes gave access to shops.

              One of the few free-standing structures in Petra, Qasr al-Bint was built in around 30 BCE by the Nabataeans. It was later adapted to the cult of Roman emperors and destroyed around the 3rd century CE. Despite the name given to it by the local Bedouin – Castle of the Pharaoh’s Daughter – the temple was originally built as a dedication to Nabataean gods and was one of the most important temples in Petra.

      )
            
              Hidden high in the hills, the Monastery is one of the legendary monuments of Petra. Similar in design to the Treasury but far bigger (50m wide and 45m high), it was built in the 3rd century BCE as a Nabataean tomb. It derives its name from the crosses carved on the inside walls, suggestive of its use as a church in Byzantine times. The ancient rock-cut path of more than 800 steps starts from the Nabataean Museum and follows the old processional route.

Siq al-Barid (Little Petra)السيق البارد (البتراء الصغيرة)

        oLittle Petra SiqRUIN(hdaylight hours)F
            
              From the car park, an obvious path leads to the 400m-long siq, which opens out into larger areas. 
The first open area has a temple, which archaeologists know little about. Four triclinia – one on the left and three on the right – are in the second open area, and were probably used as dining rooms to feed hungry merchants and travellers. About 50m further along the siq is the Painted House, another small dining room, which is reached by some exterior steps. 
            
          
        Al-BeidhaRUIN(hdaylight hours)F
            
              The Neolithic ruins of Al-Beidha date back 9000 years and, along with Jericho, constitute one of the oldest archaeological sites in the Middle East. The remains of around 65 round (and later rectangular) structures are especially significant because they pinpoint the physical transition from hunter-gatherer to settled herder-agriculturalist communities. The settlement was abandoned around 6000 BCE, keeping the site intact. 
              A 15-minute walking trail, starting to the left of the entrance to Little Petra, leads to the site.
