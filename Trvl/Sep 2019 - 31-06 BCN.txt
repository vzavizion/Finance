		you will almost definitely find scalpers lurking near the ticket windows. They are often club members and can sometimes get you in at a significant reduction. Don’t pay until you are safely seated

		clear impression of medieval convent life, from the chapter house and austere refectory to a fully equipped kitchen and infirmary
	
	founded in 1326 for the nuns of the Order of St Clare
		it took craftsmen a little over a year to prepare Pedralbes (from the Latin petras albas, “white stones”) for its first community of nuns. The speed of that initial construction and the subsequent uninterrupted habitation by the order helps explain the perfect architectural harmony
	
		after six hundred years of isolation, the monastery was sequestered by the Generalitat during the Civil War and it later opened to the public in 1983

	architectural highlight is the large, elegant, three-storey cloister
		
	cloisters
		real highlight here is a small chapel to the right of the entrance, the Capella de Sant Miquel, which is adorned with remarkably vivid frescoes.
		
		small room beside the chapel itself holds the carved marble tomb of the monastery’s original sponsor, Elisenda de Montcada, wife of Jaume II. Widowed in 1327, six months after she and her husband laid the first stone, Elisenda retired to an adjacent palace, where she lived until her death in 1364. One side in the cloister shows her dressed as a penitent widow, while the other part, an alabaster masterpiece inside the adjacent church, shows her dressed as queen
		
	eating in the refectory must not have been a whole lot of fun, judging by the inscriptions around the walls exhorting Silentium (Silence) and Audi Tacens (Listen and Keep Quiet)
		
	upstairs is a grand hall that was once the dormidor (sleeping quarters). It was lined by tiny night cells, but they were long ago removed

		clever audiovisual display aboard the vessel brings to life the ghastly existence of the slaves, prisoners and volunteers (!) who, at full steam, could haul this vessel along at 9 knots. They remained chained to their seats, four to an oar, at all times. Here they worked, drank (fresh water was stored below decks, where the infirmary was also located), ate, slept and went to the loo.

	Antoni Gaudí’s extraordinary Park Güell, his most ambitious project
	
	commissioned by Eusebi Güell, it was originally planned as a private housing estate of sixty dwellings, furnished with ornamental paths, recreational areas and decorative monuments. The idea was to build a “Garden City” of the type then popular in England. Gaudí worked on the project from 1900 until 1914, but in the end only two houses were actually built, and the park was opened to the public instead in 1922
