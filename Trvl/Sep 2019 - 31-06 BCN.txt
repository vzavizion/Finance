		clever audiovisual display aboard the vessel brings to life the ghastly existence of the slaves, prisoners and volunteers (!) who, at full steam, could haul this vessel along at 9 knots. They remained chained to their seats, four to an oar, at all times. Here they worked, drank (fresh water was stored below decks, where the infirmary was also located), ate, slept and went to the loo. You could smell a galley like this from miles away

	Antoni Gaudí’s extraordinary Park Güell, his most ambitious project
	
	commissioned by Eusebi Güell, it was originally planned as a private housing estate of sixty dwellings, furnished with ornamental paths, recreational areas and decorative monuments. The idea was to build a “Garden City” of the type then popular in England. Gaudí worked on the project from 1900 until 1914, but in the end only two houses were actually built, and the park was opened to the public instead in 1922

			porter’s lodge
			monumental stairway climbs past a giant mosaic salamander known as el drac (the dragon) to reach the vast Hall of Columns, where 84 Doric columns soar at disconcertingly irregular angles to enclose a space that Gaudí intended to be the estate’s market
			
			the best-known element of the park is the long, meandering ceramic bench that snakes along the edge of the terrace that forms the roof of the Hall of Columns
			
	Casa Museu Gaudí
