oasis resort of Huacachina
	both relaxation and white-knuckle thrills
	at this peaceful desert oasis, its lagoon ringed by palm trees, you can relax and enjoy the scenery, or hit the dunes on a sandboard or dune buggy
	lagoon is supplemented by water pumped up from artesian wells, making it green, salty swimmable lagoon
	mud from the lake is reputed to cure arthritis and rheumatism if you plaster yourself all over with it
	sand around the lagoon is also supposed to benefit people with respiratory problems, so it’s not uncommon to see locals buried up to the neck in the dunes
	climb the dunes at the end of the lake and take in the views from the top early in the morning, before it gets too hot and prior to the noisy dune-buggy runs	
	
!?
Ica
	!
	wine and pisco production

		you’ll get a better view on an early morning trip, since the air gets hazier as the day progresses
		take a helicopter tour to get the full impact of these intricate symbols
	if you’re keen to keep your feet on the ground, make for the mirador (viewpoint), 2km north of Palpa

	Monasterio de Santa Catalina
	attractive suburbs of San Lázaro, Yanahuara and Cayma, the latter being particularly renowned for its dramatic views of the valley
	regions around the city offer access to two of the world’s deepest canyons – Colca and Cotahuasi	
	
!!!	
Colca Canyon
	deepest canyon in the world at more than 1km from cliff-edge to river bottom - twice the size of the Grand Canyon
		nearly twice the depth of Arizona’s Grand Canyon

	!!!
	quaint town of Chivay 	
		fantastic trekking and canoeing destination best in the dry season, May–Sept)
			descending to the canyon floor
				tough and quite dangerous in sections			
			!!!
			Mirador Achachina Walk 
				fifteen-minute stroll from the plaza in Cabanaconde takes you past the bullring to the Mirador Achachina, a good spot for spotting condors and viewing the western end of the valley from above
			Basic Colca Trek 
				The start of the classic route from Cabanaconde to the bottom of the Colca Canyon can be reached just ten minutes’ walk along a fairly clear track beyond the newly constructed Casa de Pablo hostel, itself a five-minute walk from the plaza. The descent from here follows an incredibly steep path, quite dangerous in parts, down to the Oasis, a rustic lodge and campsite right in the bottom of the canyon; it takes one and a half to two hours to descend and four or five to get back up. Many people stay the night.
			Cabanaconde to Lake Mucurca 
				There is a popular eight-hour hike from Cabanaconde that culminates at Lake Mucurca (4000m). At its end point the astonishingly beautiful Ampato volcano is reflected in the lake’s crystalline waters
		multi-day trekking	
			The Tapay Trail 
				This well-used trekking route connects Cabanaconde with the small settlement of Tapay via the Oasis. It is a two- to four-day return hike through fine scenery, immense canyons, tiny hamlets like Cosñirhua (2350m) and Malata as well as various Inca and pre-Inca ruins. Save for the aforementioned campsite – which you’ll pass on the first morning – there are no facilities at all in the area
			The Ampato Trail 
				From Lake Mucurca the adventurous, fully acclimatized and well prepared can trek all the way around snowcapped Ampato (four to six days). The Ampato Trail has one very high pass – around 4850m at the crossing of two trails on Cerro Quenahuane, above the Quebrada Condori – and most of the walking is at over 4200m. Local guides are a good idea and you will need food and camping equipment. Be prepared for snow and ice; the weather can change very fast. On the last downhill leg of the trek you can choose to follow trails back to Achoma, Maca or Cabanaconde

	Monasterio de Santa Catalina
		8am–5pm
		S/40
		guides are optional at around S/20 (1hr)
		santacatalina.org.pe
		
		enormous complex of rooms, cloisters and tiny plazas takes an hour or two to explore
		housed almost two hundred secluded nuns and three hundred servants from the late sixteenth century until 1970, when it opened some of its outer doors to the public
		some thirty nuns still live here today
		
		convent was funded by the Viceroy Toledo and the wealthy María de Guzmán, who later entered the convent with one of her sisters and donated all her riches to the community 
		
		most striking feature is its predominantly Mudéjar style, adapted by the Spanish from the Moors, but which rarely found its way into their colonial buildings. The quality of the design is emphasized and harmonized by a superb interplay between the white stone and brilliant colours in the ceilings, the strong sunlight and deep-blue sky above the maze of narrow interior streets.
		
		Los locutorios
			Once you enter, you file left along the first corridor to a high vaulted room with a ceiling of opaque huamanga stone imported from the Ayacucho Valley. Beside here are los locutorios – little cells where on holy days the nuns could talk, unseen, to visitors.
			
		The Novices Cloister and Orange Tree Cloister
			The Novices Cloister, beyond the locutorios, is built in solid sillar-block columns, with antique wall paintings depicting the various qualities to which the devotees were expected to aspire and the Litanies of the Rosary. After passing under the silencio (silence) arch you will enter the Novice Cloister, marked by a courtyard with a rubber tree at its center. After passing under this arch, novice nuns were required to zip their lips in a vow of solemn silence and resolve to a life of work and prayer. Nuns lived as novices for four years, during which time their wealthy families were expected to pay a dowry of 100 gold coins per year. At the end of the four years they could choose between taking their vows and entering into religious service, or leaving the convent – the latter would most likely have brought shame upon their family.
			
			Off to the right, the Orange Tree Cloister (Claustro Naranjal), painted a beautiful blue with birds and flowers over the vaulted arches, is surrounded by a series of paintings showing the soul evolving from a state of sin to the achievement of God’s grace. Graduated novices passed onto the Orange Cloister, named for the orange trees clustered at its center that represent renewal and eternal life. 
			
		La lavandería
			Calle Cordoba runs from the Orange Tree Cloister past a new convent, where the nuns now live. The road continues as Calle Toledo, a long, very narrow street that’s the oldest part of the monastery and connects the main dwelling areas with la lavandería, or communal washing sector, brought to life with permanently flowering geraniums. There are several rooms off here worth exploring, including small chapels, prayer rooms and a kitchen. These dwellings would house one or more nuns, along with a handful of servants, and ranged from austere to lavish depending on the wealth of the inhabitants.
			
			The lavandería itself, perhaps more than any other area, offers a captivating insight into what life must have been like for the closeted nuns; open to the skies and city sounds yet bounded by high walls. Twenty halved earthenware jars stand alongside a water channel (mountain runoff was channeled into huge earthenware jars), and it also has a swimming pool with sunken steps and a papaya tree in the lovely garden. 
			
		Plaza Socodobe and Sor Ana’s rooms
			Broad Calle Granada brings you from the lavandería to the Plaza Socodobe, a fountain courtyard to the side of which is the bañera, where the nuns used to bathe. Around the corner, down the next little street, are Sor Ana’s rooms. By the time of her death in 1686, 90-year-old Sor Ana was something of a phenomenon, leaving behind her a trail of prophecies and cures. Her own destiny in Santa Catalina, like that of many of her sisters, was to castigate herself in order to offer up her torments for the salvation of other souls – mostly wealthy Arequipan patrons who paid handsomely for the privilege. Sor Ana was beatified by Pope John Paul II in the 1990s.

		The refectory and main chapel
			The refectory, immediately before the main cloisters, is deceptively plain, with its exceptional star-shaped stained-glass windows shedding dapples of sunlight through the empty space. Nearby, confessional windows look into the main chapel, but the best view of its majestic cupola is from the top of the staircase beside the cloisters. A small room underneath these stairs has an intricately painted wall niche with a Sacred Heart centrepiece. The ceiling is also curious, illustrated with three dice, a crown of thorns and some other, less recognizable items.
			
			Within the quite grand and lavishly decorated main chapel itself, but not part of the tour these days, are the lower choir room and the tomb of Sor Ana.
			
			Just beyond, Zocodober Square (the name comes from the Arabic word for ‘barter’) was where nuns gathered on Sundays to exchange their handicrafts, such as soaps and baked goods.

		The main cloisters
			The main cloisters themselves are covered with murals on an intense ochre base with cornices and other architectural elements in white stone; the murals follow the life of Jesus and the Virgin Mary. Although they were originally a communal dormitory, their superb acoustics now make them popular venues for classical concerts and weddings and the space can absorb up to 750 people standing or 350 seated around tables.

		Mon–Sat 9am–6pm, Sun 9am–3pm
		S/20
		compulsory guided tour (free, but a tip is expected at the end)
		tours take about an hour
		
		the most important museum in Arequipa: Inca mummies and a range of archeological remains
		guides are obligatory but their fee, which is additional, is negotiable
		
		main exhibit is Juanita, the ancient 13-year-old “princess” uncovered in her icy ritual grave on September 8, 1995, by an expedition that included the archeologists Johan Reinhard and José Chavez, along with the well-known Andinista Miguel Zarate. Her gravesite, located at the incredible altitude of 6380m on Ampato Volcano, is estimated to be about 500 years old. It is thought that Juanita was sacrificed to the Apu Ampato and killed, after a time of fasting and herbal sedation, with a blow to the head by a five-pointed granite mace.
		
		In 1992 local climber Miguel Zárate was guiding an expedition on Nevado Ampato (6288m) when he found curious wooden remnants, suggestive of a burial site, exposed near the icy summit. In September 1995 he convinced American mountaineer and archaeologist Johan Reinhard to climb the peak, which, following recent eruptions of nearby volcano Sabancaya, had been coated by ash, melting the snow below and exposing the site more fully. Upon arrival, they immediately found a statue and other offerings, but the burial site had collapsed and there was no sign of a body. Ingeniously, the team rolled rocks down the mountainside and, by following them, Zárate was able to spot the bundled mummy of an Inca girl, which had tumbled down the same path when the icy tomb had crumbled. 
		
		The girl had been wrapped and almost perfectly preserved by the icy temperatures for about 500 years. It was immediately apparent from the remote location of her tomb and from the care and ceremony surrounding her death (as well as the crushing blow to her right eyebrow) that this 12- to 14-year-old girl had been sacrificed to the gods at the summit. For the Incas, mountains were gods who could kill by volcanic eruption, avalanche or climatic catastrophes. These violent deities could only be appeased by sacrifices from their subjects, and the ultimate sacrifice was that of a child.

		It took the men days to carry the frozen bundle down to the village of Cabanaconde. From here she was transported on a regal bed of frozen foodstuffs in Zárate’s own domestic freezer to the Universidad Católica (Catholic University) in Arequipa to undergo a battery of scientific examinations. Quickly dubbed ‘Juanita, the ice maiden,’ the mummy was given her own museum in 1998 (Museo Santuarios Andinos). In total, almost two dozen similar Inca sacrifices have been discovered atop various Andean mountains since the 1950s.

Colca Canyon Tour: A relaxed mix of bus rides and walking for those who cannot stay 4 or 5 days in Arequipa to do a difficult trek.
	Colca Canyon 2 day tour begins at 08:00am
		The standard two-day tour of the Cañón del Colca costs max S65 per person, depending on the season, group size and the comfort level of the hotel you choose in Chivay. 
		Different agencies may sell you tickets for the same tours, so shop around. 
		All tours leave Arequipa between 7am and 9am. Stops include the Reserva Nacional Salinas y Aguada Blanca, Chivay, Calera hot springs, an evening peña (bar or club featuring live folkloric music; at an additional fee) plus a visit to the Cruz del Cóndor.
		
		2 day classic tour - Too many people
			Cascade of Huaruro, located 2 hours from the Fure village. We then continue 2 hours more to the oasis, where we will enjoy the swimming pools, have dinner, and spend the night.
			The oasis of Sangalle is a great place to relax and appreciate nature, while also to taking advantage of the swimming pools of lukewarm water (18şC). Our guide will be explaining the various native fruits growing in the oasis, such as the lucma, the pacay, and the chirimoya. You will also have the opportunity to taste them.				

	Full day tour begins at 03:00am (stay 1 night Arequipa, do this tour the next day)

	Trekking solo in the well-traveled Cañón del Colca area is popular and easy

	Tips
		Never accept tours from street touts and, where possible, pay for the tours in cash, as occasional credit-card fraud is reported.	
		
	
	!!! - example of return back to Arequipa (buy 2 bus tickets for 7am and 11am, take 7am bus to Cruz del Condor, exit and wait there for 11am bus that comes at 11.30am)

		Convento de Santo Domingo rising imposingly from Q’orikancha's impressive walls - conquistadores made walls lower to make way for their uninspiring seventeenth-century Baroque church – a poor contrast to the still-imposing Inca masonry evident in the foundations and chambers of the Temple of the Sun
				
		Q’orikancha consisted of four small sanctuaries and a larger temple set around a central courtyard. This whole complex was encircled on the inside walls by a cornice of gold, hence the temple’s name (Q’orikancha means “golden enclosure”). During every summer solstice, the sun’s rays shine directly into a niche in which only the Inca emperor (often referred to as the Inca) was permitted to sit. 
		
		Mummies of dead Inca rulers were seated in niches at eye level along the walls of the actual temple, the principal idols from every conquered province were held “hostage” here, and every emperor married his wives in the temple before assuming the throne.
		
		Punchau golden sun disc
			Still visible today, there’s a large, slightly trapezoidal niche on the inside of the curved section of the retaining wall, close to the chamber identified as the Temple of the Sun, where there once stood a huge, gold disc in the shape of the sun, Punchau, which was worshipped by the Incas. Punchau had two companions in the temple: a golden image of creator god Viracocha, on the right; and another, representing Illapa, god of thunder, to the left. Below the temple was an artificial garden in which everything was made of gold or silver and encrusted with precious jewels, from depictions of llamas and shepherds to the tiniest details of clumps of earth and weeds, including snails and butterflies. Not surprisingly, none of this survived the arrival of the Spanish.

	Ollantaytambo
		magnificent Inca ruins	
		
		Legend has it that Ollantay was a rebel Inca general who took arms against Pachacutec over the affections of the Lord Inca’s daughter, the Nusta Cusi Collyu. However, historical evidence shows that a fourteen-kilometre canal, that still feeds the town today, was built to bring water here from the Laguna de Yanacocha, which was probably Pachacutec’s private estate. The later Inca Huayna Capac is thought to have been responsible for the trapezoidal Plaza Maynyaraqui and the largely unfinished but impressive and megalithic temples.
		
		Ollantaytambo was built as an Inca administrative centre rather than a town and is laid out in the form of a maize corn cob: it’s one of the few surviving examples of an Inca grid system, with a plan that can be seen from vantage points high above it, especially from the hill opposite the fortress
		
		the only Inca stronghold to have successfully resisted persistent Spanish attack
			After the unsuccessful siege of Cusco in 1536–37, the rebel Inca Manco and his die-hard force withdrew here, with Hernando Pizarro (Francisco’s brother), some seventy horsemen, thirty foot-soldiers and a large contingent of native forces in hot pursuit. As they approached, they found that not only had the Incas diverted the Río Patacancha, making the valley below the fortress impassable, but they had also joined forces with neighbouring jungle tribes to form a massive army. After several desperate attempts to storm the stronghold, Pizarro and his men uncharacteristically slunk away under cover of darkness, leaving much of their equipment behind. However, the Spanish came back with reinforcements, and in 1537 Manco retreated further down the valley to Vitcos and Vilcabamba. In 1540, Ollantaytambo was entrusted to Hernando Pizarro, brother of the conquistador leader.

		Sacsayhuaman
			daily 7am–6pm
			entry by Cusco Tourist Ticket
			
			steep 40min, 2km climb up to from the Plaza de Armas
			
			megalithic fortress of Sacsayhuaman
			
			The walled complex of SACSAYHUAMAN forms the head of Cusco’s puma (the Inca city
			was designed in the shape of a puma), whose fierce-looking teeth point away from the
			city. The name Sacsayhuaman is of disputed origin, with different groups holding that
			it means either “satiated falcon”, “speckled head” or “city of stone”.
			Once the site of a bloody battle between Inca leaders and the Spanish
			conquistadores, today the most dramatic event to take place at Sacsayhuaman is
			the colourful – if overly commercial – Inti Raymi festival in June (see box, p.218).
			However, throughout the year, you may stumble across various sun ceremonies being
			performed here by local mystics.
			Brief history
			It was the Emperor Pachacuti who began work on Sacsayhuaman in the 1440s,
			although it took nearly a century of creative work to finish it. Various types of rock
			were used, including enormous diorite blocks from nearby for the outer walls, Yucay
			limestone from more than 15km away for the foundations, and dark andesite, some
			of it from over 30km away at Rumicolca, for the inner buildings and towers. First,
			boulders were split by boring holes with stone or cane rods and wet sand; next,
			wooden wedges were inserted into these holes and saturated to crack the rocks into
			more manageable sizes; finally the blocks were shifted into place with levers. With
			only natural fibre ropes, stone hammers and bronze chisels, it would have been an
			enormous undertaking.
			During the fateful battle of 1536, Juan Pizarro, Francisco’s son, was killed as he
			charged the main gate in a surprise assault, and a leading Inca nobleman, armed with a
			Spanish sword and shield, caused havoc by repulsing every enemy who tried to scale
			Muyu Marca, the last tower left in Inca hands. Having sworn to fight to the death, he
			leapt from the top when defeat seemed inevitable, rather than accept humiliation and
			dishonour. After the battle the esplanade was covered in native corpses: food for
			vultures and inspiration for the Cusco coat of arms, which, since 1540, has been
			bordered by eight condors “in memory of the fact that when the castle was taken these
			birds descended to eat the natives who had died in it”. The conquistadores wasted little
			time in dismantling most of the inner structures of the fortress, using the stones to
			build Spanish Cusco.
			The walls
			Protected by such a steep approach from the town, the fortress only needed defensive
			walls on one side. Nevertheless, this “wall” is one of South America’s archeological
			treasures, actually formed by three massive, parallel stone ramparts zigzagging together
			for some 600 metres across the plateau just over the other side of the mountaintop
			from Cusco city and the valley below. These zigzag walls, incorporating the most
			monumental and megalithic stones used in ancient Peru, form the boundary of what
			was originally designed as a “spiritual distillation” of the ancient city below, with many
			sectors named after areas of imperial Cusco.
			Little of the inner structures remain, yet these enormous ramparts stand twenty
			metres high, quite undamaged by past battles, earthquakes and the passage of time. The
			strength of the mortarless stonework – one block weighs more than three hundred
			tonnes – is matched by the brilliance of its design: the zigzags, casting shadows in the
			afternoon sun, not only look like jagged cats’ teeth, but also seem to have been cleverly
			designed to expose the flanks of any attacking force. Recently, however, many sacred
			and ritual objects excavated here have caused archeologists to consider Sacsayhuaman
			as more of a ceremonial centre than a fortress, the distinctive, jagged form of these
			outer walls possibly symbolizing the important deity of lightning.
			The towers and temple
			Originally, the inner “fort” was covered in buildings, a maze of tiny streets dominated
			by three major towers. The tower of Muyu Marca, whose foundations can still be seen
			clearly, was round, over 30m tall and with three concentric circles of wall, the outer
			one roughly 24m in diameter. An imperial residence, it apparently had lavish inner
			chambers and a constant supply of fresh water, carried up through subterranean
			channels. The other two towers – Salla Marca and Paunca Marca – had rectangular
			bases about 20m long and were essentially warriors’ barracks, and all three were
			painted in vivid colours, had thatched roofs and were interconnected by underground
			passages: in its entirety, the inner fortress could have housed as many as ten thousand
			people under siege. At the rear of this sector, looking directly down into Cusco and
			the valley, was a temple dedicated to the sun, reckoned by some to be the most
			important shrine in the entire Inca Empire and the most sacred sector of
			Sacsayhuaman. Excavation of these sites continues, but it’s still very difficult to
			make out anything but the circular tower base.
			The Rodadero, Qocha Chincanas and Calispucyo
			In front of the main defensive walls, a flat expanse of grassy ground – the esplanade –
			divides the fortress from a large outcrop of volcanic diorite. Intricately carved in places,
			and scarred with deep glacial striations, this rock, called the Rodadero (“sliding place”),
			was the site of an Inca throne. Originally there was a stone parapet surrounding this
			important huaca, and it’s thought that the emperor would have sat here to oversee
			ceremonial gatherings at fiesta times, when there would have been processions,
			wrestling matches and running competitions. On the far side of this huge outcrop are
			larger recreational sliding areas, smoothed by the many centuries of Inca – and now
			tourists’ – backsides.
			From here you can see another large circular space called Qocha Chincanas, possibly
			an Inca graveyard, and on its far side the sacred spring of Calispucyo, where
			ceremonies to initiate boys into manhood were held. Excavations here have uncovered
			crystals and shells (some of the latter all the way from Ecuador), a sign usually
			associated with water veneration.
			SACSAYHUAMAN IN NUMBERS
			The chronicler Cieza de León, writing in the 1550s, estimated that some twenty thousand men
			had been involved in Sacsayhuaman’s construction: four thousand cutting blocks from
			quarries; six thousand dragging them on rollers to the site; and another ten thousand
			working on finishing and fitting the blocks into position. According to legend, some three
			thousand lives were lost while dragging just one huge stone.

			The inca site remain somewhat mysterious as to what their absolute purpose was, but it seems likely that they were part of a settlement along a vital Inca road. With the Amazon rain forest to the east of the mountains, it is generally understood that Pisac provided a connecting point of sorts between the highlands and the jungle. As you explore the Pisac archaeological, you will find that the views of the mountains and valleys are simply breathtaking.

			ARRIVAL AND GETTING AROUND PISAC
			By bus Buses are much slower than colectivos, and take
			about 1hr 30 min from Cusco (every 30min).
			By colectivo Colectivo minibuses leave from Puputi in
			Cusco (every 15min; 45min), dropping passengers off on Av
			Amazonas to the west of town. If you’re going to the
			citadel, take a taxi or colectivo from Av Amazonas up to the
			site car park, just below the main ruins. Leaving Pisac for
			Cusco or going on down the valley to Calca and Urubamba,
			if you haven’t got a taxi or tour bus organized, wait on Av
			Amazonas and pick up a colectivo, bus or taxi as they pass.
			On foot If you want to walk up to the citadel from the
			village (2hr or more), start on the path that leads off, uphill
			from Plaza Constitución, along the left flank of Iglesia San
			Pedro Apóstol.
			By taxi Taxis cost S/60–70 one-way from Cusco (45min).
			By tour Many people arrive in Pisac with an organized tour
			from Cusco (see p.221).

			1 day self-guided - Best Option!!!
			
				How To Get to the Trail
					We got a hold of our friend Diego, a Peruvian tour guide, who took us on the trek. With his expert guidance I can now give you the exact directions to enjoy this hike on your own.

					Starting from your hotel, take a taxi to the “Estacion Papitos” (Puputi Estacion de Buses Urubamba y Calca OR Pavitos Colectivo A Ollantaytambo), Cusco’s small bus station. This should cost about 4 soles from the city center.

					Once you arrive at the station you’ll be bombarded with men to help you, so just tell them you need to go to Laguna Piuray and they’ll point you to the right van. The drive to the lake is about 45 minutes and cost us 6 soles per person. Remind the driver once or twice where you want to get off, and they’ll make sure you end up in the right place.

					You’ll get off on a dirt road in a small town. Here you can wave down a taxi (or any car really) and ask them to take you to the “Camino Inca Huchuy Qosqo.” Yep, just like the ancient royalty, you’re going to be doing the whole hike on the Imperial Inca Trail. This 20 minute drive to the trailhead should cost around 10 soles.

					My Tip: Even if this seems complicated (I promise it’s not) whatever you do, DO NOT start your trek in Lamay. DO NOT book with any tour operator who wants you to start your trek in Lamay. Doing this will take something beautiful and enjoyable and totally destroy it. You’ll go from about an hour of uphill hiking to six or more. Trust me, the route from Lake Piuray is the only way to go.

				The Hike
					Start early (we left Cusco at 6:30am) and you won’t see another soul all day.
					
					My tip: Take a few minutes to stop hiking and just listen – the absolute silence and stillness on the roof of the world is a stunning experience.

 
				The Huchuy Qosqo Ruins
					The cost to enter the Huchuy Qosqo ruins is 22 soles per person. 


				The Descent
					This is my least favorite part of the hike and the reason why I rate this trek as moderate instead of easy.

					We left the ruins around 1 pm by passing through them and turning right on the path at the bottom. Soon, you’ll spot the colorful little lego town of Lamay and quickly realize just how high you are.

					Yeah… the decent is over and hour and a half of switchbacks down a sheer cliff face. It’s extra fun because the path is extremely dusty and rocky so you’ll be slipping and sliding right up to the edge for extra fear! Really, it’s not so bad… as long as you don’t look down.

					Once you reach the bottom, turn right to get to the bridge, and once you cross it you’ll come to a bus stop where you can wait and catch the next van back to Cusco. An hour later and you’ll be home!

					The hike to Huchuy Qosqo is totally exhausting but DEFINITELY worth it!

				Guests are collected from their hotel in the morning to start this lovely trek to the little-known Inca site of Huchuy Qosqo, situated on a plateau with stunning views overlooking the Sacred valley and snow-capped peaks of the Vilcabamba range.

				Start your day by driving to the small town of Corao around 30 minutes from Cuzco and the epi-center of all Cusquenan earthquakes before branching off road into the high Andes and the tiny village of Patabamba at 3400m. Here is the start of the local trail to Huchuy Qosqo.

				The trail takes you through small hamlets and affords stunning views of the Sacred Valley and Pisac below. The trail climbs steadily to a Pukamarca pass at 4200m, beyond which you will descend to a beautiful canyon, where a picnic lunch is served. By now you are on the original Inca trail from Cuzco to Machu Picchu until you reach the plateau housing Huchuy Qosqo. The downhill part of the trek down the ravine is about 9 kms.

				After exploring the ruins it is a steep descent to the village of Lamay where your driver will be waiting. This trek is well away from the tourist trail and should last a total of 8 to 9 hours, altough this can be reduced by around 1.5 hours if your vehicle is able to make it to Huchuy Qosqo ruins to pick you up. (This road is commonly blocked by landslips so it is better to expect a descent to Lamay on foot)

				From Ollantaytambo you will catch a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes approximately an 1 hour 30 minutes. You will overnight in a hotel in the town of Aguas Calientes.

				After an early morning pick up from your hotel, you will drive through winding hills towards the Sacred Valley until reaching the Piuray Lagoon, located near the town of Chinchero.
				
				In the nearby community of Tauca, you will start the 8 to 9-hour hike. As you set out on the trail, you will be rewarded with the breathtaking sight of the sun’s early morning rays on Mount Veronica, slowly lighting up the entire Vilcabamba Range.

				You will gradually head uphill towards the Pucajasa Pass, where you will enjoy incredible views of the mountain range that surrounds the Sacred Valley. The crossing at the pass is about 200 meters long, and located at over 14,000 feet (4393 meters).

				From here you will begin to descend again and start to see sections of an Inca trail. Along the way the landscape will change as you head towards lower altitudes. Upon arrival at Huchuyqosqo, located at 12,099 feet (3688 meters), you will stop for a small lunch and snack.  The downhill part of the trek down the ravine is about 9 kms.

				After a short rest, you will begin to explore this archeological complex where you will see well-preserved ruins that are characterized by double jamb doorways, 3-story houses, and mixed constructions of stone and adobe, sprawling over the mountain top and surrounded by spectacular views of the surrounding mountain terrain.

				After exploring Huchuy Qosqo, you will continue hiking across open country before descending along a steep trail into the village of Lamay. Here you will meet your transport and start your drive back to Cusco, returning to the hotel in the late afternoon or early evening.

		involves tough altitude trekking at times, but this is rewarded by spectacular scenery,
		deep valleys, glaciated mountain peaks and remote Inca structures.
		Doing the trail in four days is the preferred option for most, and the most common
		tour length offered by tour agencies. More pleasant still is to spend five or six days,
		taking in everything as you go along. If you can only spare three days, you’ll be pushing
		it the whole way – it can be done but it’s gruelling. If this is all the time you can spare,
		give yourself a head start by catching the afternoon train and heading up the Cusichaca
		Valley as far as possible the evening before. There are 16 campsites along the trail;
		where you stay the night will ultimately be decided by your trail guide.
		INFORMATION
		Acclimatization It’s important to make time to
		acclimatize to the altitude (see box, p.210) before tackling
		the Inca Trail or any other high Andean trek, especially if
		you’ve flown straight up from sea level.
		Costs For a basic Inca Trail tour a reasonable price is from
		around US$450 (low season) to as much as US$650 (high
		season) for a standard three- or four-day trek. If you want
		the best, expect to pay more. Competition between the
		agencies has seen the price drop at times, which tends to
		manifest as a lower level of service and, potentially, lower
		wages for the porters. With the present levels of demand,
		however, prices are tending to rise. Most companies offer
		good value in their guiding service, food, equipment
		quality and the all-inclusiveness of their price. Some
		agency prices include things like transport or entry to the
		Inca Trail and Machu Picchu in their price, and others add
		this as an extra, so check details before booking.
		Porters and equipment Trekking companies will
		organize porters and maybe mules to help carry
		equipment. So many people walk this route every year that
		toilets have now been built, and hikers are strongly urged
		to take all their rubbish away with them – there’s no room
		left for burying any more tin cans. Porters can be organized
		through most trekking companies and they normally
		charge about US$70 for the four-day trek.
		Rules and restrictions The sanctuary authorities (the
		Unidad de Gestión del Santuario Histórico de Machu
		Picchu) have imposed a limit of a maximum of five hundred
		people a day on the Inca Trail (including trekkers, porters,
		cooks and guides). In addition, it is mandatory for trekkers
		to go with a tour or licensed guide (see p.221): the old days
		of going it alone are gone. Be aware that within the
		Santuario Histórico de Machu Picchu, which incorporates
		the entire trail, you must only camp at a designated site.
		Tours Most people select a tour to suit them from among
		the multitude of agencies registered for the Inca Trail (see
		p.221); the company will take care of everything including
		your registration, but demand is so great that it is essential
		to book at least nine months in advance and make your
		booking deposit.
		Websites Check Wmachupicchu.gob.pe for background
		on Machu Picchu, the Inca Trail and alternative sites like
		Choquequirao (see box, p.265).
		When to go Choose your season for hiking the Inca Trail
		carefully. May is the best month to venture on a hike here,
		with clear views, fine weather and verdant surroundings.
		Between June and September it’s usually a pretty
		cosmopolitan stretch of mountainside, with travellers from
		all over the globe converging on Machu Picchu the hard
		way, but from mid-June to early August the trail is simply
		very busy (and the campsites noisy), especially on the last
		stretch. From October until April, in the rainy season, it’s
		less crowded but also, naturally, quite a bit wetter. Locals
		will tell you that the best time to hike the trail is during a
		full moon, and it certainly adds a more romantic, even
		mystical feeling to your journey.
		The main trail
		The usual starting point for the Inca Trail is a small station at the hamlet and bridge at
		Q’orihuayrachina, at Km 88 on the railline from Ollantaytambo and Poroy. Some tours
		arrive here by car and start at Km 82, where the road stops. The train stop is hailed by the
		guards and a small footbridge sees you across the tumbling Río Urubamba. Once over the
		bridge, the main path leads to the left through a small eucalyptus wood, then around the
		base of the Inca ruins of Llactapata – worth a visit for archeology enthusiasts, though most
		people save their energy for the trail and other archeological remains ahead – before
		crossing and then following the Río Cusichaca upstream along its left bank.
		It’s a good two hours’ steep climb to Huayllabamba, the only inhabited village on the
		route and the best place to hire horses or mules for the most difficult climb on the whole
		trail, the nearby Dead Woman’s Pass. This section of the valley is rich in Inca terracing,
		from which rises an occasional ancient stone building. To reach Huayllabamba you have
		to cross a well-marked bridge onto the right bank of the Cusichaca.
		Many groups spend their first night at Huayllabamba campsite, but if you want to gain
		distance and time for the second day, there are three commonly used campsites: one at
		Llulluchayoc, also known as Three White Stones, where the trail crosses the Río Huayruro,
		just half a kilometre above its confluence with the Llullucha stream; another slightly higher
		site, just below Llulluchpampa, where there are toilets and space for several tents; or,
		slightly higher again, actually on the pampa where there’s plenty more camping space – a
		good spot for seeing rabbit-like viscachas playing among the rocks. All of these campsites
		are on the trail towards the first and highest pass, but only the top one is within sight of it.
		The first pass
		It takes five hours or so to get from Huayllabamba to the Abra de Huarmihuañusca,
		the first pass (4200m) and the highest point on the trail. This is the hardest part of the
		walk – leave it (or at least some of it) for the second day, especially if you’re feeling the
		effects of the altitude. The views from the pass itself are stupendous, but if you’re
		tempted to hang around savouring them, it’s a good idea to sit well out of the cutting
		wind (many a trekker has caught a bad chill here). From here the trail drops steeply
		down, keeping to the left of the stream into the Pacamayo Valley where, by the river,
		there’s an attractive spot to camp, and where you can see playful spectacled bears if
		you’re very lucky, or take a break before continuing.
		The second pass
		A winding, tiring track up from the Pacamayo Valley takes you to the second pass –
		Abra de Runkuracay – just above the interesting circular ruins of the same name.
		About an hour beyond the second pass, a flight of stone steps leads up to the Inca ruins
		of Sayacmarca. This is an impressive spot to camp, near the remains of a stone
		aqueduct that supplied water to the ancient settlement (the best spots are by the stream
		just below the ruins).
		The third pass
		From Sayacmarca, make your way gently down into increasingly dense cloud forest
		where delicate orchids and other exotic flora begin to appear among the trees. By the
		time you get to the third pass – which, compared with the previous two, has very little
		incline – you’re following a fine, smoothly worn flagstone path where at one point an
		astonishing tunnel, carved through solid rock by the Incas, lets you avoid an otherwise
		impossible climb.
		The trail winds down to the impressive ruin of Puyupatamarca – “Town Above the
		Clouds” – where there are five small stone baths and, in the wet season, constant fresh
		running water. There are places to camp actually on the pass (above the ruins),
		commanding stunning views across the Urubamba Valley and, in the other direction,
		towards the snowcaps of Salcantay (Wild Mountain): this is probably one of the most
		magical camps on the trail, given good weather, and it’s not unusual to see deer
		feeding here.
		Wiñay Wayna
		It’s a very rough, two- or three-hour descent along a non-Inca track to the next ruin,
		a citadel almost as impressive as Machu Picchu, Wiñay Wayna – “Forever Young” –
		another place with fresh water, as well as the official Trekkers Hostal.
		Consisting of only two major groups of architectural structures – a lower and an
		upper sector – Wiñay Wayna’s most visible features are stone baths with apparently
		as many as nineteen springs feeding them, all set amid several layers of fine Inca
		terracing. Nearby there’s also a small waterfall created by streams coming down from
		the heights of Puyupatamarca. Much like today, it is believed that Wiñay Wayna was
		used by Incas as a washing, cleansing and resting point before arriving at the grand
		Machu Picchu citadel.
		This is usually the spot for the last night of camping, and, especially in high season,
		the crowds mean that it’s a good idea to pitch your tent soon after lunch, but don’t
		be surprised if someone pitches theirs right across your doorway. To reach Machu
		Picchu for sunrise the next day you’ll have to get up very early with a torch to avoid
		the rush.
		Intipunku to Machu Picchu
		A well-marked track from Wiñay Wayna takes a right fork for about two more
		hours through sumptuous vegetated slopes to the stone archway entrance called
		Intipunku (Gateway of the Sun), from where you get your first sight of Machu
		Picchu – a stupendous moment, however exhausted you might be. Aim to get to
		Machu Picchu well before 9.30am, when the first hordes arrive off the train from
		Cusco, if possible.

		Machu Picchu - YES
			machupicchu.gob.pe
		
			Brief history
				The name Machu Picchu apparently means simply Old or Ancient Mountain. With many legends and theories surrounding the position of the site, most archeologists agree that its sacred geography and astronomy were auspicious factors in helping the Inca Pachacuti decide to build this citadel here at 2492m. It’s thought that agricultural influences as well as geo-sacred indicators prevailed, and that the site secured a decent supply of sacred coca and maize for the Inca nobles and priests in Cusco.
		
			The discovery of Machu Picchu
				Never discovered by the Spanish conquerors, for many centuries the site of Machu Picchu lay forgotten, except by local Indians and settlers, until it was found on July 24, 1911 by the US explorer Hiram Bingham. It was a fantastic find, not least because the site was still relatively intact, without the usual ravages of either Spanish conquistadores or tomb robbers. Accompanied only by two locals, Bingham left his base camp around 10am and crossed a bridge so dodgy that he crawled over it on his hands and knees before climbing a precipitous slope until they reached the ridge at around midday.
				
				After resting at a small hut, he received hospitality from a local peasant who described an extensive system of terraces where they had found good fertile soil for their crops. Bingham was led to the site by an 11-year-old local boy, Pablito Alvarez, but it didn’t take him long to see that he had come across some important ancient Inca terraces – over a hundred of which had recently been cleared of forest for subsistence crops. After a little more exploration Bingham found the fine white stonework and began to realize that this might be the place he was looking for.
				
			Origins of Machu Picchu
				Bingham first theorized that Machu Picchu was the lost city of Vilcabamba, the site of the Incas’ last refuge from the Spanish conquistadores. Not until another American expedition surveyed the ruins around Machu Picchu in the 1940s did serious doubts begin to arise over this assertion, and more recently the site of the Incas’ final stronghold has been shown to be Espíritu Pampa in the Amazon jungle.
		
				Meanwhile, it was speculated that Machu Picchu was perhaps the best preserved of a series of agricultural centres that served Cusco in its prime. The city was conceived and built in the mid-fifteenth century by Emperor Pachacuti, the first to expand the empire beyond the Sacred Valley towards the forested gold-lands. With crop fertility, mountains and nature so sacred to the Incas, an agricultural centre as important as Machu Picchu would easily have merited the site’s fine stonework and temple precincts.
				
				It was clearly also a ritual centre, given the layout and quantity of temples; but for the Incas it was usual not to separate things we consider economic tasks from more conventional religious activities. So, Machu Picchu represents to many archeologists the most classical and best-preserved remains in existence of a citadel used by the Incas as both a religious temple site and an agricultural (perhaps experimental) centre.
		
			The ruins
				Though more than 1000m lower than Cusco, Machu Picchu seems much higher, constructed as it is on dizzying slopes overlooking a U-curve in the Río Urubamba. More than a hundred flights of steep stone steps interconnect its palaces, temples, storehouses and terraces, and the outstanding views command not only the valley below in both directions but also extend to the snowy peaks around Salcantay.
		
				Wherever you stand in the ruins, you can see spectacular terraces (some of which are once again being cultivated) slicing across ridiculously steep cliffs, transforming mountains into suspended gardens.
		
				Though it would take a lot to detract from Machu Picchu’s incredible beauty and unsurpassed location, it is a zealously supervised place, with the site guards frequently blowing whistles at visitors who have deviated from the main pathways. The best way to enjoy the ruins – while avoiding the ire of the guards – is to hire a guide at the entrance to the site, or buy the map from the ticket office and stick to its routes.
		
			The Temple of the Sun
				The Temple of the Sun, also known as the Torreon, is a wonderful, semicircular, walled, tower-like temple displaying some of Machu Picchu’s finest granite stonework. Constructed to incorporate polyhedrons and trapezoidal window niches, the temple’s carved steps and smoothly joined stone blocks fit neatly into the existing relief of a natural boulder that served as some kind of altar and also marks the entrance to a small cave. A window off this temple provides views of both the June solstice sunrise and thePicchu. The Pleiades are still a very important Andean astronomical symbol relating to crop fertility: locals use the constellation as a kind of annual signpost in the agricultural calendar, giving information about when to plant crops and when the rains will come.
		
			The Royal Tomb
				Below the Temple of the Sun is a cave known as the Royal Tomb, despite the fact that no graves or human remains have ever been found there. In fact, it probably represented access to the spiritual heart of the mountains, like the cave at the Temple of the Moon
		
			The funerary rock
				Retracing your steps 20m or so back from the Temple of the Sun and following a flight of stone stairs directly uphill, then left along the track towards Intipunku, brings you to a path on the right, which climbs up to the thatched guardian’s hut. This hut is associated with a modestly carved rock known as the funerary rock and a nearby graveyard where Hiram Bingham found evidence of many burials, some of which were obviously royal.
		
			The Sacred Plaza
				Arguably the most enthralling sector of the ruins, the Three-Windowed Temple (Templo de Tres Ventanas), part of the complex based around the Sacred Plaza (Plaza Sagrada), is located back down in the centre of the site, the next major Inca construction after the Temple of the Sun. Dominating the southeastern edge of the plaza, the attractive Three-Windowed Temple has unusually large windows looking east towards the mountains beyond the Urubamba River valley. From here it’s a short stroll to the Principal Temple (Templo Principal), so called because of the fine stonework of its three high main walls, the most easterly of which looks onto the Sacred Plaza.
				
				Unusually (as most ancient temples in the Americas face east), the main opening of this temple faces south, and white sand, often thought to represent the ocean, has been found on the temple floor, suggesting that it may have been allied symbolically to the Río Urubamba: water and the sea.
		
			The Intihuatana
				A minute or so uphill from the Principal Temple along an elaborately carved stone stairway brings you to one of the jewels of the site, the Intihuatana, also known as the “hitching post of the sun”. This fascinating carved rock, built on a rise above the Sacred Plaza, is similar to those created by the Incas in all their important ritual centres, but is one of the very few not to have been discovered and destroyed by the conquistadores.
		
				This unique and very beautiful survivor, set in a tower-like position, overlooks the Sacred Plaza, the Río Urubamba and the sacred peak of Huayna Picchu.
		
				The Intihuatana’s base is said to have been carved in the shape of a map of the Inca Empire, though few archeologists agree with this. Its main purpose was as an astroagricultural clock for viewing the complex interrelationships between the movements of the planets and constellations. It is also thought by some to be a symbolic representation of the spirit of the mountain on which Machu Picchu was built – by all accounts a very powerful spot both in terms of sacred geography and its astrological function. The Intihuatana appears to be aligned with four important mountains: the snowcapped mountain range of La Verónica lies directly to the east, with the sun rising behind its main summit during the equinoxes; directly south, though not actually visible from here, sits the father of all mountains in this part of Peru, Salcantay, a few days’ walk away; to the west, the sun sets behind the important peak of Pumasillo during the December solstice; and due north stands the majestic peak of Huayna Picchu. The rock evidently kept track of the annual cycles, with its basic orientation northwest to southeast, plus four vertices pointing to the four directions.

			The Sacred Rock
				Following the steps down from the Intihuatana and passing through the Sacred Plaza towards the northern terraces brings you in a few minutes to the Sacred Rock (Piedra Sagrado), below the access point to Huayna Picchu. A three-metre-high and seven-metre-wide lozenge of rock sticking out of the earth like a sculptured wall, little is known for sure about the Sacred Rock, but it is thought to have had a ritual function; its outline is strikingly similar to the Incas’ sacred mountain of Putukusi, which towers behind it in the east.
		
			Huayna Picchu
				The prominent peak of Huayna Picchu juts out over the Urubamba Valley at the northern end of the Machu Picchu site, and is easily scaled by any reasonably energetic person. The record for this vigorous and rewarding climb is 22 minutes, but most people take at least an hour. Access to this sacred mountain is restricted to four hundred people a day (the first two hundred are expected to get back down by 10am so that the second two hundred can then go up); register for the climb with the guardian in the hut just behind the Sacred Rock. From the summit, there’s an awe-inspiring panorama, and it’s a great place from which to get an overview of the ruins suspended between the mountains among stupendous forested Andean scenery.
		
			The Temple of the Moon
				Accessed in the same way as Huayna Picchu, but about one-third of the way up, another little track leads to the left and down to the stunning Temple of the Moon (Templo de la Luna), hidden in a grotto hanging magically above the Río Urubamba, some 400m beneath the pinnacle of Huayna Picchu. Not many visitors make it this far and it’s probably wise to have a guide (and if you’ve already walked up Huayna Picchu, you might want to save this for another day: it’s at least another 45 minutes each way and not that easy going at times). The guardian by the Sacred Rock will often take people for a small fee (around US$1/person, provided there are two or more). Once you reach the temple, you’ll be rewarded by some of the best stonework in the entire complex, the level of craftsmanship hinting at the site’s importance to the Inca.
		
				The temple’s name comes from the fact that it is often lit up by the moonlight, but some archeologists believe the structure was probably dedicated to the spirit of the mountain. The main sector of the temple is in the mouth of a natural cave, where there are five niches set into an elaborate white-granite stone wall. There’s usually evidence – small piles of maize, coca leaves and tobacco – that people are still making offerings at these niches. In the centre of the cave there’s a rock carved like a throne, beside which are five cut steps leading into the darker recesses, where you can see more carved rocks and stone walls, nowadays inaccessible. Immediately to the front of the cave is a small plaza with another cut-stone throne and an altar. Outside, steps either side of the massive boulder lead above the cave, from where you can see a broad, stone-walled room running along one side of the cave boulder. There are more buildings and beautiful little stone sanctuaries just down a flight of steps from this part of the complex.
		
			Intipunku
				If you don’t have the time or energy to climb Huayna Picchu or visit the Temple of the Moon, head back to the guardian’s hut on the other side of the site and take the path below it, which climbs gently for thirty minutes or so, up to Intipunku, the main entrance to Machu Picchu from the Inca Trail. This offers an incredible view over the entire site, with the unmistakeable shape of Huayna Picchu in the background.
		
			Machu Picchu Pueblo
				Many people base themselves at the settlement of Machu Picchu Pueblo (previously known as Aguas Calientes), connected to Machu Picchu by bus, in order to visit the ruins at a more leisurely pace or in more depth. Its warm, humid climate and surrounding landscape of towering mountains covered in cloud forest make it a welcome change from Cusco. The town’s explosive growth has pretty well reached the limits of the valley here; there’s very little flat land that hasn’t been built on or covered in concrete. Not surprisingly, this boom town has a lively, bustling feel and enough restaurants and bars to satisfy a small army.
		
			The thermal baths
				Av Pachacutec
				Daily 5am–8pm
				S/10
		
				The main attraction in these parts – apart from Machu Picchu itself – is the natural thermal bath, which is particularly enjoyable after a few days on the Inca Trail or a hot afternoon up at Machu Picchu, although it can get very crowded. You can find several communal baths of varying temperatures right at the end of the main drag of Avenida Pachacutec, around 750m uphill from the town’s small plaza.
		
			Trail to Putukusi
				Closed on rainy days
		
				A trail up the sacred mountain of Putukusi starts just outside town, a couple of hundred yards down on the left if you follow the rail track towards the ruins. The walk offers stupendous views of the town and across to Machu Picchu; allow an hour and a half each way. Note it is not for the faint-hearted as the trail is very steep in parts (some sections have been replaced by ladders) and very narrow.
				
		
		Bus to Machu Picchu
			Head through the market stalls and cross the Río Aguas Calientes by a footbridge.
			
			Tickets can be bought just below this from a small window, where there’s usually a queue to help identify it, and from where buses usually depart. The first buses leave at 5.20am and continue every 10min or so according to demand until about 4pm, returning continuously until the last bus at 5.30pm (S/30 one way, S/60 return).
		
		Hike to Machu Picchu
			It’s possible to walk from Machu Picchu Pueblo to the ruins, but it’ll take one and a half to three hours, depending on how fit you are and whether you take the very steep direct path or follow the more roundabout paved road.
		
		Sunrise over Machu Picchu
			It’s easy enough to get into the site before sunrise, since the sun rarely rises over the mountains to shed its rays over Machu Picchu before 7am. Make your way to the “hitching post” of the sun before dawn for an unforgettable sunrise that will quickly make you forget the hike through the pre-dawn gloom – bring a torch if you plan to try it.
			


		Going to Machu Picchu on your own
			2 Day Bus/Walk
		
			Taking a bus from Cusco all the way to Hidroelectrica (the last train stop before Aquas Calientes) via Santa Maria on both paved and unpaved road. From Hidroelectrica it is a flat 3 hour trek alongside the train tracks and river to Aguas Calientes. Spend the night there before an early start the next day – trekking up the mountain to the ruins or boarding the shuttle bus that leaves every couple of minutes. After visiting Machu Picchu descend the mountain and walk back along the train lines to Hidroelectrica before the long drive back to Cusco. This is the budget option with departures daily. This way of getting to Machu Picchu is not recommended given the dangers associated with the long stretch of unpaved road along a treacherous cliff edge. Prices range from $150 to $200.


		What to bring to Machu Picchu?
			Your passport! You cannot enter without it!
			Your ticket to Machu Picchu and Machu Picchu or Huayna Picchu Mountain.
			Some money for a passport stamp (s/1), the toilet (S/1) and for souvenirs you may want to buy or for dinner or lunch at the restaurant (expensive).
			A camera (and maybe a selfiestick).
			Good walking shoes.
			Water.
			A lunchbox and some snacks.
			Sunscreen and/or small foldable umbrella depending on the weather.


		What not to bring to Machu Picchu?
			Tripods are not allowed to the historical site. You can leave yours in the lockers outside.
			Professional camera’s are not allowed. Permits for professional camera’s are over $300 so avoid bringing a professional looking camera in.
			You cannot come to Machu Picchu with your travel backpack. Only smaller models are allowed so leave your backpack in Aguas Calientes if you’re stuck with it. You can pay a hotel a small amount of money to take care of it.
			Walking sticks are not allowed unless the person needs them.
			Only small foldable umbrella’s are allowed so avoid bringing a big umbrella with spikes.

		Lanchas (speedboats) head daily to the islands of Isabela ($30, two to 2¼ hours) and San Cristóbal ($30, two hours). Both depart at 7am and 2pm. 		
		There's also one boat daily to Floreana ($30, 1¾ hours) at 8am.		
		Advance reservations aren’t required, but it's wise to purchase tickets a day in advance. 
		
			
	Fees & Taxes
        
		The Galápagos national park fee is $100. It must be paid in cash at one of the airports after you arrive, or in advance through a prebooked tour, and you will not be allowed to leave the airport until you pay.
		
		In addition, a transit control fee of $10 must be paid at the Instituto Nacional Galápagos window next to the ticket counter in either the Quito or Guayaquil airports; the charge is already included in the price of many prearranged boat tours.

==================
========Other
            
          
	Water taxis cost $0.60 per person from 6am to 7pm, and $1 from 7pm to 6am.
          
          
	To/From Airport
            
		The airport is on Isla Baltra, a small island practically touching the far northern edge of Isla Santa Cruz. 
		
		If you’re traveling independently, take the public bus signed ‘Muelle’ to the dock (a free 10-minute ride) for the ferry to Isla Santa Cruz. A 10-minute ferry ride ($1) will take you across to Santa Cruz, where you will be met by a CITTEG bus to take you to Puerto Ayora, about 45 minutes to an hour away ($2). This drive (on a paved road) provides a good look at the interior and the highlands of Santa Cruz.
		
		Buses ($2) from Puerto Ayora to Isla Baltra (via the ferry) leave every morning at 6:30am, 7:15am, 8am and 8:30am (schedules change, so verify before showing up) from the CITTEG bus station (Av Baltra) around 2km north of the harbor; a taxi to the station costs $1. If you’re going to the airport to make a flight, it’s a good idea to allow 1½ hours or more for the entire journey from town.


		Buses & Taxis
			Buses from the CITTEG bus station in Puerto Ayora leave for Santa Rosa (about $2) four times a day from Monday to Saturday, and less often on Sunday.

			The most convenient way of seeing the interior (as it ensures you don’t get stuck) is to hire a taxi for the day with a group of other travelers.

			All taxis are pickups, so you can toss your bike in the back if you want to return to Puerto Ayora by pedal power. To Bellavista by taxi is around $3 and to Santa Rosa is around $5 – both one way.

==================!!! MP Plan - May 11



Overall - independent travelers are probably better off visiting the ruins in the afternoon
	Morning 
		everyone who entered on a morning ticket mean that it’s really unlikely you’ll get thrown out - good
		clouds and morning fog early morning - bad
		wake up early morning - bad
		photos (even with fog) - ok
		train ride back - during the day with the views - good
			
	Afternoon - not good!
		best photos - great lighting and the clouds had typically lifted - good
		crowds from 11am - bad!!!
				
	Late afternoon (after 1pm)
		no crowds - good
		4:00 pm - 5:30 pm almost nobody there, not a soul at the top, photographs of Machu Picchu completely empty - good!!!
		no lines - good		
		best photos - great lighting and the clouds had typically lifted - good
		train ride back - during the night with NO views - bad
		maybe: For afternoon ticket they will let you in by 11 am. so we went in at 11 am and stayed until 5.15 pm.
			VZ: we can go to Sun Gate 11.00-14.00

Look for last-minute 5-day cruise
	almost half of the trip (Day 1 & Day 5) will be dedicated to traveling to and from the boat
	3 full days
	best option is your best balance for those who want to see a lot but are still trying to manage their budget prudently

Make no pre-trip arrangements except a hotel reservation for the first night. Find last-minute cruise that can be significantly discounted when booked locally - you can save over 50% and more

Walked into a travel agency first thing in the morning on the second day and inquired about one-week cruises. The agent placed several phone calls, and showed me photos of three boats and their itineraries, all of which departed on different days. I selected my boat, signed the contract, made my payment and boarded a first-class yacht four hours later. The savings: $2,200. It cost me $1300 instead of the $3500

Isabela – San Cristobal
	There is no direct connection

Not a good idea
	You can do this on a day by taking the morning boat to Santa Cruz and then using the afternoon boat from Santa Cruz to San Cristobal

Good idea
	You can do this on 2 days by taking the afternoon boat to Santa Cruz and then using the morning boat from Santa Cruz to San Cristobal


There are some additional costs in Santa Cruz and Isabela, due to the fact that you need to take a water taxi to reach the boat or the dock. This fee must be paid in cash while using the taxi, usually it is around 1 dollar.


The average time per ride for the ferry is about 2 hours
