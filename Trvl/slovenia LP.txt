Soon after the mountain cottage on the alp, we are able to choose the path to the left and then to the right over the peak of Vodični vrh, or to continue along the road right and then along the trail to the Pri Jezeru alp. From there, we ascend the Viševnik alp and Pršivec. We descend down the path leading along the high edge above Lake Bohinj over the Hebat alp to Vogar, from where we return to the starting point via the same path
		Duration of tour: 6–7 hours 
		Dolžina: 15 km

		Lake Bohinj: 5.0   !
		On day one we hiked up to Mostnica Waterfall (beautiful, about 3 1/2 hours hike) and spend a few hours in Lake Bojini to cool down after the hike.
		When you arrive in the small town in the lake, there are a lot of parking spaces around (paid) to park the car. There are a couple of watersport rental places along the main street where you can rent boats. We rented a kayak (about 16 euros for 2 hours) and just paddled around the lake for a couple of hours. 
		We paid 10.50 Euros for 5 hours of parking by the edge of the lake
		Way less crowded than Bled
		I recommend you park your car in Ukanc, a little village at the far end of the lake Bohinj, and walk the trails up to Slap Savica - a beautiful waterfall that bursts through a fissure in the mountain and feeds into the lake. 
		Best park at Ribcev Laz (pay & display), take the boat the Ukanc and walk back on the north shore (no road in the way)
		From Bohinj - do-able hikes for non-hikers are up to Vogar or Dom Ma Komni (for Komni it's a bus or boat to other side of lake then a walk past Savica waterfalls and up). 
		Amazing view from the Vogel mountain at 1535 m. We took the funicular (13.5 Euro). We had a hot cocoa with cream on top and listened to the pleasant Croatian songs
		We reccommended bohinj chees and Mohant chees and Bohinj sausage.
		Detour around the lake can include visiting the Vogel ski center with the cable car(in both winter and summer), to Savica waterfalls and 
		Mostnica Gorge. 
		Expect to spend the whole day walking!! 
		Park at Stara Fuzina and then a steep hike between 1 h 30 to 2 hours to the mountain hut Kosijev Dom na Vogarju for a gulasch soup and apfel strudeln. Make sure to take a short detour for stunning views. You are also able to pay extra at the car park to drive further on a private road.We did that another day and walked to another hut Kosijev Dom Pl. Jezery even higher with snow covered mountain tops and meadows. 
			Google Maps: Kosijev dom na Vogarju (1054 m)
		If you are keen, then a further 30 minutes around the lake will take you to the Savica waterfall (Slap Savica). If you are prepared to climb 500 steps, the views of the waterfall, the lake and the surrounding alps are worth the effort.

		If you are coming to Bled by car, the best is to park a car at one of the parking places in Bled and walk around the town. 
	
	TB
		1. Lake Bled 4.5    ?
		There is not much to do on the island
		September water temperature 20C, in July 22C
		-
		Due to the highly priced car parks of around 2 Euros an hour, we could only afford a couple of hours to see the sights that Lake Bled had to offer. 
		Not much to see. You can go by boat to island witch church or to walk on lake shore
		Parking: 10euros for a day and no hourly option at 2pm 
		traffic jams
		Signage for the hikes around Lake Bled is totally inadequate
		You cannot see anything from the top of the bell tower, then you also have to pay 14€ a person to get there.
		Lake Bohinj slovenia is much better (4 people)
		Crowded
		Parking is difficult after 10am
		+
		check out Vintgar Gorge not too far from the Lake
		You can rent a small boat (5 spots) and paddle from the shore to the small island for around 15 euros per boat/per hour.
		walk around the lake in a couple hours 

		3. Bled Castle (Blejski Grad) 4.0   ?  
		10 Euro to enter castle and views
		-
		Castle is quite small and nothing special in itself
		Visit Predjama Castle instead  
		Long line to get ticket 
		Like others have suggested, there are various view top points that offer you the same views with a free price tag attached around Lake Bled.                                                               +++++++

		Bled to Vintgar hike
			From Bled the route leads north towards the village of Podhom. All along the road there are clear signs for Vintgar, and then by local roads the route leads to the entrance to the gorge itself (3.5 km from Bled)
			The trail runs through the 1600 m long gorge 
			The Vintgar gorge ends at the delightful Šum waterfall, the highest river fall in Slovenia
			At the waterfall the trail rises up a track heading south-east to the chapel of St Catherine above Zasip

		2. Vintgar Gorge (Soteska Vintgar) 4.5    
		4 Euro
		The parking is free
		-
		takes about 2 hours to walk (2way) boring
		A tree branch fell from above and onto a mother (luckily not her young daughter) and was scraped and bleeding a bit.
		You have to go back by the same path 
		Cold inside gorge
		check on maintenance before you go (April 2016 under reconstruction)
		Not as stunning as other gorges I've been in but was worth the 6 euro fare (split between three) 
		the "gorge" is rather small and unimpressive.
		By 9am there were hundreds of people and the carpark was chocker!
		+
		A hike from the end of the trail (well signposted) - about 25 minutes up a small hill, will bring you to Katarina, where you get a bird's eye view of the surrounding area near Bled. From there, through Zasip, you can take a leisurely stroll back to Bled in about an hour and half (downhill and flat)
		lots of trout
		At the end, there is a short track that takes you to a larger waterfall that tumbles into a small pool. Total distance is a little under 2km each way

		Hike to Blejska koča (aka Lipanca) - 1630 m
			From the meeting point at the Center Hotel in Rudno polje we will head off past the Jurček mountain hut to the Viševnik ski slope and turn left before the quarry. After about 800 metres we will turn left off the forest road onto a mountain path, which at first rises rather steeply, but the ascent is not as steep later on. We will cross the slope through a spruce forest, with the path dropping down slightly several times. We will turn right at the crossing and after a couple of minutes of slight descent arrive at the Blejska koča na Lipanci mountain hut, which is open all year round. We will rest for refreshment and sightseeing.
				We will return back to Rudno polje on the same path
				TB !!!
				Walk to Debela peč for 1.5 hrs more OW
					amazing view
					path is well marked
					The path will take you to a saddle between the summits of Brda and Debela peč. 
					Keep to the right and descend slightly towards north-east. The grassy peak of Debela peč is now just a short stroll away.
					From the top return along the same route to the saddle under the summit of Brda. 
					Once there, look for a path that goes in the direction of Brda (a somewhat less visible inscription on a rock). 
					Optional:
						A well-trodden path crosses the southern slopes of Brda and a little later the path to the summit branches off on your right. You can climb it or continue along the same path. 
						Descend a bit until you reach marked crossroad (signposts) just below the ridge. From here you can either go back towards Lipanca meadow or continue along the ridge towards the summits of Lipanski vrh and Mrežce. We suggest that you turn right (northwards) in the direction of the signpost to 'Kovinarska koča' or 'Krma'. The path moves to the north side of the ridge, descends a little and soon you'll reach the next crossroad. Turn left and ascend to the ridge again. 
						Here another path diverges to the left towards Lipanca meadow (no signpost). If you wish to skip the difficult part go left, but if you wish to diversify your hike a bit, you can climb to Lipanski vrh along the ridge. The path is a bit steeper but shouldn't pose any problems to experienced hikers. The summits of Lipanski vrh and Mrežce are very close to each other, but they are separated by a small notch traversable with help of steel cables. Caution is needed!
						From the grassy summit of Mrežce a nice marked trail descends towards south and turns in the direction of Lipanca meadow below you. From Lipanca return to the starting point the way you came.
			Difficulty: easy (Lipanca), medium (Debela peč)
			Length 13km (Debela peč)
			Duration of the trip: approximately 2-3 hours RT (4-5 hrs RT to Debela peč)
				Parking - Lipanca meadow: 1-1.5 hrs
				Lipanca meadow - Debela peč: 1.30 h
				Debela peč - Brda: 45 min

		Hike to Uskovnica Alpine meadow - 1154 m
			From the meeting point at the Center Hotel in Rudno polje we will head off on a forest road in the direction of the Srednja vas village. After less than a kilometre we will turn off the road onto a mountain path and descend towards the Praprotnica Alpine meadow. After about 25 minutes of walking we will stop at the energy spots and, filled with fresh energy, continue on the forest road all the way to the Uskovnica Alpine meadow, where a mountain hut is located. After resting on the Alpine meadow, we will return back to Rudno polje on the same path. Since the path towards Uskovnica descends slightly throughout, the return to Rudno polje will be uphill.
			Difficulty: easy
			Duration of the trip: 2.5 hours RT

		Hike to Zajamniki (also to Praprotnica, Šeh and Konjščica)
			Head southwest from the sports center at Rudno polje along the cross-country skiing tracks. After about 1.5 km a footpath branches off to the left towards Uskovnica (a signpost). It descends a bit to a long meadow. When the meadow gets wider you have two options:
				Go to the right directly towards Uskovnica meadow; the path is quite popular, it takes 1 hour on foot from Rudno polje
					The path to Uksovnica doesn’t need a detailed description since it is well marked
				Go to the left towards Praprotnica or Zajamniki meadows; this path is much less popular, it takes 2 hours on foot to reach Zajamniki from Rudno polje. 
					Turn left at the above mentioned meadow (slightly upwards). Follow a small road and soon reach the first houses at Praprotnica alpine meadow. Leave the road and descend across the meadows directly to the south. Once you get to a flatter terrain you find yourself at a crossroad. The road to the left goes towards Zajamniki alpine meadow, the one leading straight across the meadow goes to Šeh alpine meadow and the one to the right goes towards Uskovnica.
						You head left and start ascending gradually along a forest road. After about 2 km you spot a small signpost that guides to the right and in a moment you find yourself on the beautiful Zajamniki alpine meadow. I suggest you cross the meadow and ascend to the wooden shack on a hill right opposite of the meadow. The view from there is superb!
							The easiest way to return to Praprotnica meadow is down the same path, but the GPS track offers an alternative descent to Šeh meadow which also leads to Praprotnica. When you come to the above mentioned crossroad at Praprotnica meadow again, go along the main road towards Uskovnica (a wooden signpost).
								Before long, the road merges with the popular 'Rudno polje - Uskovnica' path. Continue towards Uskovnica and arrive shortly to this spacious alpine meadow. There is a beautiful wooden chapel on the top of the meadow and a lovely cottage that is often open during winter a bit lower.
									You can either return to Rudno polje along the 'usual' marked path (1 hour) or make a detour across the remote meadows beneath Konjščica alpine meadow.
			Duration:
				Center Hotel in Rudno polje – Praprotnica meadow - Zajamniki meadow: 2 h OW
				Center Hotel in Rudno polje - Uskovnica meadow: 1 h OW
				Uskovnica meadow - Zajamniki meadow: 1 h OW
				Total: 4 h RT
			Difficulty:
				tour is very easy. Orientation from Rudno polje to Uskovnica is not problematic at all since the path is very popular and well marked. The shortcuts leading to Zajamniki and to Šeh meadow are a bit more challenging orientation-wise.

		Duration:

			Slemenova Špica  - Vršič Pass: 1.30 h
			Vršič Pass - 'Erjavčeva koča' hut (past Vršič summit): 45 min 
			Total: 4 h
		Difficulty:
			1 - The entire rout is technically easy
		Starting point:
			Erjavčeva Koča hut
			Google Maps: Erjavčeva koča - Vršič
		Description:
			From the parking lot next to Erjavčeva Koča hut go straight up towards west on a marked path. Ascend to a saddle, where the Mojstrovka ridge finishes. There is a splendid view on the walls of Mt. Prisojnik behind you and Mt. Škrlatica reigns slightly in the distance. Turn right on the saddle (direction Sleme) and descend gently. Along a pleasant path you reach a grassy plateau from where probably the best view on 'pointy' Mt. Jalovec opens, and walls of Mojstrovka rise steeply above you. You are just a stone's throw away from the summit of Slemenova Špica, where the view will drop deep down into Tamar Valley below you.			
			
			You can either go back the same way (easier) or go along a gravel path across scree-slopes just below the walls of Mojstrovka. The path which runs across the scree-slopes is noticeable from Sleme already. Go down southwards (in the direction of the marked path to Tamar Valley) until Slatnica saddle. Turn left here towards the scree-slopes. The path is much less convenient than the one on which you have ascended, but the closeness of the walls will amaze you. There is a chance of snow on this path also during summer and in that case it is better to go back along the 'lower' path. Both paths merge again on a saddle above Vršič Pass. 
			
			To Vršič summit			
				If you are already tired, return directly to the start point, otherwise you can make a nice 'detour' across Vršič and see the walls of Mt. Prisojnik from up close. From the saddle descend to the right to the top of Vršič Pass; then ascend to 'Tičarjev Dom' hut just above the pass and continue on a wide dirt road until 'Poštarska Koča' hut (you will reach it in a few minutes). A grassy summit above the hut is also called Vršič and boasts with a spectacular view in all directions. Return from the summit to the hut, turn left and descend to the starting point ('Erjavčeva Koča' hut) along the beautiful grassy old Vršič road, which was built by Russian war prisoners.

	Heathen Maiden (Ajdovska deklica)	
		Ajdovska deklica is the rock face of a maiden that found its own special place in folk fable. Legend has it that the Ajdovska maidens foretold the people of Kranjska Gora their fortune at birth. They also advised the people when to sow their crops and when to harvest them. One of the maidens foretold the son of a hunter that he would kill the Goldenhorn which inhabited the surrounding mountains. This prophecy angered the other maidens who punished Ajdovska deklica by turning her into rock.

		1. Vrsic 4.5!   
		   Vršič pass is the highest road pass in Slovenia
		If you are up for a beautiful adventurous drive, drive the Vrsic pass. The scenery is stunning and the 50 hair pin turns are manageable. Definitely stop at the historic sites along the route. Be prepared for a herd of sheep to swarm the cars at the top of the pass.
		beautiful sunset and fascinating mountain peaks all around 
		The top is magnificent with a possibility to have snack at the nearby tourist B&B. What is more, tourists may climb various mountains as there are lots of tourist tracks
		If you choose trip to the Vrsic prepare yourself on a road with a lot turns :) But on the end you have a spectacular view.
		If you need some sustenance, whether food or drink, then do make a stop at Tonkina Koča (Tonka's Hut).
		Once you get to the top of the pass, there are some truly magnificent views to be had, especially if you continue on foot up the little pathway on the left of the road. And if you carry on down the other side, you'll be treated to the glorious scenery of the Trenta valley, and the clearest, most azure river you'll ever see!
