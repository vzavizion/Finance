Porto
It would be hard to dream up a more romantic city than Portugal’s second largest. Laced with narrow pedestrian laneways, Porto is blessed with baroque churches, epic theatres and sprawling plazas. Its Ribeira district – a Unesco World Heritage Site – is just a short walk across a landmark bridge from centuries-old port wineries in Vila Nova de Gaia, where you can sip the world’s best port. And though some walls are crumbling, a sense of renewal – in the form of modern architecture, cosmopolitan restaurants, burgeoning nightlife and a vibrant arts scene – is palpable.

PORTO
Opening up like a pop-up book from the Rio Douro at sunset, humble-yet-opulent Porto entices with its higgledy-piggledy medieval centre, divine food and wine, and charismatic locals.
Porto’s charms are as subtle as the nuances of an aged tawny port, best savoured slowly on a romp through the hilly backstreets of Miragaia, Ribeira and Massarelos. It’s the quiet moments of reflection and the snapshots of daily life that you’ll remember most: the slosh of the Douro against the docks; the snap of laundry drying in river winds; the sound of wine glasses clinking under a full moon; the sight of young lovers discreetly tangled under a landmark bridge, on the rim of a park fountain, in the crumbling notch of a graffiti-bombed wall…
History
Porto put the ‘Portu’ in ‘Portugal’. The name dates from Roman times, when Lusitanian settlements straddled both sides of the Rio Douro. The area was briefly in Moorish hands but was reconquered by AD 868 and reorganised as the county of Portucale, with Porto as its capital. British-born Henri of Burgundy was granted the land in 1095, and it was from here that Henri’s son and Portuguese hero Afonso Henriques launched the Reconquista (Christian reconquest), ultimately winning Portugal its status as an independent kingdom.
In 1387 Dom João I married Philippa of Lancaster in Porto, and their most famous son, Henry the Navigator, was born here. While Henry’s explorers groped around Africa for a sea route to India, British wine merchants – forbidden to trade with the French – set up shop, and their presence continues to this day, evidenced in port-wine labels such as Taylor’s and Graham’s.
Over the following centuries Porto acquired a well-earned reputation for rebelliousness. In 1628 a mob of angry women attacked the minister responsible for a tax on linen. A ‘tipplers riot’ against the Marquês de Pombal’s regulation of the port-wine trade was savagely put down in 1757. And in 1808, as Napoleon’s troops occupied the city, Porto citizens arrested the French governor and set up their own short-lived junta. After the British helped drive out the French, Porto radicals were at it again, leading calls for a new liberal constitution, which they got in 1822. Demonstrations in support of liberals continued to erupt in Porto throughout the 19th century.
Meanwhile, wine profits helped fund the city’s industrialisation, which began in earnest in the late 19th century, at a time when the elite in the rest of Portugal tended to see trade and manufacturing as vulgar. Today the city remains the economic capital of northern Portugal and is surpassed only by much-larger Lisbon in terms of economic and social clout.

With the exception of the blockbuster Museu de Arte Contemporânea, Porto’s must-sees cluster in the compact centre and are easily walkable. Many of the big-hitters huddle in the Unesco-listed Ribeira district and Aliados, while hilltop Miragaia has some peaceful pockets of greenery and knockout views. For port-wine lodges aplenty, cross the river to Gaia.
Ribeira
oIgreja de São FranciscoCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Praça Infante Dom Henrique; adult/child €4/2; h9am-8pm Jul-Sep, to 7pm Mar-Jun & Oct, to 6pm Nov-Feb)
Sitting on Praça Infante Dom Henrique, Igreja de São Francisco looks from the outside to be an austerely Gothic church, but inside it hides one of Portugal’s most dazzling displays of baroque finery. Hardly a centimetre escapes unsmothered, as otherworldly cherubs and sober monks are drowned by nearly 100kg of gold leaf. If you see only one church in Porto, make it this one.
High on your list should be the nave, interwoven with vines and curlicues, dripping with cherubs and shot through with gold leaf. Peel back the layers to find standouts such as the Manueline-style Chapel of St John the Baptist, the 13th-century statue of St Francis of Assisi and the 18th-century Tree of Jesse, a polychrome marvel of an altarpiece. The church museum harbours a fine, well-edited collection of sacred art.
In the eerily atmospheric catacombs, the great and the good of Porto were once buried. Look out for sculptural works by Italian master Nicolau Nasoni and prolific Portuguese sculptor António Teixeira Lopes.
oSéCATHEDRAL
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Terreiro da Sé; cloisters adult/student €3/2; h9am-12.30pm & 2.30-7pm Apr-Oct, to 6pm Nov-Mar)
From Praça da Ribeira rises a tangle of medieval alleys and stairways that eventually reach the hulking, hilltop fortress of the cathedral. Founded in the 12th century, it was largely rebuilt a century later and then extensively altered during the 18th century. However, you can still make out the church’s Romanesque origins in the barrel-vaulted nave. Inside, a rose window and a 14th-century Gothic cloister also remain from its early days.
History lends the cathedral gravitas – this is where King John I married his beloved Philippa of Lancaster in 1387, and where Prince Henry the Navigator was baptised in 1394, the fortune of far-flung lands but a distant dream.
oPalácio da BolsaHISTORIC BUILDING
(Stock Exchange; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.palaciodabolsa.com; Rua Ferreira Borges; tours adult/child €8/4.50; h9am-6.30pm Apr-Oct, 9am-12.30pm & 2-5.30pm Nov-Mar)
This splendid neoclassical monument (built from 1842 to 1910) honours Porto’s past and present money merchants. Just past the entrance is the glass-domed Pátio das Nações (Hall of Nations), where the exchange once operated. But this pales in comparison with rooms deeper inside; to visit these, join one of the half-hour guided tours, which set off every 30 minutes.
The highlight is a stupendous ballroom known as the Salão Árabe (Arabian Hall), with stucco walls that have been teased into complex Moorish designs, then gilded with some 18kg of gold.
oMuseu da Misericórdia do PortoCHURCH, MUSEUM
((MMIPO); MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.mmipo.pt; Rua das Flores 5; adult/child €5/2.50; h10am-6.30pm Apr-Sep, to 5.30pm Oct-Mar)
All hail Porto’s newly reopened Museu da Misericórdia do Porto, which harmoniously unites cutting-edge architecture, a prized collection of 15th- to 17th-century sacred art and portraiture, and one of Ribeira’s finest churches, Igreja da Misericórdia. Bearing the hallmark of Italian baroque architect Nicolau Nasoni, the church's interior is adorned with blue-and-white azulejos (hand-painted tiles). The museum’s biggest stunner is the large-scale Flemish Renaissance painting, Fons Vitae (Fountain of Life), depicting Dom Manuel I and family around a fountain of blood from the crucified Christ.
The museum centres on a sky-lit atrium, and a visit begins on the 3rd floor, gradually working down to the church (be sure to get a photogenic glimpse of it from the gallery). It showcases an impressive stash of religious art, most of which has ties to the Santa Casa da Misericórdia (Holy House of Our Lady of Mercy), founded in 1499 by order of King Manuel I. This charitable organisation cared for the infirm, sick and poor for 500 years. On display are portraits of its benefactors, lab equipment (including electroshock apparatus to treat psychiatric disorders), and the treasures it amassed over centuries – sculpture, glass- and silverware, liturgical vestments etc.
The ultimate tribute to this old-meets-new medley is Portuguese artist Rui Chafes' eye-catching, curvaceous iron sculpture My Blood is Your Blood (2015), which hooks through the building to the facade.
oPonte de Dom Luís IBRIDGE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Completed in 1886 by a student of Gustave Eiffel, the bridge’s top deck is now reserved for pedestrians, as well as one of the city’s metro lines; the lower deck bears regular traffic, as well as narrow walkways for those on foot. The views of the river and Old Town are simply stunning, as are the daredevils who leap from the lower level.
Cais da RibeiraAREA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
This riverfront promenade is postcard Porto, taking in the whole spectacular sweep of the city, from Ribeira's pastel houses stacked like Lego bricks to the barcos rabelos (flat-bottomed boats) once used to transport port from the Douro. Early evening buskers serenade crowds and chefs fire up grills in the hole-in-the-wall fish restaurants and tascas (taverns) in the old arcades.
Jardim do Infante Dom HenriqueGARDENS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Ferreira Borges)
Presided over by the late-19th-century market hall Mercado Ferreira Borges and neoclassical Palácio da Bolsa, these gardens are named after the centrepiece statue. Lifted high on a pedestal, the monument depicts Prince Henry the Navigator (1394–1460) – a catalyst in the Age of Discoveries and pioneer of the caravel, who braved the battering Atlantic in search of colonies for Portugal's collection.
Casa do InfanteHISTORIC BUILDING
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Alfândega 10; adult/child €2.20/free; h9.30am-1pm & 2-5.30pm Tue-Sun)
Just back from the river is this handsomely renovated medieval townhouse where, according to legend, Henry the Navigator was born in 1394. The building later served as Porto’s first customs house. Today it boasts three floors of exhibits. In 2002 the complex was excavated, revealing Roman foundations and some remarkable mosaics – all of which are now on display.
Aliados & Bolhão
oMercado do BolhãoMARKET
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Formosa; h7am-5pm Mon-Fri, to 1pm Sat)
The 19th-century, wrought-iron Mercado do Bolhão does a brisk trade in fresh produce, including cheeses, olives, smoked meats, sausages, breads and more. At its lively best on Friday and Saturday mornings, the market is also sprinkled with inexpensive stalls where you can eat fish so fresh it was probably swimming in the Atlantic that morning, or taste or sample local wines and cheeses.
oLivraria LelloHISTORIC BUILDING
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua das Carmelitas 144; €3; h10am-7.30pm Mon-Sat, 11am-7pm Sun)
Ostensibly a bookshop, but even if you’re not after books, don’t miss this exquisite 1906 neo-Gothic confection, with its lavishly carved plaster resembling wood and stained-glass skylight. Feels magical? Its intricately wrought, curiously twisting staircase was supposedly the inspiration for the one in the Harry Potter books, which JK Rowling partly wrote in Porto while working here as an English teacher from 1991 to 1993.
The €3 entry is redeemable if you buy a book.

São Bento Train StationHISTORIC BUILDING
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Praça Almeida Garrett; h5am-1am)
One of the world's most beautiful train stations, beaux arts São Bento wings you back to a more graceful age of rail travel. Completed in 1903, it seems to have been imported from 19th-century Paris with its mansard roof. But the dramatic azulejo panels of historic scenes in the front hall are the real attraction. Designed by Jorge Colaço in 1930, some 20,000 tiles depict historic battles (including Henry the Navigator's conquest of Ceuta), as well as the history of transport.
Rua Santa CatarinaAREA
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
This street is absurdly stylish and romantic, with trim boutiques, striped stone footpaths and animated crowds. It's home to Porto's most ornate tearoom, the art nouveau Café Majestic, and the extraordinary azulejo-bedecked Capela das Almas.
Torre dos ClérigosTOWER
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.torredosclerigos.pt; Rua de São Filipe de Nery; €3; h9am-7pm)
Sticking out on Porto's skyline like a sore thumb – albeit a beautiful baroque one – this 76m-high tower was designed by Italian-born baroque master Nicolau Nasoni in the mid-1700s. Climb its 225-step spiral staircase for phenomenal views over Porto's tiled rooftops, spires and the curve of the Douro to the port wine lodges in Gaia. It also harbours an exhibition that chronicles the history of the tower's architects and residents.
Capela das AlmasCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Santa Catarina 428; h7.30am-1pm & 3.30-7pm Mon, Tue & Sat, 7.30am-7pm Wed-Fri, 7.30am-1pm & 6-7pm Sun)
On Rua Santa Catarina stands the strikingly ornate, azulejo-clad Capela das Almas. Magnificent panels here depict scenes from the lives of various saints, including the death of St Francis and the martyrdom of St Catherine. Interestingly, Eduardo Leite painted the tiles in a classic 18th-century style, though they actually date back only to the early 20th century.

Miradouro da VitóriaVIEWPOINT
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua São Bento da Vitória)
Porto is reduced to postcard format at this miradouro (viewpoint), perched high and mighty above a mosaic of terracotta rooftops that tumble down to the Douro. It's a highly atmospheric spot at dusk when landmarks such as the Ponte Dom Luís I bridge are illuminated and the lights on Vila Nova de Gaia's wine lodges flick on one by one.

Centro Português de FotografiaMUSEUM
(Portuguese Photography Centre; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.cpf.pt; Campo dos Mártires da Pátria; hexhibition hall 10am-6pm Tue-Fri, 3-7pm Sat & Sun)F
This stately yet muscular building (1796) once served as a prison and now houses a photography museum. You actually walk through the thick iron gates and into the cells to see the work, which lends the intriguing exhibits even more gravitas. On the 3rd floor is a collection of cameras spanning every decade; particularly fascinating are the espionage ones, discreetly hidden in everything from Pepsi cans to Marlboro packets.
Immediately south of the museum are the narrow, atmospheric lanes that were once part of Porto’s judiaria (Jewish quarter).
Jardim da CordoariaPARK
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Campo dos Mártires da Pátria)
This pleasantly leafy park is known simply as ‘Cordoaria’. Check out the four haunting sculptures by Spanish sculptor Juan Muñoz. The romantic, narrow lanes that run north from the Cordoaria are the domain of Porto’s hippest bars.

Watching over Gaia is this 17th-century hilltop monastery, with its striking circular cloister, church with gilded altar, and stellar river views. Requisitioned by the future Duke of Wellington during the Peninsular War (1807–14), it still belongs to the Portuguese military and can only be visited on the 40-minute guided tours leaving hourly between 10.30am and 12.30pm and 2.30pm and 5.30pm.
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE
THE ART OF THE TILE

Azulejos (hand-painted tiles) greet you on almost every corner in Porto. One of the delights of taking a serendipitous stroll through the historic centre is the tiles you will encounter. Old and new, utilitarian and decorative, plain and geometrically patterned, they dance across the facades of medieval houses, the walls of cafes and bars, along metro-station tunnels and in opulent church interiors.
Some of the finest tiles grace Porto's churches. Among them is the large and exquisite panel of azulejos covering the Igreja do Carmo. Silvestre Silvestri's 1912 magnum opus illustrates the founding of the Carmelite order and pays homage to Nossa Senhora (Our Lady).
On the Rua Santa Catarina, the Capela das Almas catches your eye with the astonishing feast of azulejos festooning its facade; this stunning frieze by Eduardo Leite recounts the lives of various saints, including the death of St Francis and the martyrdom of St Catherine. The blue-and-white tiles evoke the classic 18th-century style, but actually date to 1929.
Rising high above Praça da Batalha, the elegant baroque Igreja de Santo Ildefonso ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Praça da Batalha; h9am-noon & 3-6.30pm Mon-Sat, 9am-1pm Sun) is another azulejo-bedecked wonder. Some 11,000 blue-and-white tiles, by Jorge Colaço (1932), grace the facade, depicting scenes from the life of Santo Ildefonso and allegories from the Eucharist.
But Porto's crowning glory when it comes to tiles is undoubtedly the resplendent São Bento Train Station, a veritable ode to azulejo art. Spelling out momentous events in Portuguese history, including the Battle of Valdevez (1140), the arrival of King João I and Philippa of Lancaster in Porto (1387) and the Conquest of Ceuta (1415), the friezes designed by master Jorge Colaço in 1930 are so vivid and detailed you can almost here the fanfare and the stampeding cavalry.
Massarelos
oJardim do Palácio de CristalGARDENS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Dom Manuel II; h8am-9pm Apr-Sep, to 7pm Oct-Mar)
Sitting atop a bluff, this gorgeous botanical garden is one of Porto's best-loved escapes, with lawns interwoven with sun-dappled paths and dotted with fountains, sculptures, giant magnolias, camellias, cypress and olive trees. It's actually a mosaic of small gardens that open up little by little as you wander – as do the stunning views of the city and Rio Douro.
The park is also home to a domed sports pavilion, the hi-tech Biblioteca Municipal Almeida Garrett ( GOOGLE MAP ; Jardim do Palácio de Cristal; h2-6pm Mon, 10am-6pm Tue-Sat; W) and the Museu Romântico (Quinta da Macieirinha; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Entre Quintas 220; adult/child €2.20/free, Sat & Sun free; h10am-5.30pm Mon-Sat, 10am-12.30pm & 2-5.30pm Sun).

Down by the river in a remodelled warehouse, this modest museum traces the history of wine- and port-making with an informative short film, models and exhibits, though it doesn’t offer much insight into the wine itself.

At once minimalist, iconic and daringly imaginative, the Casa da Música is the beating heart of Porto's cultural scene and the home of the Porto National Orchestra. Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas rocked the musical world with this crystalline creation – the jewel in the city's European Capital of Culture 2001 crown.
The wonky cuboid conceals a shoebox-style concert hall lauded for some of the world's best acoustics. If your curiosity has been piqued, join one of the daily guided tours.
Mercado Bom SucessoMARKET

( GOOGLE MAP ; www.serralves.pt; Rua Dom João de Castro 210; adult/child museums & park €10/free, park only €5/free, 10am-1pm 1st Sun of the month free; h10am-7pm Tue-Fri, to 8pm Sat & Sun May-Sep, reduced hours Oct-Mar)
This fabulous cultural institution combines a museum, a mansion and extensive gardens. Cutting-edge exhibitions, along with a fine permanent collection featuring works from the late 1960s to the present, are showcased in the Museu de Arte Contemporânea, an arrestingly minimalist, whitewashed space designed by the eminent Porto-based architect Álvaro Siza Vieira. The delightful, pink Casa de Serralves is a prime example of art deco, bearing the imprint of French architect Charles Siclis. One ticket gets you into both museums.
The museums sit within the marvellous 18-hectare Parque de Serralves. Lily ponds, rose gardens, formal fountains and whimsical touches – such as a bright-red sculpture of oversized pruning shears – make for a bucolic outing in the city. The estate is located 6km west of the city centre; take bus 201 from in front of Praça Dom João I, one block east of Avenida dos Aliados.

The hum of traffic on the Avenida da Boavista soon fades as you enter the serene, green Parque da Cidade, Portugal's largest urban park. Laced with 10km of walking and cycling trails, this is where locals come to unplug and recharge, picnic (especially at weekends), play ball, jog, cycle, lounge in the sun and feed the ducks on the lake.
Jardim do Passeio AlegreGARDENS
( GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Passeio Alegre)
A joy for the aimless ambler, this 19th-century garden is flanked by graceful old buildings and dotted with willowy palms, sculptures, fountains and a bandstand that occasionally stages concerts in summer. Listen to the crash of the ocean as you wander its tree-canopied avenues. There's also crazy golf for the kids.
PORT WINE

With its intense flavours, silky textures and appealing sweetness, port wine is easy to love, especially when matched with its proper accompaniments: cheese, nuts, dried fruit and dark chocolate. Ports are wonderfully varied, and even non-connoisseurs can quickly learn to tell an aged tawny from a late-bottled vintage (LBV). For an insightful primer on port, hook onto a tasting at Touriga or Vinologia ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.vinologia.pt; Rua de São João 28-30; h11am-midnight), where the learned owners give an enlightening lesson with each glass they pour. Or sample fine ports by the glass at Prova. From here, head across the Douro to Vila Nova de Gaia, the steep banks of which are speckled with grand port wine lodges – Taylor’s, Graham’s, Croft ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.croftport.com; Rua Barão de Forrester 412; tours incl tasting €7; h10am-6pm), Ramos Pinto ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %936 809 283; www.ramospinto.pt; Av Ramos Pinto 400; tours incl tasting €6; h10am-6pm May-Oct, reduced hours Nov-Apr) and Cálem included.
HISTORY
It was probably Roman soldiers who first planted grapes in the Douro Valley some 2000 years ago, but tradition credits the discovery of port itself to 17th-century British merchants. With their own country at war with France, the British turned to their old ally Portugal to meet their drinking habits. The Douro Valley was a particularly productive area, though its wines were dark and astringent. According to legend, the British threw in some brandy with grape juice, both to take off the wine’s bite and to preserve it for shipment back to England – and, hey presto, port wine was born. In fact, the method may already have been in use in the region, though what’s certain is that the Brits took to the stuff with a passion. Their influence has been long and enduring, a fact that is still evidenced by some of port’s most illustrious names including Taylor’s, Graham’s and Cockburn’s.
THE GRAPES
Port-wine grapes are born out of adversity. They manage to grow on the rocky terraces of the Douro with hardly any water or even soil, and their roots must reach down as far as 30m, weaving past layers of acidic schist (shale-like stone) to find nourishment. Vines endure both extreme heat in summer and freezing temperatures in winter. These conditions produce intense flavours that stand up to the infusions of brandy. The most common varietals are hardy, dark reds such as touriga, tinto cão and tinto barroca.
THE WINE
Grapes are harvested in autumn and immediately crushed (sometimes still by foot) and allowed to ferment until alcohol levels reach 7%. At this point, one part brandy is added to every five parts wine. Fermentation stops immediately, leaving the unfermented sugars that make port sweet. The quality of the grapes, together with the ways the wine is aged and stored, determines the kind of port you get. The most common include the following:
Ruby – made from average-quality grapes, and aged at least two years in vats; rich, red colours and sweet, fruity flavours.
Tawny – made from average-quality grapes, and aged for two to seven years in wooden casks; mahogany colours, drier than ruby, with nuttier flavours.
Aged tawny – selected from higher-quality grapes, then aged in wooden casks for 10, 20, 30 or 40 years (reflected in the price respectively). Subtler and silkier than regular tawny; drinks more like brandy or cognac than wine.
Vintage – made from the finest grapes from a single year (and only select years qualify), aged in barrels for two years, then aged in bottles for at least 10 years (and up to 100 or more); dark ruby colours, fruity yet extremely subtle and complex.
Late-bottled vintage (LBV) – made from very select grapes of a single year, aged for around five years in wooden casks, then bottled; similar to vintage, but ready for immediate drinking once bottled, and usually smoother and lighter bodied.

Now cross over to Rua das Flores, a lovely street dotted with secondhand booksellers, old-fashioned stationers and some enticing cafes.
Near the end of the street is Nicolau Nasoni’s baroque masterpiece, the 4Igreja da Misericórdia, part of the stunning new Museu da Misericórdia do Porto. Cross Largo São Domingos to Rua Ferreira Borges, where you will pass the neoclassical 5Palácio da Bolsa. You can check out its main courtyard – once Porto’s stock exchange – for free or stay on for a tour of its elaborate interior, including its spectacular gilded ballroom. Just next door is the 6Igreja de São Francisco, with a severe Gothic facade hiding a jaw-dropping golden interior.
Head back up Rua Infante Dom Henrique and turn right on Rua da Alfândega, where you’ll find the medieval 7Casa do Infante, the birthplace of Henry the Navigator and the site of some remarkable Roman ruins. Continue into the shadowy Ribeira district, following narrow, medieval Rua de Fonte Taurina as it opens onto the lovely 8Praça da Ribeira. From here, take a stroll along the Rio Douro, admiring Vila Nova de Gaia’s port-wine lodges across the river. Next, walk across the Eiffel-inspired 9Ponte de Dom Luís I to Gaia’s awaterfront esplanade. Grab an outdoor table at one of the waterfront cafes and enjoy the splendid city views across the Douro over a well-deserved drink and some belly-filling petiscos (tapas).

WORTH A TRIP
AFURADA & BEYOND

Sitting pretty on the banks of the Douro, the breezy fishing village of Afurada has remained charmingly oblivious to 21st-century trends. Houses are decked with azulejos (hand-painted tiles) and taverns such as Taberna São Pedro grill fish simply and deliciously on open-air grills. This old-fashioned way of life is depicted in Pedro Neves’ 2007 documentary A Olhar O Mar (Gazing out to Sea).
There are several ways to get here. You can take a tram from Ribeira to the stop just west of the Ponte da Arrábida ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ), then catch a small ferry (one-way per person/bicycle €1/1; h6am-midnight) across the river to the village. Alternatively, buses 93 and 96 from Cordoaria stop just across the bridge in Vila Nova de Gaia. From here, it’s a short walk along the boardwalk to Afurada.
The lure of the sea is tangible in Afurada, with seabirds wheeling in the sky, washing strung out to dry in briny breezes and fishers tending to their nets and preparing their tackle. The river is the lifeblood for locals – stroll the waterfront for broad views of Foz across the water and the hazy smudge of the Atlantic on the horizon. If you arrive early you’ll catch the Mercado de Peixe ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; h6am-7pm Mon-Fri, to 2pm Sat) fish market in full swing. For another snapshot of local life, nose around the Lavadouro Público (Public Laundry; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua da Praia), where donas (ladies) dish out local gossip with their arms immersed in soapsuds.
At the other end of the spectrum is the Douro Marina ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.douromarina.com; Rua da Praia; h9am-7pm) complex, designed by architects Barbosa & Guimarães. A striking vision in glass and steel with forms that resemble boat masts and sails, it harbours a sailing academy, shops, cafes and bike rental.
With your own set of wheels, you can roll along the riverfront to Praia Nova do Cabedelo ( GOOGLE MAP ) in a matter of minutes. Afurada is just 1.5km from this lovely stretch of beach, hemmed by the dunes of the Douro Estuary Nature Reserve. Pedal on another 2km south and you’ll reach the soft, golden, sheltered Praia Estrela do Mar, the best swimming beach in Porto.
Alternatively, it’s around a 40-minute walk, or take bus 902 from Boa Vista bound for Lavadores (via Ponte Arrábida), get off at the pedestrian path and walk 800m south.

8Getting There & Away
AIR
Situated around 19km northwest of the city centre, the gleaming, ultra-modern Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport (%229 432 400; 4470-558 Maia) operates direct flights to major international hubs including London, Brussels, Madrid, Frankfurt and Toronto.
TAP (www.flytap.com) has multiple daily flights to/from Lisbon. There are also low-cost carriers, such as easyJet (www.easyjet.com) and Ryanair (www.ryanair.com), with nonstop services to London, Madrid, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Brussels.
BUS
As in many Portuguese cities, bus services in Porto are regrettably dispersed, with no central bus terminal. The good news is that there are frequent services to just about everywhere in northern Portugal, as well as express services to Coimbra, Lisbon and points south.
Domestic
Renex ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.renex.pt; Rua Campo Mártires de Pátria 37) is the choice for Lisbon (€20, 3½ hours), with the most direct routes and eight to 12 departures daily, including one continuing on to the Algarve. Renex also has frequent services to Braga (€6, 1¼ hours). Buses depart from Campo dos á Mártires da Patria 37.
Rede Expressos ( GOOGLE MAP ; %222 006 954; www.rede-expressos.pt; Rua Alexandre Herculano 366) has services to the entire country from the smoggy Paragem Atlântico terminal ( GOOGLE MAP ).
For fast Minho connections, mainly on weekdays, three companies offer routes: Transdev-Norte ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.transdev.pt; Garagem Atlântico, Rua de Alexandre Herculano 366) runs chiefly to Braga (€6, 1¼ hours) and Guimarães (€6, one hour); AV Minho ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.avminho.pt) runs four times daily via Vila do Conde (€2.45, one hour) to Viana do Castelo (€5.60, 2¼ hours); and Rodonorte ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.rodonorte.pt; Rua Ateneu Comercial do Porto 19) has multiple daily departures (fewer on Saturday) for Amarante (€6.30, one hour), Vila Real (€9, 1½ hours) and Bragança (€14, 3½ hours).
International
There are Eurolines (www.eurolines.com) departures from Interface Casa da Música (Rua Capitão Henrique Calvão). Northern Portugal’s own international carrier, Internorte ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.internorte.pt; Praça da Galiza 96), departs from the same terminal. Most travel agencies can book outbound buses with either operator.
CAR & MOTORCYCLE
All major Portuguese and international car-hire companies have offices at the airport including Cael (%229 964 269; www.cael.pt; Av Arquitecto Fernando Tavora 2021), while some, such as Europcar ( GOOGLE MAP ; %222 057 737; www.europcar.com; Rua Antonio Bessa Leite 1478), also have offices downtown. Prices start at around €30 per day.
TRAIN
There are information points at both São Bento and Campanhã stations. Alternatively, call 707 210 220 or consult www.cp.pt.
Long-Distance Trains
Porto is the principal rail hub for northern Portugal. Long-distance services start at Campanhã ( GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Monte da Estação) station, 3km east of the centre.
Direct IC destinations from Porto include Lisbon (2nd class €24.30, 3¼ hours, hourly).
Urbano, Regional & Interregional Trains
Most urbano, regional and interregional (IR) trains depart from the stunning indoor-outdoor São Bento ( GOOGLE MAP ; Praça Almeida Garrett) station, though all of these lines also pass through Campanhã.
For destinations on the Braga, Guimarães and Aveiro lines, or up the Douro Valley as far as Marco de Canaveses, take one of the frequent urbano trains. Don’t spend extra money on interregional, intercidade (IC) or Alfa Pendular (AP) trains to these destinations as the urbano trains take around the same amount of time; Porto to Braga costs €14.20 by AP train, but around a fifth of that by urbano.
8Getting Around
TO/FROM THE AIRPORT
The Metro do Porto (http://en.metrodoporto.pt) violet line E (direction Estádio do Dragão) links the airport to downtown Porto; change at Trindade onto yellow line D (direction Santo Ovídio) for Aliados and São Bento stops. A one-way ticket costs €1.85 and the journey takes around 45 minutes.
A daytime taxi costs €20 to €25 to/from the centre. Taxis authorised to run from the airport are labelled ‘Maia’ and/or ‘Vila Nova de Telha’; the rank is just outside the Arrivals Hall. In peak-traffic time, allow an hour or more between the city centre and the airport.
STCP (www.stcp.pt) runs a couple of public buses between the airport and the centre; the most useful is the 601 to Cordoaria, departing every 30 minutes from 5.30am to 11.30pm. A single costs €1.85.
BICYCLE
Despite the narrow alleyways, steep hills and cobbled streets, cyclists are ubiquitous in Porto, and there are some particularly great rides along the Douro on dedicated bike paths from Ribeira to Foz or from Vila Nova de Gaia to Afurada and beyond.
Bike rental outlets include Fold 'n' Visit ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %220 997 106; www.foldnvisit.com; Rua Alferes Malheiro 139; rental per half/full day from €13/17), L&L ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %223 251 722; www.lopesrentabike.wix.com/porto; 2nd fl, Largo São Domingos 13; bike hire per 1/24hr €2.50/15; h10am-7pm) and Porto Rent a Bike ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %912 562 190, 222 022 375; www.portorentabike.com; Avenida Gustavo Eiffel 280; bikes per half-/full day from €10/15; h10am-2pm & 3-7pm). A full day's rental will set you back around €15. Many also offer guided cycling tours.
Vieguini ( GOOGLE MAP ; %914 306 838; www.vieguini.pt; Rua Nova da Alfandega 7; bikes per half-/full day €8/12; h9am-7.30pm) has a great selection of high-quality mountain bikes and also rents motor scooters (€28 per day).
BUS
Porto’s transport agency STCP (Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos do Porto; %808 200 166; www.stcp.pt) runs an extensive bus system, with central hubs at Praça da Liberdade (the south end of Av dos Aliados), Praça Almeida Garrett (in front of São Bento train station) and Cordoaria.
Special all-night lines also run approximately hourly, leaving Aliados on the hour and returning on the half-hour from 1am to 5.30am.
City turismos have maps and timetables for day and night routes.
A ticket bought on the bus (one way to anywhere in the STCP system) costs €1.85, or €1.20 with an Andante Card.
CAR & MOTORCYCLE
Driving in central Porto is stressful – avoid it if possible. Narrow one-way streets, construction and heavy traffic can turn 500m into half a morning.
Street parking is tight, with a two-hour maximum stay on weekdays. There is no limit on weekends and parking spaces are more readily available.
Most squares have underground, fee-charging lots – follow the blue Ps. Be aware that opportunistic locals may guide you into places and then expect tips. They can be very disagreeable if you don’t comply. They may also direct you into an illegal spot – be sure to double-check signs.
FUNICULAR
The restored Funicular dos Guindais ( GOOGLE MAP ; one-way €2.50; h8am-10pm May-Oct, to 8pm Nov-Apr) shuttles up and down a steep incline with tremendous river and bluff views from Av Gustavo Eiffel, opposite Ponte de Dom Luís I, to Rua Augusto Rosa, near Batalha and the cathedral. The funicular is part of the Andante Card scheme (www.linhandante.com).
METRO
Porto’s newish metro system (http://en.metrodoporto.pt) is compact and fairly easy to navigate – though not comprehensive. It comprises six metropolitan lines that all converge at the Trindade stop.
Three lines – Linha A (blue, to Matosinhos), Linha B (red, to Vila do Conde and Póvoa de Varzim) and Linha C (green, to Maia) – run from Estádio do Dragão via Campanhã train station through the city centre, and then on to far-flung northern and western suburbs.
Linha D (yellow) runs north–south from Hospital São João to João de Deus in Vila Nova de Gaia, crossing the upper deck of Ponte de Dom Luís I. Key stops include Aliados and São Bento station.
Linha E (violet) connects Linha B with the airport.
Linha F (orange) links Senhora da Hora to Fânzeres.
Tickets cost €1.20/1.50/1.85 for zone 2/3/4 with an Andante Card. Zone 2 covers the whole city centre east to Campanhã train station, south to Vila Nova de Gaia and west to Foz do Douro.
Buy tickets from metro ticket machines, which have English-language menus. All stations also have maps.
For timetables, maps and fares, visit the metro website.
The metro runs from around 6am to 1am daily.
TAXI
There are taxi ranks throughout the centre, or you can call Táxis Invicta (%225 076 400). Count on paying around €5 to €7 for trips within the centre during the day, with a 20% surcharge at night. There’s an extra charge if you leave the city limits, which includes Vila Nova de Gaia.
TRAM
Only three Porto tram lines remain, but they’re very scenic.
The Massarelos stop, on the riverfront near the foot of the Palácio de Cristal, is the tram system’s hub. From here, line 1 trundles along the river to nearby Praça Infante Dom Henrique (Ribeira). Line 1E (appears as a crossed-out ‘1’) heads down the river in the opposite direction, towards Foz do Douro.
Line 18 heads uphill to the Igreja do Carmo and Jardim do Cordoaria.
Line 22 makes a loop through the centre from Carmo to Batalha/Guindais.
Trams run approximately every 30 minutes from 8am to 9pm.
One-way tickets cost €2.50; a day pass costs €8.
ANDANTE CARD

AFor maximum convenience, Porto’s transport system offers the rechargeable Andante Card (www.linhandante.com), allowing smooth movement between tram, metro, funicular and many bus lines.
AThe card itself costs only €0.60 and can be recharged for one year. Once you’ve purchased the card, charge it with travel credit according to which zones you will be travelling in.
APurchase credit at metro ticket machines and staffed TIP booths at central hubs such as Casa da Música and Trindade, as well as the STCP office, the funicular, the electric tram museum and a scattering of other authorised sales points.
AYour time begins from when you first enter the vehicle or platform: just wave the card in front of a validation machine marked ‘Andante’.
AEach trip allows you to move between methods of transport without additional cost.

Sipping the Douro
The exquisite Alto Douro wine country is the oldest demarcated wine region on earth. Its steeply terraced hills, stitched together with craggy vines that have produced luscious wines for centuries, loom either side of the Rio Douro. Whether you get here by driving the impossibly scenic back roads, or by train or boat from Porto, take the time to hike, cruise and taste. Countless vintners receive guests for tours, tastings and overnight stays, and if you find one that’s still family owned, you may sample something very old and very special.

Braga
Portugal’s third-largest city is blessed with terrific restaurants, a vibrant university and raucous festivals, but when it comes to historic sites it is unparalleled in Portugal. Here’s the remarkable 12th-century cathedral, there’s a 14th-century church. Braga has not one but two sets of Roman ruins, countless 17th-century plazas and an 18th-century palace turned museum. Then there’s that splendid baroque staircase: Escadaria do Bom Jesus, the target of penitent pilgrims who come to make offerings at altars on the way to the mountaintop throughout the year.

Coimbra
The medieval capital of Portugal for over a hundred years, and site of the country’s greatest university for the past five centuries, Coimbra wears its weighty importance in Portuguese history with dignity. Its atmospheric, beautiful historic core cascades down a hillside in a lovely setting on the east bank of the Rio Mondego: it's a multicoloured collage of buildings spanning nearly a millennium.
During the academic year, you’ll be sure to feel the university’s influence. Students throng bars and cafes, and graffiti scrawled outside Repúblicas (communal student dwellings) address the political issues of the day. On a summer evening, the city’s old stone walls reverberate with the haunting metallic notes of the guitarra (Portuguese guitar) and the full, deep voices of fado singers.
Then there's the city’s modern side – a contemporary riverfront park with terrace bars and restaurants, a spiffy pedestrian bridge across the Mondego, and vast shopping complexes.
History
The Romans founded a city at Conímbriga, though it was abruptly abandoned in favour of Coimbra’s more easily defended heights. The city grew and prospered under the Moors, who were evicted definitively by Christians in 1064. The city served as Portugal’s capital from 1139 to 1255, when Afonso III decided he preferred Lisbon.
The Universidade de Coimbra, Portugal’s first university (and among the first in Europe), was actually founded in Lisbon by Dom Dinis in 1290 but settled here in 1537. It attracted a steady stream of teachers, artists and intellectuals from across Europe. The 16th century was a particularly heady time thanks to Nicolas Chanterène, Jean de Rouen (João de Ruão) and other French artists who helped create a school of sculpture here that influenced styles all over Portugal.
Today Coimbra’s university remains Portugal’s most prestigious – and one of its most traditional. Students still attend class in black robes and capes – often adorned with patches signifying course of study, home town or other affiliation – while a rigorously maintained set of rites and practices called the codigo de praxe governs all aspects of student life.

Crowning Coimbra’s steep hilltop is the university, around and below which lies a tangle of old town lanes. The new town, locally called ‘Baixa’, spreads at the foot of the hill and along the Rio Mondego.
The city also makes a fine base for day visits to the remarkable Roman ruins at Conímbriga, the medieval hilltop fortress of Montemor-o-Velho or the outlandishly ornate Palace Hotel do Buçaco.
Upper Town
Long a Moorish stronghold and for a century the seat of Portugal’s kings, Coimbra’s upper town rises abruptly from the banks of the Rio Mondego. The most picturesque way to enter Coimbra’s labyrinth of lanes is via Arco de Almedina ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ) – the city’s heavy-duty Moorish gateway – and up the staggered stairs known as Rua Quebra Costas ('Backbreaker').
People have been gasping up this hill (and falling down it) for centuries; local legend says that it was the 19th-century writer Almeida Garrett who persuaded the mayor to install the stairs.
Up Rua Sub Ripas is the grand Manueline doorway of the early-16th-century Palácio de Sub Ripas ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Sub Ripas), signposted Torre da Contenda; its Renaissance windows and stone ornaments are the work of Jean de Rouen, whose workshop was nearby. Further on is the Torre de Anto, a tower that once formed part of the town walls and recently opened as the Núcleo da Guitarra e do Fado de Coimbra (Guitar and Fado of Coimbra Centre).
For a glimpse of student life, stroll along any of the alleys around the Sé Velha (old cathedral) or below the Sé Nova (new cathedral). Flags, offbeat art and graffiti mark the cramped houses known as Repúblicas, each housing a dozen or so students from the same region or faculty.
oUniversidade de CoimbraUNIVERSITY
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %239 242 744; www.uc.pt/en/informacaopara/visit/paco; adult/student €9/7, tower €1; h9am-7.30pm mid-Mar–Oct, 9.30am-1pm & 2-5.30pm Nov–mid-Mar)
The city’s high point, the university nucleus, consists of a series of remarkable 16th- to 18th-century buildings, all set within and around the vast Páteo das Escolas ('patio' or courtyard). These include the Paço das Escolas (Royal Palace), clock tower, Prisão Acadêmica (prison), Capela de São Miguel (chapel) and Biblioteca Joanina (library). Visitors to the library are admitted in small groups every 20 minutes. Buy your ticket at the university's visitor centre near the Porta Férrea. With the exception of the library, you can enter and explore on your own, or head off with a knowledgable university tour guide on one of three different tours (€12.50/15/20). These take place daily at 11am and 3pm.
oSé VelhaCATHEDRAL
(Old Cathedral; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %239 825 273; www.sevelha-coimbra.org; Largo da Sé Velha, Rua do Norte 4; €2.50; h10am-6pm Mon-Sat, 1-6pm Sun)
Coimbra's stunning 12th-century cathedral is one of Portugal's finest examples of Romanesque architecture. The main portal and facade are exceptionally striking. Its crenellated exterior and narrow, slit-like lower windows serve as reminders of the nation's embattled early days, when the Moors were still a threat. These buildings were designed to be useful as fortresses in times of trouble.
The church was financed by the first king of Portugal, Afonso Henriques. The high, barrel-vaulted nave preserves its main Romanesque features; side altars and well-preserved Gothic tombs of bishops are backed by bright Andalusian tiles. The high gilt retable is in ornate late-Gothic style and depicts the Assumption of Mary. Contrast this with the Renaissance Capela do Santíssimo Sacramento alongside. If you want to visit on a Sunday, note that Mass is at 11am.
oMuseu Nacional de Machado de CastroMUSEUM
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %239 853 070; www.museumachadocastro.pt; Largo Dr José Rodrigues; adult/child €6/free, cryptoportico only €3, with audio guide €7.50; h2-6pm Tue, 10am-7pm Wed-Sun Apr-Sep, 2-6pm Tue, 10am-6pm Wed-Sun Oct-Mar)
This great museum is a highlight of central Portugal. It's built over the Roman forum, the remains of which can be seen and cover several levels. Part of the visit takes you down to the vaulted, spooky and immensely atmospheric galleries of the cryptoportico that allowed the forum to be level on such a hilly site. The artistic collection is wide-ranging and superb. The route starts with sculpture, from the architectural (column capitals) through Gothic religious sculpture and so on.
Highlights include a section of the delicate cloister of São João de Almedina and some exquisite alabaster pieces from England. Renaissance masters arriving in Coimbra from other parts of Europe brought their own styles and contributed to the establishment of a distinctive Coimbra tradition. A whole chapel has even been reassembled here. The section downstairs includes impressive 16th-century terracotta figures from Hodart's Last Supper, while paintings on the higher floors include stunning Flemish panels by Metsys. A collection of gold monstrances, furniture and Moorish-influenced pieces are almost too much by the time you reach them.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %239 854 350; www.museudaciencia.org; Largo Marquês de Pombal; adult/student €5/3.50; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun)
This wonderful science museum occupies a centuries-old former monastery converted by Pombal into the university’s chemical engineering building. It features intriguing state-of-the-art interactive science displays coexisting with 18th-century lab sinks; don’t miss the giant glowing globe in a room paved with medieval stones, or the psychedelic insect’s-eye view of flowers. Displays are in English/Portuguese. There's also a great cafe with terrace and views down to the new town.
The most extraordinary section, only reopened in 2016, is housed in a building opposite (guided visits only). The collection displays 17th- to 19th-century teaching aids of the former physics and zoology study laboratories. Think curiosity cabinets and some of the most simple, ingenious scientific contraptions around (we love the centaur used to measure the direction and velocity of an arrow). Part of the joy, too, is observing the exquisite artisanship.

The large, severe 'new' cathedral, started by the Jesuits in 1598 and completed a century later, dominates the square of the same name high in the old town. Its sober Renaissance lines contrast with the gilt side panels and ornate baroque altarpiece. Down the side is a gallery of reliquaries featuring bones and worse from minor saints and bishops, including St Francis Xavier and St Luke (so it is claimed!). Climb to the platform for uplifting city views.
Porta FérreaGATE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
One of the most symbolic aspects of the university, the main entrance (Iron Gate) was designed by architect António Tavares in 1634 on the orders of Rector D Álvaro da Costa. It occupies the same site as the main gate to Coimbra’s Moorish stronghold and was the first major work following the acquisition of the Royal Palace by King Felipe I in 1597.
Statue of João IIISTATUE
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Located in the middle of the university square, João III turns his back on a sweeping view of the city and the river and faces the centre of learning. It was he who re-established the university in Coimbra in 1537 and invited big-shot scholars to teach here in what had previously been a royal palace.
Clock TowerTOWER
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Another of the university's symbolic structures in Coimbra, the 18th-century tower – and its clock and bells – regulate academic life. Built between 1728 and 1733, on the premise that there could be no order without a clock, it was nicknamed 'a cabra' ('goat'; or 'bitch' in contemporary lingo), as it rang out to end the day's classes, signifying the curfew (in the days when students had to be home by 7pm or face prison) and that there would be classes the following day.
In fine conditions, you can climb the tower (€1).
Paço das EscolasNOTABLE BUILDING
(Royal Palace; MAP GOOGLE MAP )
The Schools Palace, the original Royal Palace, houses the university's iconic salas. Here, important traditional academic ceremonies still take place. To visit the palace, from the courtyard gate take the stairway on the right up to Sala dos Capelos (named after the academic cape used by the university’s Doctors; also known as the Grand Hall), a former examination room hung with dark portraits of Portugal’s kings and heavy quiltlike decoration. Nearby is the private Examination Room, lined with paintings of the university rectors.
The adjacent passageway affords visitors excellent city views. In fine weather you may be permitted to enter the balcony, worth doing for fabulous vistas.

This extraordinarily beautiful, ornate baroque chapel has a brightly painted ceiling, ornate tilework, Manueline features and a gilded organ. It was reopened (in March 2016) after a year of renovation. Concerts still take place here on occasion – ask at the turismo.
Biblioteca JoaninaLIBRARY
(João V Library; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %239 859 818; Universidade de Coimbra; h9am-7.30pm mid-Mar–Oct, 9.30am-1pm & 2-5.30pm Nov–mid-Mar)
This extraordinary library, a gift from João V in the early 18th century, seems too extravagant and distracting for study, with its rosewood, ebony and jacaranda tables, elaborately frescoed ceilings and gilt chinoiserie bookshelves. Its 60,000 ancient books deal with law, philosophy and theology. A lower floor has more tomes and the Prisão Acadêmica, a lock-up for misbehaving students.
Prisão AcadêmicaNOTABLE BUILDING
( MAP GOOGLE MAP )
Below the Biblioteca Joanina is this evocative place: a former lock-up for misbehaving students. Originally located beneath the Sala dos Capelos, the academic lock-up was later transferred back to the medieval jail of the Royal Palace below the library (incredibly, the university was able to operate its own separate laws). In 1834, after the liberal revolution in Portugal, the prison was used as a safe deposit for books and illuminated manuscripts of convents and monasteries.
Núcleo da Guitarra e do Fado de Coimbra/Torre de AntoMUSEUM
(Guitar and Fado of Coimbra Centre; MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Sub Ripas; h10am-1pm & 2-6pm Tue-Sun)F
On Rua Sub Ripas in Coimbra's upper town is the Torre de Anto, a tower that once formed part of the ancient city walls. The poet António Nobre (1867–1900) lived here in the late 19th century, thus the tower's name. Since 2015 the Torre de Anto has housed the Núcleo da Guitarra e do Fado de Coimbra, part of the Municipal Museum network.
FIRED UP

In the first week of May, Coimbra marks the end of the academic year with Queima das Fitas, a week-long party that serves as the country’s biggest and best excuse to get roaring drunk. Literally, the name means ‘Burning of the Ribbons’, because graduates ritually torch the colour-coded ribbons worn to signify particular courses of study.
In the wee hours of Friday morning, the Queima kicks off with the Serenata Monumental, a hauntingly beautiful midnight fado performance on the steps of the Sé Velha. The agenda continues with sports events, private black-tie balls, nightly concerts at the so-called Queimodromo across the Ponte de Santa Clara, and a beer-soaked Sunday-afternoon parade called the Cortejo dos Grelados that runs from the university down to Largo da Portagem.
In their rush to sponsor the various festivities, Portuguese breweries provide ultracheap beer, which is distributed and drunk in liberal quantities.
Baixa & Around

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Praça 8 de Maio; adult/student €2.50/1.50; h9am-5pm Mon-Fri, 9am-noon & 2-5pm Sat, 4-5.30pm Sun)
From the trendy shops outside, this church plunges you back to Portugal's past. Step through the Renaissance porch and flamboyant 18th-century arch to discover some of the Coimbra School's finest work, including an ornate pulpit and the elaborate tombs of Portugal's first kings, Afonso Henriques and Sancho I. The most striking Manueline work is in the restrained 16th-century cloister.
Behind the church is the Jardim da Manga ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Olímpio Nicolau Rui Fernandes), once part of the cloister, and its curious fountain: a lemon-yellow, four-buttressed affair.
Núcleo da Cidade Muralhada/Torre de AlmedinaMUSEUM

Housed in the medieval tower directly above the Arco de Almedina, this historical museum displays a plaster reproduction of Coimbra’s old-town layout, complete with castle. A multilingual audiovisual presentation takes you step by step around the 2km of walls. There's an exhibition and city views upstairs, but the real fun is looking down through the matacães (embrasures), through which hot oil was traditionally poured on enemies below.
Praça da República & Around
Leafy Praça da República is a social centre, especially for students. The surrounding neighbourhood, laid out in the 19th century and still dominated by prim bourgeois homes of the period, is a relaxing break from the high density of both the university and the Baixa area.
Jardim BotânicoGARDENS
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %239 855 233; www.uc.pt; h9am-8pm Apr-Sep, 9am-5.30pm Oct-Mar)F
A serene place to catch your breath, the lovely university-run botanic garden sits in the shadow of the 16th-century Aqueduto de São Sebastião. Founded by the Marquês de Pombal, the garden combines formal flower beds, meandering paths and elegant fountains.
The green-fingered can also visit the lush greenhouses (closed at the time of research) and the adjacent Museu Botânico, while Skygarden has a series of ziplines here.
Casa Museu Bissaya BarretoMUSEUM

Bissaya Barreto was a local surgeon, scholar and obsessive hoarder of fine arts, and his handsome, late-19th-century mansion has been turned into an art museum. A guide (not necessarily English-speaking) accompanies guests through rooms jam-packed with Portuguese sculpture and painting, Chinese porcelain, old azulejos (hand-painted tiles) and period furniture.
Along & Across the River
In an ecclesiastical counterweight to the university, a cluster of convents, together with several other sights, sits on the far side of the Rio Mondego. Lovely green spaces stretch south from the Ponte de Santa Clara along the eastern bank of the river. Parque Dr Manuel Braga ( GOOGLE MAP ) provides a haven of serene shade under stately rows of old sycamores, while the Parque Verde do Mondego ( GOOGLE MAP ; www.parqueverdedomondego.pt; c) features riverfront bars and eateries, a pedestrian bridge across the Rio Mondego and a small playground for kids.

( GOOGLE MAP ; %239 801 160; Rua das Parreiras; adult/student €4/2.50; h10am-7pm Tue-Sun Apr-Sep, 10am-6pm Tue-Sun Oct-Mar)
This Gothic convent was founded in 1330 by the saintly Dona Isabel, Dom Dinis’ wife; it served as her final resting place until flooding forced her to be moved uphill. The adjacent museum displays archaeological finds and shows two films, one about the nuns who lived here, the other documenting the 20-year renovation that cleared the river ooze that had drowned it since the 17th century.

Begun on higher ground in the 17th century to replace its flooded twin, this convent is devoted almost entirely to the saintly Queen Isabel’s memory. Aisle panels tell her life story, while her solid-silver casket is enshrined above the altar, and even her clothes hang in the sacristy. Her statue is the focus of the Festa da Rainha Santa.

The brainchild of local collector Bissaya Barreto, this is an impossibly cute theme park where kids clamber over, into and through doll’s-house versions of Portugal’s most famous monuments, while parents clutch cameras at the ready. There’s an extra charge to visit marginally interesting minimuseums of marine life, clothing and furniture.

Legend says Dona Inês de Castro met her grisly end in the gardens of this private estate. It’s now a deluxe hotel, although anyone can take a turn about the grounds and track down the Fonte dos Amores (Lovers’ Fountain), which reputedly marks the spot where the prince's unwitting mistress was struck down. Also note the sequoia tree planted by the Duke of Wellington.

8Getting There & Away
BUS
From the rather grim bus station ( GOOGLE MAP ; Av Fernão de Magalhães), a 15-minute walk northwest of the centre, Rede Expressos ( GOOGLE MAP ; %239 855 270; www.rede-expressos.pt) runs at least a dozen buses daily to Lisbon (€14.50, 2½ hours) and to Porto (€12, 1½ hours), with almost as many to Braga (€14, 2¾ hours) and to Faro (€27, six to nine hours). There’s also a regular service (more frequent in summer) that runs to Seia (€10, 1¾ hours), Guarda (€13.10, two to three hours) and other points around the Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela.
TRAIN
Long-distance trains stop only at Coimbra B station, north of the city. Cross the platform for quick, free connections to more-central Coimbra A (called just 'Coimbra' on timetables).
Coimbra is linked by regular Alfa Pendular (AP) and intercidade (IC) trains to Lisbon (AP/IC €22.80/19.20, 1¾/two hours) and Porto (€16.70/13.20, one/1¼ hours); IC trains also stop at intermediate destinations north and south. Trains run roughly hourly to Figueira da Foz (€2.65, one hour) and Aveiro (€5.25, one hour).
8Getting Around
BICYCLE
Electronic bikes are available from E.Tour (%926 646 711; www.etour.pt; per bike 3/6/12hr €12/20/35, 2-person minimum).
BUS
Between them, buses 27, 28 and 29 run about every half hour from the main bus station and the Coimbra B train station to Praça da República.

Tickets bought on board cost €1.60 per trip.
You’ll also see patufinhas (electric minibuses) crawling around pedestrian areas in the centre of Coimbra, between Baixa and Alta Coimbra and through the medieval heart of the city. These accept the same tickets as other SMTUC buses.
ELEVADOR DO MERCADO
The Elevador ( GOOGLE MAP ; 1hr ticket €1.50, 3/5/10 trips €2.20/3.15/5.80; h7.30am-9pm Mon-Sat, 10am-9pm Sun) – a double elevator connected by walkway, between the market and the university – can save you an uphill climb. Use city bus tickets or buy a ticket from the lift operator.
Around Coimbra
Conímbriga
oConímbriga Roman RuinsRUINS
(ruins & museum adult/child €4.50/free; h10am-7pm)
In the rolling country southwest of Coimbra, Conímbriga boasts Portugal’s most extensive Roman ruins, one of the best-preserved sites on the Iberian Peninsula. It tells the poignant tale of a town that, after centuries of security, was split in two by quickly erected walls and then entirely abandoned as the Roman Empire disintegrated.
Elaborate mosaics, heated baths and fountains evoke toga-clad dalliances. Through the middle of this runs a massive defensive wall, built in haste to fend off raids.
To get your head around Conímbriga's fascinating history, begin (or end) at the renovated four-room museum. Displays present every aspect of Roman life from mosaics (including the amazing minotaur mosaic) to medallions.
Conímbriga actually dates back to Celtic times (briga is a Celtic term for a defended area). But when the Romans settled here in the 1st century AD, it blossomed into a major city on the route from Lisbon (Olisipo) to Braga (Bracara Augusta). Its prosperity is revealed by well-to-do mansions carpeted with elaborate mosaics and scattered with fountains.
In the 3rd century the townsfolk, threatened by invading tribes, desperately threw up a huge defensive wall right through the town centre, abandoning the residential area. But this wasn’t enough to stop the Suevi (Sueves) seizing the town in 468. Inhabitants fled to nearby Aeminius (Coimbra) – thereby saving Conímbriga from destruction.
Once in the ruins (50m from the museum), the disproportionately large wall will first draw your attention, followed by the patchwork of exceptional mosaic floors below it. Here you’ll find the fabulous Casa dos Repuxos (House of Fountains); though partly destroyed by the wall, it contains cool pond-gardens, fountains and truly extraordinary mosaics showing the four seasons and various hunting scenes.
The site’s most important villa, on the other side of the wall, is said to have belonged to one Cantaber, whose wife and children were seized by the Suevi in an attack in 465. It’s a palace of a place, with baths, pools and a sophisticated underground heating system.
Excavations continue in the outer areas. Eye-catching features include the remains of a 3km-long aqueduct, which led up to a hilltop bathing complex, and the forum, once surrounded by covered porticoes.
Check bus schedules as these change seasonally, with fewer buses outside summer. At the time of research, buses run from Coimbra directly to the ruins (€2.30, 45 minutes) at 9am, 9.30am and 12.30pm Monday to Friday; 9.30am, 12.30pm and 3.30pm Saturday; and 9.30am, 12.30pm and 3pm Sunday. Return-trip departures are at 1pm and 6pm Monday to Friday; 1.30pm and 6.30pm Saturday; and 2pm and 6.30pm Sunday. There are also half-hourly buses to Condeixa-a-Nova, which is a half-hour stroll from the ruins.
Luso & Mata Nacional do Buçaco
A retreat from the world for almost 2000 years, the slopes of the Serra do Buçaco are now home to the walled, 105-hectare Mata Nacional do Buçaco (or Bussaco). Harbouring an astounding 700 plant species, from huge Mexican cedars to tree-sized ferns, this national forest is equally fecund in terms of the poetry it has inspired. Generations of Coimbra’s literary types have enshrined the forest in the national imagination with breathless hymns to its mystical marriage of natural and spiritual beauty.
And in the midst of the forest stands a royal palace completed in 1907; despite the extravagance of its fairy-tale neo-Manueline facade, the dynasty fell just three years later.
The gateway is the quaint little spa town of Luso, whose spa waters are considered a balm. You can stay in Luso or the royal palace itself, otherwise it's an easy day trip from Coimbra.
History
The Luso and Buçaco area probably served as a Christian refuge as early as the 2nd century AD, although the earliest known hermitage was founded in the 6th century by Benedictine monks. In 1628 Carmelite monks embarked on an extensive programme of forestation. They planted exotic species, laid cobbled paths and enclosed the forest within high stone walls. The forest grew so renowned that in 1643 Pope Urban VIII decreed that anyone damaging the trees would be excommunicated.
The peace was briefly shattered in 1810, when Napoleon’s forces under Masséna were soundly beaten here by the Anglo-Portuguese army of the future Duke of Wellington (the battle is re-enacted here every 27 September). In 1834, when religious orders throughout Portugal were abolished, the forest became state property.
1Sights
oMata Nacional do BuçacoFOREST
(www.fmb.pt; car/cyclist/pedestrian €5/free/free; h8am-8pm Apr-Sep, to 6pm Oct-Mar)
The aromatic forest is criss-crossed with trails, dotted with crumbling chapels and graced with ponds, fountains and exotic trees. The most accessible paths lead to pretty Vale dos Fetos and Fonte Fria, where swans swim beneath a grand staircase. Among several fine viewpoints is Cruz Alta (545m). But the most fascinating paths are those leading to tiny chapels and hermitages, plus those following the religious trail 'Way of the Cross'.
What most visitors come to see is the fairy-tale Palace Hotel do Buçaco.
Now a luxury hotel, Palace Hotel do Buçaco was a royal summer retreat (completed in 1907) built on the site of a 17th-century Carmelite monastery. This wedding cake of a building is over the top in every way: outside, its conglomeration of turrets and spires is surrounded by rose gardens and swirling box hedges in geometrical patterns; inside (nonguests are more or less prohibited entry) are neo-Manueline carvings, suits of armour on the grand staircases and azulejos (tiles) illustrating scenes from Os Lusiados (The Lusiads), in which Portuguese armies win glorious battles at sea amid the dismayed looks of their stupefied opponents.
By road the Portas das Ameias, the nearest gate into the forest, is 900m from the centre. The hotel is 2.1km from the Portas das Ameias.
Santa Cruz do BussacoCHURCH
(www.fmb.pt; adult/child €2/1; h10am-1pm & 2-5pm Oct-Mar, to 6pm Apr-Sep)
Tucked away behind the Palace Hotel do Buçaco, this is what remains of a convent where the future Duke of Wellington rested after the Battle of Bussaco in 1810. The atmospheric interior has decaying religious paintings, an unusual walkway right around the chapel, some guns from the battle, and the much-venerated image of Nossa Senhora do Leite (Our Lady of the Milk), with a raft of ex-voto offerings.

8Getting There & Away
BUS
Buses (handier than the train) run five times each weekday (four only return from Luso) and twice daily on Saturdays from Coimbra’s main bus station to Luso (around €4, 40 minutes). In July and August they head to the Palace Hotel do Buçaco (around €4, 50 minutes).
CAR
If driving from Coimbra, ignore your GPS and make sure you take the lovely, foresty N235, which comes off the IP3: you'll save a toll, too.
TRAIN
Trains run three times Monday to Saturday (two on Sunday) from Coimbra B station to Luso/Buçaco station (€2.60, 25 minutes), but the inconvenient schedule makes a same-day round trip nearly impossible. From Luso/Buçaco station it’s a 15-minute walk to central Luso, plus another half hour uphill through the forest to the Palace Hotel.
Montemor-o-Velho
Perched high atop a rugged hill 25km west of Coimbra, glowering Castelo do Montemor-o-Velho dominates the surrounding marshland. Whether seen from a distance or from atop the castle walls themselves, it’s easy to imagine this site as an early Reconquista bastion.
Today you can walk the crenellated battlements and survey lush rice fields lying alongside the Rio Mondego far below. Inside little remains but part of the ruined Paço das Infantas (Princesses’ Palace), built by Afonso Henrique’s aunt Urraca, and the beautifully tiled Igreja de Santa Maria de Alcáçova, a small Romanesque church with 16th-century Manueline touches. It conserves some 18th-century wall paintings. The site’s strategic importance as a fortification dates back at least two millennia.

Perched high atop a rugged hill 25km west of Coimbra, the glowering walls of the Castelo do Montemor-o-Velho dominate the surrounding marshland. Whether seen from a distance or from atop the castle walls themselves, it’s easy to imagine this site as an early bastion in the Reconquista. Ferdinand I of Castile and León recaptured Montemor-o-Velho from the Moors in 1064, and within less than a century his great-grandson Afonso Henrique claimed it as part of his new Kingdom of Portugal.
Over the intervening centuries the castle was rebuilt and expanded several times, with most of the current structure dating from the 14th century.

Aveiro
Hugging the edge of the Ria, a shallow coastal lagoon rich in birdlife, Aveiro (uh-vey-roo), whose name might come from the Latin aviarium (place of birds), is a prosperous town with a youthful, energetic buzz. It's occasionally dubbed the Venice of Portugal thanks to its high-prowed boats, humpbacked bridges and small network of picturesque canals. It's a lovely little place best explored on foot or aboard a moliceiro – the traditional seaweed-harvesting boat now converted to tourist use.
History
A prosperous seaport in the early 16th century, Aveiro suffered a ferocious storm in the 1570s that blocked the mouth of the Rio Vouga, closing it to ocean-going ships and creating fever-breeding marshes. Over the next two centuries, Aveiro’s population shrank by three-quarters. But in 1808 the Barra Canal forged a passage back to the sea, and within a century Aveiro was rich once more, as evidenced by the spate of art nouveau houses that still define the town’s old centre. Salt harvested here was taken to Newfoundland to preserve cod that came back as bacalhau (dried salt-cod).

oReserva Natural das Dunas de São JacintoNATURE RESERVE
( GOOGLE MAP ; www.rotadabairrada.pt)
Stretching north from São Jacinto, between the sea and the lagoon west of Aveiro, is this supremely peaceful 6.7-sq-km wooded nature reserve, equipped with trails and birdwatching hides. A meandering 7km loop trail runs through the pines and dunes and can be walked at any time (you should register at the interpretative centre, however). The best birdwatching is from November to February.
At the trailhead, 1.5km north of the ferry on the N327, is a map, as well as a small, helpful interpretative centre.
To get here, take a bus from Aveiro to Forte da Barra (one way/return €2.50/4), where there is a ferry to São Jacinto (passenger/car return €3/5). Schedules for boats are at www.moveaveiro.pt; bus schedules are at www.transdev.pt. Drivers can also circumnavigate the lagoon and arrive from the north via Ovar, but it’s a much longer journey.

( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; %234 423 297; www.ipmuseus.pt; Avenida Santa Joana; €4, 10am-2pm Sun free; h10am-6pm Tue-Sun)
This fine museum in a beautiful space, the former Mosteiro de Jesus, owes its finest treasures to Princesa Joana (later canonised), daughter of Afonso V. In 1472, 11 years after the convent was founded, Joana ‘retired’ here and, though forbidden to take full vows, she stayed until her death in 1490.
The extraordinary painting collection spans the 10th to 15th centuries. Her tomb, a 17th-century masterpiece of inlaid marble mosaic, takes centre stage in an equally lavish room (the remodelled lower choir stalls). The adjacent gold-leafed chapel is decorated with azulejos depicting Princesa Joana’s life. The museum’s paintings include a late-15th-century portrait of her, attributed to Nuno Gonçalves.

The surfing venues of Praia da Barra and Costa Nova, 13km west of Aveiro, are good for a day’s outing. Prettier Costa Nova has a beachside street lined with cafes, kitsch gift shops and picturesque candy-striped cottages. Buses (one way/return €2.50/4, hourly) go from Aveiro's Rua Clube dos Galitos.
Wilder and more remote is Praia de São Jacinto, on the northern side of the lagoon. The vast beach of dunes is a 1.5km walk from São Jacinto port, through a residential area at the back of town. Be sure to visit the Dunas de São Jacinto Interpretative Centre. Take a bus from Aveiro to Forte da Barra (one way/return €2.50/4), where there is a ferry to São Jacinto (passenger/car return €3/5). Schedules for boats are at www.moveaveiro.pt; bus schedules are at www.transdev.pt. Drivers can also circumnavigate the lagoon and arrive from the north via Ovar, a much longer trip.
WORTH A TRIP
MUSEU MARÍTIMO DE ÍLHAVO

The wonderful Museu Marítimo de Ílhavo (%234 329 990; www.museumaritimo.cm-ilhavo.pt; Avenida Dr Rocha Madahil; €5; h10am-6pm Tue-Sat year-round, 2-6pm Sun Mar-Sep) is in a modern, award-winning building in the town of Ílhavo, 8km south of Aveiro. It covers the history of the maritime identity of the Portuguese, from cod fishing (with superb fishing vessels from the 19th and 20th centuries) to the oil paintings on the bows of the moliceiros (the traditional seaweed-harvesting boats). A highlight is the codfish aquarium, showcasing the Atlantic cod, which the Portuguese have been fishing (and munching on!) for centuries. Combined entry with the associated Santo André ship museum costs €6.50.

8Getting There & Away
BUS
Few long-distance buses terminate here – there isn’t even a bus station. Catch buses at the stop ( GOOGLE MAP ) on Rua Clube dos Galitos; many also stop at the train station.
Rede Expresso (www.rede-expressos.pt) has five to six daily services to/from Lisbon (€16, three to four hours), Coimbra (€6, 45 minutes) and Figueira da Foz (€8.30, 1¼ hours).

TRAIN
Trains run from the modern station, which has superseded the beautiful old tiled one alongside. Aveiro is within Porto’s urbano network, which means there are commuter trains there at least every half hour (€3.40, one hour); much pricier IC/AP links (€11.70/14.20, 30 to 40 minutes) are only slightly faster. There are also at least hourly links to Coimbra (regional/intercity/AP €5.25/11.70/14.20, 30 to 60 minutes) and several daily IC (€21.45, 2½ hours) and AP (€27.55, two hours) trains to Lisbon.

Braga
Portugal’s third-largest city is an elegant town laced with ancient narrow lanes closed to vehicles, strewn with plazas and a splendid array of baroque churches. The constant chiming of bells is a reminder of Braga’s age-old devotion to the spiritual world. Its religious festivals – particularly the elaborately staged Semana Santa (Holy Week) – are famous throughout Portugal. But don’t come expecting piety alone: Braga’s upscale old centre is packed with lively cafes and trim boutiques, some excellent restaurants and low-key bars catering to students from the Universidade do Minho. In fact, it's such a young city that in 2012 it was pronounced the European Youth Capital.
Just outside the city stands the magnificent, much-visited hillside church and sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte.
History
Founded by Romans, Braga was settled in the 1st century BC, named Bracara Augusta and made capital of the Roman province of Gallaecia. Braga’s position at the intersection of five Roman roads helped it grow fat on trade, but it fell to the Suevi around AD 410, and was sacked by the Visigoths 60 years later. The Visigoths’ conversion to Christianity in the 6th century and the founding of an archbishopric in the next century put the town atop the Iberian Peninsula’s ecclesiastical pecking order.
The Moors moved in around 715, sparking a long-running tug of war that ended when Fernando I, king of Castilla y León, definitively reconquered the city in 1040. The archbishopric was restored in 1070, though prelates bickered with their Spanish counterparts for the next 500 years over who was Primate of All Spain. The pope finally ruled in Braga’s favour, though the city’s resulting good fortune began to wane in the 18th century when a newly anointed Lisbon archdiocese stole much of its thunder.
Not surprisingly, it was from conservative Braga that António de Oliveira Salazar, with his unique blend of Catholicism and fascism, gave the speech that launched his 1926 coup, introducing Portugal to half a century of dictatorship.

Sé Cathedral ChoirCHURCH
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child €2/1)
The guided tour of the choir inside the Sé (cathedral) gives an up-close look at the mesmerising organs and gilded choir stalls. Visitors are led downstairs and into the cathedral’s showpiece Capela dos Reis (Kings’ Chapel), home to the tombs of Henri of Burgundy and Dona Teresa, parents of the first king of Portugal, Afonso Henriques.
You’ll also visit the azulejo (hand-painted tile)-covered Capela de São Geraldo (dating from the 12th century but reworked over the years) and the 14th-century Capela da Glória, whose interior was painted in unrepentantly Moorish geometric motifs in the 16th century.
Museu dos BiscainhosMUSEUM
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; Rua dos Biscainhos; adult/student €2/1, first Sun of the month free; h9.30am-12.45pm & 2-5.30pm Tue-Sun)
An 18th-century aristocrat’s palace is home to the enthusiastic municipal museum, with a nice collection of Roman relics and 17th- to 19th-century pottery and furnishings. The palace itself is the reason to come, with its polychrome, chestnut-panelled ceilings and 18th-century azulejos depicting hunting scenes. The ground floor is paved with deeply ribbed flagstones on which carriages would have once rattled through to the stables.
SéCATHEDRAL
( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; www.se-braga.pt; Rua Dom Paio Mendes; h9am-7pm high season, 9am-6.30pm low season)
Braga’s extraordinary cathedral, the oldest in Portugal, was begun when the archdiocese was restored in 1070 and completed in the following century. It’s a rambling complex made up of differing styles, and architecture buffs could spend half a day happily distinguishing the Romanesque bones from Manueline musculature and baroque frippery.
The original Romanesque style is the most interesting and survives in the cathedral’s overall shape, the southern entrance and the marvellous west portal, which is carved with scenes from the medieval legend of Reynard the Fox (now sheltered inside a Gothic porch). The most appealing external features are the filigree Manueline towers and roof – an early work by João de Castilho, who went on to build Lisbon’s Mosteiro dos Jerónimos.
You can enter the cathedral through the west portal or via a courtyard and cloister that’s lined with Gothic chapels on the north side. The church itself features a fine Manueline carved altarpiece, a tall chapel with azulejos telling the story of Braga’s first bishop, and fantastic twin baroque organs (held up by formidable satyrs and mermen), which are played at mass every Sunday at 11.30am.
Connected to the church is the treasury ( MAP GOOGLE MAP ; adult/child €3/2; h9am-12.30pm & 2.30-7pm high season, 9am-12.30pm & 2-6.30pm low season), housing a goldmine of ecclesiastical booty, including the lovely Nossa Senhora do Leite of the Virgin suckling Christ, attributed to 16th-century French sculptor Nicolas Chanterène. Other highlights are the iron cross that was used in 1500 to celebrate the very first Mass in Brazil.
To visit the choir, visitors must purchase a separate ticket and join a guided tour (some guides speak English), which gives an up-close look at the mesmerising organs and gilded choir stalls. Visitors will then be led downstairs and into the cathedral’s showpiece Capela dos Reis (Kings’ Chapel), home to the tombs of Henri of Burgundy and Dona Teresa, parents of the first king of Portugal, Afonso Henriques. You’ll also visit the azulejo-covered Capela de São Geraldo (dating from the 12th century but reworked over the years) and the 14th-century Capela da Glória, whose interior was painted in unrepentantly Moorish geometric motifs in the 16th century.

Braga's newest museum is housed inside Palácio do Raio, the extroverted work by André Soares, its rococo face covered in azulejos. The gorgeous interiors, also filled with azulejos, showcase works of sacred art, textiles, paintings, sculptures, jewellery and pottery, all bearing witness to 500 years of the building's history.

A Roman ruin opened to the public, this spring is set underneath a mod lobby. An essential community water source, it was carved into a fountain during pre-Roman times by Celicus Fronto, an immigrant from the city-state of Arcobriga. One carving is of a toga-clad pilgrim thought to be holding the horn of plenty. There’s an introductory video, too.

EASTER IN BRAGA

Semana SantaRELIGIOUS
Braga hosts the most elaborate Easter celebrations in Portugal. It kicks off with Semana Santa, when Gregorian chants are piped throughout the city centre and makeshift candlelit altars light the streets at night. The action heats up during Holy Thursday’s Procissão do Senhor Ecce Homo, when barefoot, hooded penitents – members of private Catholic brotherhoods – march through the streets spinning their eerie rattles.
The Good Friday celebration in the cathedral is a remarkable, elaborately staged drama with silk canopies, dirge-like hymns, dozens of priests and a weeping congregation. On Saturday evening, the Easter Vigil Mass begins dourly, the entire cathedral in shadow, only to explode in lights and jubilation. Finally, on Sunday, the people of Braga blanket their thresholds with flowers, inviting passing priests to enter and give their home a blessing.
zFestivals & Events
Festas de São JoãoCULTURAL
A pre-Christian solstice bash dressed up to look like holy days, this festival still bursts with pagan energy. Held for 10 days every June, it features medieval folk plays, processions, dancing, bonfires, fireworks – and thousands of little pots of basil. Basil is the symbol of São João (John the Baptist), and traditionally people write poems to loved ones and conceal them in their pots.
Locals also bust out squeaky plastic hammers and whack each other mercilessly.

8Getting There & Away
BUS
Braga has a centralised bus station that serves as a major regional hub.
Airport Bus (%253 262 371; www.getbus.eu) About 10 buses daily do the 50-minute run between the Porto airport and Braga, in each direction. The one-way fare is €8 (€4 for children), return is €14 (€8 for children).
Empresa Hoteleira do Gerês (%253 262 033) Serves Vila do Gerês (€4.30, 1½ hours) about hourly during the week, five times on Saturday and three times on Sunday.
Rede Expressos (www.rede-expressos.pt) Has up to 15 daily buses to Lisbon (€21, 4½ hours).
Transdev Norte/Arriva (%253 209 401) Has at least eight buses per day to Viana do Castelo (€4.45, 1½ hours), Barcelos (€2.65, one hour), Guimarães (€3.20, 50 minutes), Ponte de Lima (€3.85, one hour) and Porto (€4.80, one hour), plus four per day to Campo do Gerês (€4.20, 1½ hours). Service drops by half at weekends.
CAR & MOTORCYCLE
The A3 motorway makes Braga an easy day trip from Porto. The N101 from Braga to Guimarães is a good road for a slow ride.
Avic ( GOOGLE MAP ; %253 203 910; Rua Gabriel Pereira de Castro 28; h9am-7pm Mon-Fri, 9am-12.30pm Sat) An efficient agency for several car-rental companies, with prices starting at €35 per day.
TRAIN
Braga is at the end of a branch line from Nine and also within Porto’s suburbano network, which means commuter trains travel every hour or so from Porto (€3.10, about one hour); don’t waste €32.80 on an Alfa Pendular (AP) train.
Useful AP links include Coimbra (€19.80, 2¼ hours, five to seven daily) and Lisbon (€31, four hours, two to four daily).
Because of one-way and pedestrian-only streets, driving in central Braga is tricky, and most parking incurs a fee. There is a large, fee-charging car park under Praça da República. You might also try the side streets east of Avenida da Liberdade.





Guimarães
The proud birthplace of Afonso Henriques, the first independent king of Portugal (born here in 1110, he later used the city to launch the main thrust of the Reconquista against the Moors), and, thus, the Portuguese kingdom, Guimarães has beautifully preserved its illustrious past. Its medieval centre is a warren of labyrinthine lanes and picturesque plazas framed by 14th-century edifices, while on an adjacent hill stands a 1000-year-old castle and the massive palace built by the first duke of Bragança in the 15th century. Guimarães’ glory was recognised in 2001, when Unesco declared its old centre a World Heritage Site. In 2012, the city was the European Capital of Culture, which has given it a more creative edge.
On top of the city's historical treasures, museums and cultural institutions, there are cafe-filled plazas, atmospheric guest houses and delightful restaurants. Plus, Guimarães is a university town, its students lending much vitality to the place.

For the 2012 European Capital of Culture the old market square was revamped into a multipurpose cultural centre inside a shimmering three-floor metallic building that looks like a bunch of stacked-up boxes.

Paço dos Duques de BragançaPALACE
( GOOGLE MAP ; Rua Conde D Henrique; adult/child €5/free; h9am-6pm)
Looming over the medieval city on Guimarães’ hilltop, with its crenellated towers and cylindrical brick chimneys, Paço dos Duques was first built in 1401 and later pompously restored as a presidential residence for Salazar. Today it's open to visitors who can wander through the rooms, which house a collection of Flemish tapestries, medieval weapons, a chapel with glittering stained-glass windows and enormous tapestries that relate various episodes in the Portuguese attempt to conquer North Africa.
PenhaVIEWPOINT
Some 7km southeast up a twisting, cobbled road – or a short ride on an ageing cable car – is the wooded summit of Penha (617m) overlooking Guimarães, the highest point for kilometres. Its cool woods make it a wonderful escape from the city and summer heat. Kids love losing themselves amid the massive boulders, many cut with steps, crowned with flowers and crosses, or hiding in secret grottoes.
On the lower slopes of the hill lies the Mosteiro de Santa Marinha da Costa, 1.5km east of Penha’s centre. It dates from 1154, when Dona Mafalda, wife of Afonso Henriques, commissioned it to honour a vow she made to the patron saint of pregnant women. Rebuilt in the 18th century, it’s now a flagship Pousada de Portugal.
The easiest and finest route to the top of Penha is aboard the Teleférico de Penha (Cable Car; GOOGLE MAP ; one way/return €3/5; h10am-7pm Mon-Fri, to 8pm Sat & Sun Jun & Jul, 10am-8pm daily Aug), which starts from Parque das Hortas, 600m east of Guimarães’ old centre. You can also get there by taxi for €8.

The monument outside the church is a Gothic canopy and cross, reputedly marking the spot where the great Wamba the Visigoth, victorious over the Suevi, drove his spear into the ground beside an olive tree and refused to reign unless a tree sprouted from the handle. In true legendary fashion, it did just that.
